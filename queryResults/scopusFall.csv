Most of the plastic debris found in the marine environment originates from land-based sources, and once in the marine environment, plastic can be degraded into smaller fragments. Nanoplastics are considered to fall within the definition of other nanoparticles (1–100 nm in size) and may be divided into primary or secondary nanoplastics. Primary nanoplastics are those that enter the environment in their original small size associated with specific applications and consumer products, whilst secondary nanoplastics are a consequence of macro/microplastic degradation. The formation of nanoplastics changes the physical-chemical characteristics of the particle, thus at a nanoscale, it is expected that the strength, conductivity, and reactivity of the nanoparticles will differ substantially from macro/micro-sized particles. To date, the toxicity nanoplastics may pursue on marine biota is still scarce. Herein, a review of the available data on the effects of different polymer types of nanoplastics specific to marine biota is accounted for. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",2-s2.0-85099659919

The objective of this study was to analyze the succession of micro- and mesozooplankton during a warm annual cycle (December 2010-December 2011) in an Antarctic coastal environment (Potter Cove). The biomass of zooplankton body size classes was used to predict predator-prey size relationships (i.e., to test bottom-up/top-down control effects) using a Multiple Linear Regression Analysis. The micro- and mesozooplanktonic successions were graphically analyzed to detect the influence of environmental periods (defined by the degree of glacial melting, sea-ice freezing and sea-ice melting) on coupling/uncoupling planktonic biomass curves associated to possible predator-prey size relationship scenarios. At the beginning of the glacial melting, medium and large mesozooplankton (calanoid copepods, Euphausia superba, and Salpa thompsoni) exert a top-down control on Chl-a and microzooplankton. Stratification of the water column benefitted the availability of adequate food-size (Chl-a <20) for large microzooplankton (tintinnids) development observed during fall. High abundance of omnivores mesozooplankton (Oithona similis and furcilia of E. superba) during sea-ice freezing periods would be due to the presence of available heterotrophic food under or within the sea ice. Finally, the increase in microzooplankton abundance in the middle of spring, when sea-ice melting starts, corresponded to small and medium dinoflagellates and ciliates species, which were possibly part of the biota of sea ice. If glacier retreat continues and the duration and thickness of the sea ice layer fluctuates as predicted by climate models, our results predict a future scenario regarding the zooplankton succession in Antarctic coastal environments. © 2020 Garcia et al.

The trophic information for this species during the transition from the austral fall to the winter is important to understand its poorly known overwintering mechanisms. However, the few studies on the topic differ in their results, in terms of both spatial and temporal variables. We investigated the size dependence and monthly and regional variation in δ13C and δ15N values of adult krill in the Antarctic Peninsula, in the austral fall (April to May) and the early winter (June). We aimed to examine the trophic variations of krill occurred during this period, and the relationship between krill and their feeding environment in the Antarctic marine ecosystem. The following results were obtained: (1) no significant relationship was observed between size and the δ13C value of krill, but the δ15N value of krill presented a remarkable association with size; (2) the δ13C values of krill increased during the austral fall, but no remarkable variation existed at the onset of winter, and the δ15N values were not significant different during this period; (3) mean δ15N values of krill differed significantly between the Bransfield Strait and the South Shetland Islands.

We used a minimally realistic ecosystem model to examine how projected effects of ocean warming on the growth of Antarctic krill, Euphausia superba, might affect populations of krill and dependent predators (whales, penguins, seals, and fish) in the Scotia Sea. We also investigated the potential to mitigate depletion risk for predators by curtailing krill fishing at different points in the 21st century. The projected effects of ocean warming on krill biomass were strongest in the northern Scotia Sea, with a ≥40% decline in the mass of individual krill. Projections also suggest a 25% chance that krill biomass will fall below an established depletion threshold (75% of its unimpacted level), with consequent risks for some predator populations, especially penguins. Average penguin abundance declined by up to 30% of its unimpacted level, with up to a 50% chance of falling below the depletion threshold. Simulated krill fishing at currently permitted harvest rates further increased risks for depletion, and stopping fishing offset the increased risks associated with ocean warming in our model to some extent. These results varied by location and species group. Risk reductions at smaller spatial scales also differed from those at the regional level, which suggests that some predator populations may be more vulnerable than others to future changes in krill biomass. However, impacts on predators did not always map directly to those for krill. Our findings indicate the importance of identifying vulnerable marine populations and targeting protection measures at appropriate spatial scales, and the potential for spatially-structured management to avoid aggravating risks associated with rising ocean temperatures.

By combining high-resolution satellite-tagged data with hierarchical Bayesian movement models, we can associate spatial patterns of movement with marine animal behavior. We used a multi-state mixture model to describe humpback whale traveling and area-restricted search states as they forage along the West Antarctic Peninsula. We estimated the change in the geography, composition and characteristics of these behavioral states through time. We show that whales later in the austral fall spent more time in movements associated with foraging, traveled at lower speeds between foraging areas, and shifted their distribution northward and inshore. Seasonal changes in movement are likely due to a combination of sea ice advance and regional shifts in the primary prey source. Our study is a step towards dynamic movement models in the marine environment at broad scales. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.",2-s2.0-85029492827

Study sites were located within four hypothesized hydrographic regions: near Joinville Island in Region I, at Croker Passage, near Anvers Island, and near Renaud Island in Region II, within Marguerite Bay and the Marguerite Trough in Region III, and near Charcot Island in Region IV. A total of 62 taxa representing 12 taxonomic groups of pelagic invertebrates and 9 families of fish were captured, but assemblages were dominated by only a few species. The most numerically abundant taxa were the euphausiids, Thysanoessa macrura, Euphausia superba, and E. crystallorophias, combining to contribute nearly 79% of the total catch. Biomass dominants included E. superba, which contributed more than 44% of the total catch, the notothenioid Pleuragramma antarctica, and the salp, Salpa thompsoni. A comparison of total catches among sites revealed that the largest volumetric abundances and biomasses were captured at the Marguerite Bay site.Cluster analysis of abundance data identified distinct multispecies assemblages at Joinville Island in Region I, Croker Passage in Region II, Marguerite Bay in Region III, and Charcot Island in Region IV. A fifth distinct assemblage included samples from sites near Anvers and Renaud Island in Region II, and from the Marguerite Trough in Region III. Assemblages at Joinville Island and Croker Passage were both dominated by E. superba and S. thompsoni, but hydrographic conditions at Joinville Island favored a neritic assemblage, underscored by substantial numbers of P. antarctica. The assemblage at Croker Passage was more oceanic in nature with major inputs from the myctophid, Electrona antarctica and the hyperiid amphipod, Themisto gaudichaudii. Marguerite Bay and Charcot Island were well-mixed assemblages with strong representation by both neritic and oceanic fauna. The mid-peninsula assemblage was oceanic in character, being overwhelmingly dominated by Thysanoessa macrura and T. gaudichaudii.Pleuragramma antarctica were captured at five sites: Joinville Island, Croker Passage, Marguerite Bay, and the two sites near Charcot Island. They were completely absent at the two sites near Anvers Island, at Renaud Island, and in the Marguerite Trough. One fish was captured in Croker Passage. The majority of fish captured in Marguerite Bay were larger than 150 mm standard length (SL), with very few fish of smaller size present. If resident populations of Pleuragramma reproduce and recruit locally rather than being sustained by larval advection, those populations will be highly susceptible to local disappearance. This may be the causative factor behind the absence of Pleuragramma from the mid-peninsula region. Continued warming and subsequent sea ice reductions may not only cause Pleuragramma population collapses in the Marguerite Bay and Charcot Island regions, but may also change the character of the faunal assemblages along the WAP to those of an oceanic system. © 2015.",2-s2.0-84939506886

These whales acquire their annual energetic needs during an episodic feeding season in high latitude waters that must sustain long-distance migration and fasting on low-latitude breeding grounds. Antarctic krill are broadly distributed along the continental shelf and nearshore waters during the spring and early summer, and move closer to land during late summer and fall, where they overwinter under the protective and nutritional cover of sea ice. We apply a novel space-time utilization distribution method to test the hypothesis that humpback whale distribution reflects that of krill: spread broadly during summer with increasing proximity to shore and associated embayments during fall. Results: Humpback whales instrumented with satellite-linked positional telemetry tags (n = 5), show decreased home range size, amount of area used, and increased proximity to shore over the foraging season. Conclusions: This study applies a new method to model the movements of humpback whales in the WAP region throughout the feeding season, and presents a baseline for future observations of the seasonal changes in the movement patterns and foraging behavior of humpback whales (one of several krill-predators affected by climate-driven changes) in the WAP marine ecosystem. As the WAP continues to warm, it is prudent to understand the ecological relationships between sea-ice dependent krill and krill predators, as well as the interactions among recovering populations of krill predators that may be forced into competition for a shared food resource. © 2015 Curtice et al.",2-s2.0-85006589986

A vesselmounted acoustic Doppler current profiler (ADCP) and a calibrated EK-60 echo sounder were used to assess circulation patterns and krill distributions in the bay, and a multiple opening and closing net (with 333 μm mesh) and environmental sensing system (MOCNESS) was used to collect live samples of mesozooplankton and krill for taxonomic composition analysis. The results from this field study complement a previous one that examined an anticyclonic bay-scale circulation of Antarctic krill. This super-aggregation of krill covered ̃100 km 2, had a concentration of 1000s of individuals m -2 and was associated with more than 306 humpback whales present in Wilhelmina Bay. Our results from the mesozooplankton study revealed that krill continuously conducted diel vertical migrations and formed aggregations in the inner bay, while the chlorophyll concentration at the surface decreased from 2.2 to 0.6 g C m -2 due to the decrease of daylight, and zooplankton concentrations increased from 0.5 to 1.5 g C m -2 probably from advective influx. Most zooplankton were distributed below 200 m while krill fed in the upper 150 m. The spatial and temporal correlations between krill and small- to medium-sized mesozooplankton imply that krill may become omnivorous when there is a lack of phytoplankton in the late austral fall. Though both phytoplankton and zooplankton biomasses contributed only small fractions of the daily ration needed for krill metabolism in Wilhelmina Bay, it is not clear what caused krill to aggregate on such a large scale, as this led to high mortality as a result of starvation and predation by whales and other top predators. © Inter-Research 2012.",2-s2.0-84860253970

An individual-based model was developed to investigate patterns of larval krill growth and condition factor in response to environmental variability during fall and winter, west of the Antarctic Peninsula. Field and experimental observations from Southern Ocean Global Ocean Ecosystems Dynamics cruises in 2001 and 2002 and the Palmer Long-Term Ecological Research program were used to parameterize the model. Growth was modeled by partitioning total body carbon between length and condition factor. Total body carbon was simulated with empirical temperature- dependent rates of ingestion of phytoplankton and respiration, and ingestion of algae grown on a surface to simulate sea ice algae. Light-driven diel vertical migration modulated ingestion of phytoplankton and sea ice algae as a function of latitude, season and sea ice cover. Simulations highlighted 3 environmental processes that controlled food availability, and consequently, physiological condition of krill: the fall phytoplankton decline, sea ice advance and development of sea ice microbial communities, and the late winter increase in sea ice microbial community biomass. Fall phytoplankton dynamics were identified as a major driver of the physiological condition of larval krill throughout this critical period. The model presents a mechanism that links larval krill survival and recruitment to fall and winter variability in phytoplankton and sea ice dynamics along the western Antarctic Peninsula. © Inter-Research 2012.",2-s2.0-84860249668

Vertical distributions of zooplankton usually were similar to those reported for other Antarctic regions. Maximum abundances of the copepods Ctenocalanus spp. and Calanus propinquus, the euphausiids Euphausia superba, Euphausia crystallorophias, and Thysanoessa macrura, and appendicularians primarily occurred in shallow Antarctic Surface Water (<100. m) or the upper pycnocline. The copepod, Oncaea spp., mysids, and ostracods had the deepest distributions (>250. m), in warmer modified Circumpolar Deep Water. Other dominant copepods (. Calanoides acutus, Metridia gerlachei, Oithona spp., Paraeuchaeta spp., and Rhincalanus gigas), pteropods, and chaetognaths had depths of maximum abundance within the pycnocline or in deeper warmer waters. Overlapping depth distributions suggest that E. superba would have the highest prey encounter rates with M. gerlachei, Ctenocalanus spp., C. propinquus, and Oithona spp. during fall, although most of the copepod community was deeper than the euphausiid community. Even though the three euphausiid species occupied similar depth ranges on average, at any given location E. superba, E. crystallorophias, and T. macrura depths of maximum abundance often did not overlap, suggesting vertical habitat partitioning behavior. The vertical patterns of copepods, euphausiids, amphipods, and mysids did not have a consistent association with the distributions of pigments, temperature, salinity, or density. Instead, the observed vertical distributions are mainly attributed to different behaviors, including seasonal vertical migration to deeper water for overwintering (i.e., C. acutus, R. gigas, ostracods, chaetognaths, pteropods) and vertical habitat partitioning to reduce competition (i.e., euphausiids). Migration into deep water and aggregation behavior (i.e., euphausiids) also reduce the risk of predation. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.",2-s2.0-79958002368

The goals of this study are to examine sub-regional scale population genetic diversity and structure of E. superba using molecular characters selected with this goal in mind, and to thereby examine hypotheses of the source(s) of recruitment for krill populations of the Western Antarctic Peninsula (WAP). Collections were made throughout the WAP region during US GLOBEC cruises in austral fall, 2001 and 2002. A total of 585 E. superba (including all 6 furcilia larval stages, juveniles, and adults) was analyzed after confirmation of species identification using a competitive multiplexed species-specific PCR (SS-PCR) reaction based on mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I (mtCOI) sequences. The molecular markers used were allele frequencies at single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) sites in the gene encoding mitochondrial Cytochrome b (cyt b). Four SNP sites that showed desirable patterns of allelic variation were selected; alleles were detected using a multiplexed single-base extension PCR protocol. A total of 22 SNP haplotypes (i.e., strings of polymorphisms at the four SNP sites) was observed; haplotype diversity (Hd)=0.811 (s.d.=0.008). Analysis of molecular variation within and among samples, areas (i.e., Marguerite Bay, Crystal Sound, shelf, and offshore) and collection years revealed no difference between 2001 and 2002 collections overall, although differences between 2001 and 2002 collections from Marguerite Bay explained 7.4% of the variance (FST=0.072; p=0.002±0.001). Most of the variation (96.3%) occurred within samples each year, with no significant differentiation among areas. There was small, but significant differentiation among samples within areas in 2001 (4.6%; FST=0.045; p=0.015±0.003) and 2002 (6.3%; FST=0.062; p=0.000±0.000). There was evidence of life stage-specific spatial differentiation for furcilia in 2002 for F1 (18.1%, p=0.000±0.000) and F2 (9.2%, p=0.001±0.001). The significant differentiation among samples for E. superba within areas was interpreted as evidence of multiple sources of recruitment of E. superba in the WAP region, consistent with advective transport in observed circulation patterns and reproduction and spawning in both offshore and shelf habitats. Further population genetic analysis at sub-regional scales is needed to understand and eventually predict population dynamic processes (e.g., recruitment, migration, retention, and over-wintering) of Southern Ocean krill. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.",2-s2.0-79957996372

A total of 62 trawls were completed during four separate cruises in the austral fall (April-June) and winter (July-September) of 2001 and 2002. Crustaceans dominated the system in both seasons, accounting for 32 of the 55 species captured in the fall and 30 of the 48 species captured in winter. In both seasons, a very few species made up the majority of the catch. In the fall, the euphausiids Euphausia crystallorophias, Euphausia superba, and Thysanoessa macrura, and the mysid Antarctomysis ohlinii numerically dominated the assemblage, contributing over 85% of the total. In the winter, the same three euphausiids and the chaetognath Pseudosagitta gazellae were the numerical dominants, comprising over 90% of the catch. A significant increase in total abundance and biomass was observed from 2001 to 2002. The invertebrate micronekton/macrozooplankton communities found in the Marguerite Bay region of the WAP were a mixture of oceanic and neritic fauna: a direct result of local hydrographic conditions. Near the shelf break and in the outer reaches of the Marguerite Trough, a deep canyon transecting the shelf in a south-southeast direction, the communities were more diverse, dominated by oceanic species such as Euphausia triacantha, Salpa thompsoni, and Themisto gaudichaudi. The assemblages present in the nearshore fjords exhibited lower diversity and were dominated by neritic species such as E. crystallorophias and A. ohlinii. At the mid-shelf and mid-trough locations, the assemblages were composed of a variable mixture of oceanic and neritic fauna. The faunal mixing and overall species composition in those areas is the result of episodic Circumpolar Deep Water (CDW) intrusions onto the shelf via deep bathymetric features such as the Marguerite Trough. Species diversity and integrated abundance for the upper 200. m of the water column were similar between seasons in the WAP study region, but integrated biomass was nearly three times greater in fall than in winter. Integrated estimates from the WAP study region were similar to those from other studies conducted in the Scotia and Weddell Seas, but were orders of magnitude lower than estimates from a study in Croker Passage, primarily due to a large catch of E. superba. In contrast, species diversity in the WAP was higher than recorded in any of the previously mentioned studies, which is due to the mixing of typical oceanic fauna with endemic nearshore fauna. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.",2-s2.0-79957994282

Interannual differences were observed in zooplankton species composition, developmental stages, and abundances, which were linked to unusually high chlorophyll concentrations in the Bellingshausen Sea and Marguerite Bay during spring-summer 2000/2001. Copepod abundance was significantly higher in 2001 than in 2002 (46.3 and 28.3indm-3 in 2001 and 2002, respectively). During 2001, the copepod community was dominated by two species. Calanoides acutus, a herbivore, and Metridia gerlachei, an omnivore, accounted for 46% and 45% of the community, respectively. During 2002, however, several species were relatively abundant, including M. gerlachei, Ctenocalanus spp., C. acutus, Oithona spp., and Paraeuchaeta spp. Euphausiids also showed a rapid population response to high chlorophyll levels in 2001. Even though average total euphausiid (juvenile/adult) abundances were similar during both years (0.20 and 0.15indm-3 for 2001 and 2002, respectively), species composition showed marked interannual differences due to varying life history strategies among species. Thysanoessa macrura, which has a relatively rapid development from larval to juvenile stages between spring and fall of the same year, was the most abundant euphausiid in 2001. In contrast, Euphausia crystallorophias and Euphausia superba juvenile/adult populations increased in 2002, owing to a slower development in which larval stages overwinter and recruit to juveniles during the following spring/summer. Other zooplankton groups those were abundant in Marguerite Bay, but showed little variability between years, included ostracods, pteropods, chaetognaths, medusae, amphipods, and mysids. Summer phytoplankton concentrations strongly influenced copepods and euphausiids; however, there were no clear associations between zooplankton distributions and fall environmental conditions (i.e., pigment concentrations and surface salinity) or bottom depth. It is notable that ostracods and pteropods had the highest abundances of non-copepod zooplankton. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.",2-s2.0-79957990658

Euphausia superba) and has physiological constraints and foraging behaviors that dictate their ecological niches. Understanding the degree of ecological overlap between sympatric krill predators is critical to understanding and predicting the impacts on climate-driven changes to the Antarctic marine ecosystem. To explore ecological relationships amongst sympatric krill predators, we developed ecological niche models using a maximum entropy modeling approach (Maxent) that allows the integration of data collected by a variety of means (e.g. satellite-based locations and visual observations). We created spatially explicit probability distributions for the four krill predators in fall 2001 and 2002 in conjunction with a suite of environmental variables. We find areas within Marguerite Bay with high krill predator occurrence rates or biological hot spots. We find the modeled ecological niches for Adélie penguins and crabeater seals may be affected by their physiological needs to haul-out on substrate. Thus, their distributions may be less dictated by proximity to prey and more so by physical features that over time provide adequate access to prey. Humpback and minke whales, being fully marine and having greater energetic demands, occupy ecological niches more directly proximate to prey. We also find evidence to suggest that the amount of overlap between modeled niches is relatively low, even for species with similar energetic requirements. In a rapidly changing and variable environment, our modeling work shows little indication that krill predators maintain similar ecological niches across years around Marguerite Bay. Given the amount of variability in the marine environment around the Antarctic Peninsula and how this affects the local abundance of prey, there may be consequences for krill predators with historically little niche overlap to increase the potential for interspecific competition for shared prey resources. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.",2-s2.0-79957974127

The U.S. GLOBEC Southern Ocean program studied factors that contribute to the overwintering success of krill in the region of Marguerite Bay, WAP. A MOCNESS net system was used to sample the vertical distribution and abundance of zooplankton relative to physical features (hydrography and circulation) during four broad-scale survey cruises in the fall and winter of 2001 and 2002. Four species were found throughout the study area on all four cruises: Euphausia superba, Euphausia crystallorophias, Euphausia triacantha, and Thysanoessa macrura. The species had significantly different horizontal and vertical distributions. Both E. superba and T. macrura were broadly distributed throughout the area, but the central 50% of their vertical distributions were distinct with E. superba most abundant in the upper 100. m in the coldest, freshest water (average temperature and salinity: -1.13 °C; 33.80) and T. macrura occurring between 100 and 250. m (at 0.01 °C; 34.228). E. crystallorophias had a more coastal distribution and was usually found deeper in slightly warmer and saltier water (-0.44 °C; 33.9982) than E. superba and either overlapped or was above T. macrura in depth. E. triacantha was much rarer and sporadically distributed in the study area and was found substantially deeper (center of distribution about 300. m) in the warmest saltiest water (1.40 °C; 34.65) than the other three euphausiid species. Larval distributions for E. superba indicated that at least some proportion of the populations resulted from reproduction and development on the continental shelf, and not solely from offshore reproduction and transport onto the shelf. A neutral particle tracking model was used to gain insight into the relative importance of shelf versus off-shelf origins for the larvae. The results suggest that a combination of offshore and onshore reproduction can account for the observed E. superba larval distributions in the U.S. SO GLOBEC study site. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.",2-s2.0-79955970036

We used a 10m2 MOCNESS to collect macrozooplankton and micronekton in the upper 300m of the water column near free-drifting icebergs in the Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean during three seasons: December 2005 (late spring), June 2008 (late fall) and March-April 2009 (late summer). Communities were dominated in all three seasons by Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) and salps (Salpa thompsoni), which collectively comprised 60-95% of the community wet biomass in most cases. During our spring and summer cruises, mean biomass was elevated by 3.1-4.3x at a distance of 0.37km from large icebergs vs. 9.26km away. These differences were not statistically significant, and no trend in biomass with distance was apparent in samples from fall 2008, when total biomass was an order of magnitude lower. Biomass levels near icebergs during Dec 2005 and Mar-Apr 2009 were comparable to values reported from marginal ice zones, suggesting that waters around icebergs support macrozooplankton and micronekton communities comparable in magnitude to those in some of the most productive areas of the Southern Ocean. Sample variance also was significantly higher within 1.85km of icebergs during Dec 2005 and Mar-Apr 2009, reflecting increased patchiness on scales sampled by the MOCNESS (20-40×103m3 filtered per sample). This pattern was not significant during Jun 2008. Large predatory medusae were observed within 1.85km of icebergs and in Iceberg Alley, an area through which icebergs pass frequently, but were virtually absent in areas remote from icebergs. Small euphausiids showed an inverse distribution, with low densities in areas populated by large medusae. A shift in community composition from a near-iceberg assemblage dominated by herbivores to a carnivore-dominated community in Iceberg Alley may reflect a transition from bottom-up to top-down control with increasing distance and time. Body sizes of dominant species varied seasonally but did not show consistent trends with distance from icebergs. Concentrations of photosynthetic pigments in the guts of E. superba and S. thompsoni corresponded broadly to patterns in surface chlorophyll a concentrations and were comparable to maximum gut pigment concentrations measured in animals collected from highly productive marginal ice zones. Our results suggest that the macrozooplankton and micronekton assemblages near free-drifting icebergs can be quantitatively and qualitatively different from those in surrounding, iceberg-free waters, perhaps due to both bottom-up and top-down processes as well as physical forcing by the passage of a large object through the upper ocean. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.",2-s2.0-79955477761

We hypothesized that phytoplankton communities would differ in abundance, composition and production around or close to an iceberg. This paper tests the influence of individual icebergs on scales of meters to kilometers, observed through shipboard oceanographic sampling on March-April 2009. Surface waters (integrated 0-100. m depth, within the euphotic zone) sampled close to the iceberg C-18a (<1. km) were characterized by lower temperatures, more dissolved nitrate, less total chlorophyll a (chla) concentration, less picoplankton (<3. γm) cell abundance, and higher transparency than surface conditions 18. km upstream. However, enrichment of large cells, identified as diatoms, was the basis of an active food chain. Upward velocity of meltwater and dissolved Fe concentrations in excess of 1-2. nM are expected to facilitate diatom specific growth. The presence of diatoms close to the iceberg C-18a and the higher variable fluorescence (Fv/Fm) indicated healthy cells, consistent with Antarctic waters rich in micronutrients. Furthermore, chla increased significantly 2. km around the iceberg and 10 days after the iceberg's passage. We hypothesize that the lower biomass next to the iceberg was due to high loss rates. Underwater melting is expected to dilute phytoplankton near the iceberg by entraining deep water or by introducing meltwater. In addition, high zooplankton biomass within 2. km of the iceberg, mainly Antarctic krill Euphausia superba and salps Salpa thompsonii, are expected to exert heavy grazing pressure on phytoplankton, the krill on large cells >10. γm and the salps on smaller cells, 3-10. γm. The iceberg's main influence in the austral fall is measured not so much by phytoplankton accumulation but by reactivation of the classic Antarctic food chain, facilitating diatom growth and sustaining high Antarctic krill populations. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.",2-s2.0-79955473970

Climatology patterns showed that the Bellingshausen Sea and Marguerite Bay region usually had higher chlorophyll a concentrations, which persisted throughout austral spring and summer, compared with more northern regions along the Antarctic Peninsula and the western Scotia Sea. These predictable and long-lasting phytoplankton accumulations could provide krill with the food levels required for successful reproduction and larval survival. Unusually high krill reproduction in 2000/2001 was coincident with above-average chlorophyll a concentrations throughout most of the study area and resulted in the largest juvenile recruitment (in 2001/2002) since 1981. High larval densities (up to 132 ind m-3) at the shelf break along the Antarctic Peninsula may have resulted, in part, from krill spawning in the Bellingshausen Sea. In general, ice-edge blooms were only a significant feature in the southern sectors of our study area, particularly in the Bellingshausen Sea and, thus, may not support krill reproduction in the northern Peninsula region as previously believed. Instead, phytoplankton blooms during spring in the northern region appeared to be governed by shelf-break processes, such as upwelling of iron-rich deep water. Interannual differences in sea ice also probably contributed to the variability in larval krill abundances observed in Marguerite Bay. Sea ice melted early in 2000/2001, allowing elevated phytoplankton blooms to develop. In contrast, sea ice persisted throughout spring and summer 2001/2002 limiting phytoplankton accumulation, particularly in southern Marguerite Bay. Thus, the early and extended availability of elevated chlorophyll a concentrations during spring and summer 2000/2001, particularly in the vicinity of Marguerite Bay and to the south in the Bellingshausen Sea, as well as reduced sea ice in coastal areas, likely supported the unusually high densities of larval krill observed during fall in waters west of the Antarctic Peninsula. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

The distribution of krill aggregations was characterized by many small aggregations closely spaced relative to one another, punctuated by much fewer aggregations of very large size that accounted for the majority of overall biomass in the region. The greatest number of aggregations was found at depths less than 100 m, but biomass was usually greatest at deeper depths. Similar biomass levels were estimated for both the fall surveys and the winter of 2002 survey, while biomass during the winter of 2001 was an order of magnitude smaller. During fall, biomass estimates vertically integrated over the sampled portion of the water column were negatively associated with chlorophyll a concentrations, and some suggestion was observed of highest biomass in regions of lowest current magnitude and horizontal current gradient. Generalized additive models indicated that highest krill biomass was consistently associated with regions close to land where the temperature maximum below 200 m depth was cooler than what was available over the shelf as a whole. Krill were thus not associated with regions where intrusions of warm and nutrient-rich circumpolar deep water onto the shelf were present, despite such intrusions being thought to be an important driver of primary productivity. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

The experiments showed furcilia to have much higher grazing rates on copepods and ciliates than on algae, with positive selection for ciliates that was not influenced by the presence or absence of O. similis.

Krill densities vary considerably in time and space, while available data suggest that pelagic fishes show less seasonal and spatial change.

The kinematics of aggregation behavior of E. superba associated with diel migration is studied using observations of their abundance and swimming velocities: during the day, E. superba reduce their swimming at a depth of 250 m; and at night, they swim randomly at their cruising speed in the upper part of an aggregation near the surface, and coherently as schooling in the lower part of an aggregation. The causes for the aggregation behavior and vertical migration of krill are explored by examining the relationship with ice coverage and presence of predators. The motion of euphausiids is further analyzed in terms of kinetic energy and force balance, leading to new considerations of mathematical theories and models of aggregation behavior. The results show a diel variation of the energy demand for maintaining their locomotion. The horizontal scale of an aggregation is studied in conjunction with horizontal gradients of currents. Results indicate that the swimming capability of euphausiids determines the maintenance of an aggregation in the mesoscale circulation field. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

Previous studies have provided evidence that krill utilize zooplankton through austral winter when the primary production is negligible. Though they are different, all survival strategies produce the same result, a decrease in total zooplankton biomass. It is difficult to examine the total zooplankton biomass balance and process rates from traditional net tow samples because of the spatial variation in zooplankton distribution and the lack of applicable mathematical methods to estimate population process rates. This study focuses on short-term (overnight) loss rates of mesozooplankton associated with adult krill grazing in austral fall and the long-term (winter) body growth and removal rates of mesozooplankton in austral winter based on measurements of zooplankton size structures obtained using an Optical Plankton Counter (OPC) mounted on a Multiple Opening and Closing Nets and Environmental Sensing System (MOCNESS). In order to target an adult Euphausia superba aggregation for a short period, a 153 kHz Vessel-Mounted (VM) Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP) was used for the acoustic backscattering. The in situ process rates of growth and mortality are estimated based on the biomass balance and biomass spectrum theory. The overnight in situ grazing by adult E. superba on mesozooplankton is examined based on the in situ measurements of mesozooplankton biovolume within the water where an adult E. superba aggregation remained during a short study period in late April. The measurements show that approximately 16% of the existing mesozooplankton biovolume was removed in 4 h, which leads to an average specific daily grazing rate of 0.96day -1 assuming a daily feeding period of 16 h from dusk to dawn. From the amount of biovolume removed and the abundance of adult euphausiids of approximately 3 individuals m -3 estimated from the volume backscattering strength and the size of adult euphausiids, the daily ration for an adult euphausiid is approximately equal to 7% body biovolume or biomass day -1. The total mesozooplankton biovolume decreased at a specific rate of 0.017day -1 over the austral winter 2002, while the specific individual body growth was approximately 0.045day -1. The sum of these two rates leads to the specific mortality rate equal to approximately 0.07day -1 for the winter. These rates lead to a system efficiency of 67% for recycling the biomass during the winter. The measurements indicate that approximately 90% of biovolume (biomass) was removed in the period between the fall cruise in April-May and the winter cruise in August-September 2002. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

Blue and minke whales feed mainly on krill, and they share a similar feeding area near the Antarctic ice edge. In the early 20th century, the large baleen whales in the Antarctic were heavily harvested, some to near extinction. Blue whales were taken for almost 60 years, before being officially protected in 1964. Harvesting of the smaller minke whales commenced only in the 1970s, and the population probably increased during the mid 20th century, likely in response to increased krill abundance following the depletion of the large baleen whales. Recent studies show recoveries of some of these large baleen whale species in response to protection, and also a possible recent decrease in the stock of minke whales as the larger whales recover. This work investigates whether the abundance trends indicated by surveys and other information for these species can be explained by considering only harvesting and the predator-prey interactions between the two whale species and krill. Using historical catch data for blue and minke whales, a simple age-aggregated model including species interactions is fitted to survey abundance estimates. Uncertainties in the abundance estimates and the biological parameters are taken into account in the process by considering plausible ranges for their values. Abundance trends for the species can broadly be replicated by the model, provided the parameter values show certain features, including (i) that blue whales are able to maintain their birth and krill consumption rates until krill abundance drops to relatively low levels, and (ii) that both minke and blue whales show relatively fast rates of growth if krill is abundant, but that minke growth rate falls more rapidly as krill abundance drops. The model suggests two interesting features of the dynamics of these species. First, a substantial decrease in krill biomass from the 1970s to the 1990s as a result of the preceding rapid increase in minke whale abundance, and hence krill consumption, following the depletion of the larger baleen whales. Second, a recovery of blue whales despite the impact of minke whales on krill abundance and its resultant decrease, because blue whales are better able to tolerate decreased krill abundance. Future projections show a gradual increasing trend in blue whale abundance and a gradual decrease in minke abundance, with large amplitude oscillations superimposed. Long-term monitoring of biological parameters and abundance are essential to provide a basis for verification or otherwise of such predictions. Results presented here should be viewed qualitatively rather than quantitatively. However, for the future, refinement of the model structure and incorporation of age structure, data on some other major predator species that feed on krill and some spatial structure, is under consideration.",2-s2.0-9344248996

The relationships between the body length and weight of both krill species were exponentially correlated with no significant differences between the two species (p>0.05). The ratio between eye diameter and body length of individual krill was examined in an expectation that it could be used as an indicator of the body shrinkage as previously suggested by Shin and Nicol (2002). These ratios were significantly different between the two krill species. Especially, E. crystallorophias had bigger eyes than E. superba. In both krill species, eye diameters were highly correlated with body lengths (regression coefficients ≥ 0.70). For E. crystallorophias, no significant differences of the ratio of eye diameter/body length were detected between fall and winter. Even though the ratios for E. superba were seasonally varied, it was not clear whether body shrinkage was an actual and critical overwintering mechanism for the krill population found in this study area. These results suggest that some individuals of E. superba might experience the body shrinkage during a part of their life, but this morphological index alone (eye diameter/body length) may be insufficient to unambiguously separate the shrunk krill from the non-shrunk ones in the field-collected animals.",2-s2.0-12344280221

To this end, instantaneous growth rate experiments were conducted with larval and juvenile krill to determine growth increments and molting frequency in situ. All experiments were carried out during fall and winter months (April through September) on nine separate cruises west of the Antarctic Peninsula between 1987 and 1999. A consistent seasonal pattern across years was observed: growth rates decreased during fall (April/ May), were minimal in early winter (June), and increased to maximum rates by late winter (September). Habitat-specific differences (water column vs under-ice) in growth rates of larvae collected on the same cruise were not observed in early winter (June 1993; within-year comparison). However, in a between-year comparison, larvae from the under-ice habitat (June/July 1987) had significantly higher growth increments than larvae from the open-water habitat (July 1989). The difference between these two comparisons may be a function of the degree of contrast in food availability in the water column and the sea ice at different times in the winter. Daylength at the time of collection explained 74% of the variation in larval and juvenile growth rates. This correlation may be an indirect effect of the influence of diel cycles on krill behavior and/or primary production in both the water column and ice.",2-s2.0-0345099411

Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) and krill-dependent predators such as fish, seals, and birds are abundant there, and most krill fisheries have operated in this area since 1970s. The hottest issues for the proper management of krill resources nowadays are to determine total biomass in this area, and to identify environmental forces controlling stock fluctuation. This paper reviews and collates information on ongoing oceanographic activities in the Antarctic Peninsula region concerning these issues. To delineate the status and function of Antarctic krill population in Antarctic marine ecosystems, multinational researches along the Antarctic Peninsula area have been developing recently. Four member states of CCAMLR (Japan, Russia, UK, and USA) had conducted acoustic surveys in January-February 2000 (socalled CCAMLR-2000 survey), and krill standing stock at 120 kHz was estimated to be 44.29 million metric tonnes in the western Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean. On the other hand, the Southern Ocean GLOBEC (SO-GLOBEC) Programme has prepared a serial winter survey to examine the factors that govern krill survivorship and distribution in relation to shelf circulation processes. Ship-based surveys using ice-breakers are being conducted by three nations (Germany, UK, and USA) around the Marguerite Bay during the austral fall and winter 2001 and 2002. In addition to these two large-scale surveys, some CCAMLR members have carried out joint oceanographic surveys near the South Shetland Islands to detect ecosystem changes since 1994. Especially from December 1999 to February 2000, in conjunction with CCAMLR-2000 survey, four nations (Japan, Korea, Peru, and USA) conducted acoustic surveys to produce time-series information on krill distribution and biomass near the South Shetland areas. Though the aims of each program and the approach to solve the scientific questions were different each other, the results from each program fill the gaps between programs. Further cooperation and exchange in these activities could be beneficial to each program.",2-s2.0-0035735421

Euphausia superba structural lipids showed little mesoscale variability. Specific differences between phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine fatty acid composition exceeded variability related to sampling stations. On a larger scale (Southern Ocean), fatty acid composition of both total polar lipids and phosphatidylcholine confirmed the reduced level of regional variability. Similar comparisons between female M. norvegica collected at two extreme sites in terms of temperature regime (Kattegat and Ligurian Sea) during two seasons (spring-summer and fall-winter) suggested a more complex picture. Levels of phosphatidylethanolamine, lysophosphatidylcholine, and diphosphatidylglycerol showed significant differences between sites. During spring-summer, a lower content of phosphatidylethanolamine and lysophosphatidylcholine was observed for the Ligurian Sea population.

The biomass estimates fall between 60 and 155 million tonnes -at the low end of values that have been suggested in the past. The differences between our estimates and others can be explained by a number of factors such as: an underestimation of the range or the acoustic biomass estimates; the possibility of a large, undetected krill population; and the overestimation of the demand for krill by predators. Even if these low krill biomass estimates are correct, regional and total precautionary limits are still likely to rise as a result of new surveys because the method used to calculate precautionary limits uses a value of 11% of the estimated pre-exploitation biomass. Additionally, the current precautionary catch limits in the South Atlantic are set using a superseded acoustic target strength which has effectively underestimated the krill biomass by a factor of three, so the new survey of the South Atlantic in January 2000 may result in an effective biomass which is greater than the value used in the past. The seasonal and local consequences of large catch limits will have to be taken into account when managing an expanded krill fishery, and the appropriateness of using the existing statistical divisions as management areas will have to be considered.",2-s2.0-0000566818

Analyses of acoustic observations revealed distinct seasonal variations in estimates of krill abundance, the dimensional parameters used to characterize individual krill aggregations, the geographic area over which krill were acoustically detected, and the depth distribution of krill biomass. Spatially averaged estimates of krill biomass were an order of magnitude higher in spring (32 gm-2) and summer (95 gm-2) compared to fall (12 g m-2) and winter (8 g m-2). In summer, krill were detected throughout the region and most of the krill biomass was associated with aggregations of small cross-sectional area (&lt; 2000 m2) and high mean biomass (&gt; 150 gm-3), which were positioned in the upper 50 m of the water column.

Here, we present a new method for examining such interactions using the results from an acoustic survey of krill availability to foraging penguins. Analyses of fine-scale krill distributions within a 1852 x 1852 x 50 m volume of ocean revealed substantial prey patchiness in all dimensions. Our survey detected the presence of at least 6 krill aggregations in the survey area. The surface distribution of penguins was associated with the edges of these aggregations and was non-randomly associated with krill densities above 0.1 krill m-3 in the 30 to 40 m depth layer. The latter association was masked when krill abundance was integrated over the entire water column. Given that mean daytime olive depths for chinstrap penguins fall between 30 and 40 m, our data suggest penguins may fail to detect or choose to pass by shallow, denser prey aggregations and successfully forage on deeper, more homogeneously distributed krill offering higher encounter probabilities per unit volume searched. These findings reveal biologically important features of prey patchiness that cannot be addressed within the limitations of a primarily 2-dimensional analysis of predator-prey distributions.

A time series (1975/76-1986/87) for several subareas of the Antarctic Peninsula-Bellingshausen Sea area indicates considerable variation in the krill spawning start, maxima and completion. In particular years (1975/76, 1980/81), krill spawning in the western Atlantic sector began relatively early, was intensive, and completed early. Some years (1977/78, 1981/82) were characterised by long and non-synchronised krill spawning.

In relation to spawning timing variation, the habitats of the krill population fall into five categories: (1) areas with an early beginning (late Novemberearly December) and a variable, but normally long, duration (3-3.5 months) of krill spawning; this is generally the southern boundary of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current, (2) areas with an early beginning, but a short duration of krill spawning (Gerlache Strait), (3) areas with a highly variable (within 1-1.5 months) beginning and a relatively long duration (ca. 3 months) of krill spawning (Bransfield Strait, Palmer Archipelago), (4) areas with a late beginning (late December-January) and a long duration of krill spawning (Bellingshausen Sea, D'Urville Sea, and Balleny Islands area), and (5) areas with a delayed beginning, but a very short duration (ca. 1.5 months) of krill spawning (Ross Sea slope, probably the Coastal Current area off the Lasarev Sea shelf and in the south-eastern Weddell Sea.

Seasonal feeding was examined from 1977/1978 (November-March). The diel feeding cycle was investigated during a 96 h station established in February 1976, while food selection was analyzed using larvae and zooplankton samples collected in February 1982. Hatching occurs in early spring, and larvae fed on eggs of calanoid copepods and on cyclopoid copepods. Copepod eggs were the principal food near the pack ice, and cyclopoids in open waters. Cyclopoids were the staple food in summer. Eggs of the Antarctic krill Euphausia superba were ingested selectively and formed major portions of the larval summer diet in neritic (Joinville Island) and oceanic (Elephant Island) spawning areas of E. superba. In the fall, copepods predominated in the diets. Most abundant and most frequently ingested prey in summer and fall were Oncaea spp. Feeding commenced at dawn and continued at least until dusk. Krill eggs were taken chiefly during morning hours and egg incidence declined during the day, suggesting that eggs were ingested soon after spawning. Prey size at the onset of feeding was estimated as 0.130 to 0.330 mm. Size-selective feeding was evident in small larvae, while in larger larvae median prey length remained constant. High feeding incidence among yolk-sac larvae in spring, high overall feeding incidence in summer, and size-selective foraging of small larvae suggested favorable feeding conditions in the 1977/1978 season. Yolk-absorption times in Antarctic fish larvae vary on a scale of weeks and may be further retarded due to early feeding. Hence, year-to-year variability of yolk incidence in N. larseni indicated variable biotic environments of early feeding larvae rather than temporal shifts of hatching periods. As hatching periods are constant between years in contrast to the variable retreat of the pack ice and subsequent onset of the production cycle in space and time, maternal yolk reserves are probably utilized to compensate for such variations. © 1990 Springer-Verlag.",2-s2.0-0025143853

Water, ash, carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus composition were also determined. Compared with summer data, body composition of E. superba at this time of year was characterized by low carbon (40.2 to 40.7% of total dry wt), high nitrogen (11.8 to 12.0%), high phosphorus (1.2%) and high water (80.6 to 81.7% of total wet wt) content. Metabolic rates, expressed as percentage daily losses of body carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus were 1.3 to 1.6%, 0.38 to 0.42% and 1.9 to 2.2%, respectively; these fall within the ranges of summer data. E. superba fed on algae growing on the bottom of the ice, but body compositional features of this species suggest limited contribution of ice-algae to nutrition. Compared to E. superba, E. crystallorophias displayed greater metabolic rates and much higher body carbon content (40.9 to 45.0%), implying that feeding conditions under the ice were better suited to the requirements of E. crystallorophias. The only gravid females found belonged to E. crystallorophias. © 1989 Springer-Verlag.",2-s2.0-0000700030

The most numerous species (&gt;1000/100 m3) were the copepods Metridia gerlachei, Microcalanus pygmaeus, Oncaea antarctica and Oncaea curvata. Oncaea curvata alone constituted half the zooplakton population. Zooplankton biomass was dominated by three copepod species, Metridia gerlachei, Calanoides aculus and Euchaeta antarctica,which comprised 74% of the biomass. Size analysis revealed most of the zooplankton numbers were in the &gt;1 mm fraction. The biomass distribution was polymodal with major maxima in the &gt;1 mm and the 4-4.9 mm size classe. The &gt;1 mm peak, exclusive of protozoans, was primarily copepod nauplii and copepodites of Oncaea, Metridia and Microcalanus. The 4-4.9 mm peak was mostly Calanoides acutus and Metridia gerlachei. All of the principal species had broad vertical distributions both day and night. There was some suggestion of diel vertial migration by Metridia gerlachei and Euchaeta antarctica, with segments of their populations migrating into the upper 100 m and 200 m, respectively, at night. Most of the dominant and subdominant species were concentrated below 200 m,with only the subdominant Oithona similis having its maximum in the epipelagic zone. The occurrence of zooplankton at winter depths appears to have been earlier in Croker Passage in 1983 than has been generally reported for waters south of the Polar Front. Total standing stock of net-caught zooplankton (&gt;15 mm) in the upper 1000 m was estimated at 3.1 gDW/m2, which is somewhat higher than values reported for the West Wind Drift and for open ocean areas of temperate to tropical latitudes. Euphausia superba (17-52 mm) dominated the pelagic biomass, exceeding zooplankton standing stock under a square meter of ocean by a factor of 15. This is in contrast to lower latitudes where zooplankton biomass is usually greater than macrozooplankton-micronekton. © 1985 Springer-Verlag.",2-s2.0-0000440264

In this paper, a new agitation method is proposed for the practical expansion of the same treatment. These two could fall into the one category of turbulence methods, Antarctic krill in water were processed by turbulence caused either by a water jet or by agitation, and were exposed to various types of strong and weak forces: compressive, tensile, shearing, and impulsive. After repeated strong attacks, more than 50 times, de-carapace resulted. The term fatigue destruction, which is used in mechanical engineering, was introduced to explain this phenomenon. Tests were carried out on trawlers and in our laboratory for 2 years, using bench scale experimental apparatus: a 2-l vessel in the case of water jet and a 50-l vessel in the case of agitation. When fresh krills were used as samples, more than 80% of the krills were successfully processed in both treatments. The object was products which are satisfactorily de-carapaced without damage to their meat. © 1982, The Japanese Society of Fisheries Science. All rights reserved.",2-s2.0-85008016643

There is also a relative increase in the proportion of lipid with increase in body weight, and conversely a fall in protein, and to some extent of carbohydrate, with increasing body size. Whereas in smaller krill protein is the largest fraction, in large specimens of Euphausia superba protein and lipid are virtually identical in amount. Carbohydrate is always the smallest of the three biochemical fractions. Analysis of the amino acid composition of protein hydrolysates of freeze dried material gave very similar results to those formerly obtained from deep frozen material. © 1974, Marine Biological Association of the United Kingdom.
