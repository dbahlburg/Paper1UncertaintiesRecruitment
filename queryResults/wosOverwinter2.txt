In this coastal system, non-living particulates and CDOM carried by the freshwater run-off of the St Lawrence River and several large rivers have a strong impact on turbidity and light attenuance in the surface layer. The WMD of T. raschii and M. norvegica were significantly and positively related to surface salinity. However, M. norvegica was found deeper and in warmer water than T. raschii, and the latter had a steeper response to surface salinity. The species-specific relationships between daytime WMD and surface salinity enabled us to estimate both species regional and interannual variations in summertime temperature habitat during a 21-year period (1991-2011). The variability in daytime WMD resulted in significant inter- and intraspecific differences in the temperature experienced by adult krill that may impact development, growth, and reproduction. Our study illustrated the importance of considering species-specific responses to environmental forcing in coupled biophysical models that aim to explore the impacts of environmental variations on krill dynamics.

J	Nicol, S; Brierley, AS				Nicol, Stephen; Brierley, Andrew S.			Through a glass less darkly-New approaches for studying the distribution, abundance and biology of Euphausiids	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY												Euphausiids are vital components of many oceanic foodwebs. Due to their large size, they are key prey species for many vertebrates, and several species are subject to commercial fisheries. The best studied euphausiid species is Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba), and a considerable literature exists documenting its ecology. The abundance of Antarctic krill varies enormously over multiple time and space scales in the Southern Ocean. This variability is driven partly by physical processes, but also by the behaviour of the animals as individuals and as groups. It is likely that such variability also affects the populations of other large euphausiid species. In order to understand this variability, particularly in the context of rapid environmental change and expanding fisheries interests, we need to shift emphasis from conventional point- and transect-sampling conducted from brief research cruises usually in summer to basin-scale observations over extended time periods. Future studies of the large-scale biology of krill of all species will also need to consider how their growth, reproduction and behaviour might alter in response to predicted environmental changes such as decline in sea ice cover, rising temperature and acidification of the ocean. Paradoxically, to answer many outstanding questions in krill biology, there also needs to be a shift towards examining the three-dimensional dynamics of krill aggregations on very small space and timescales. This paper outlines some of the approaches that might enable us to make progress in understanding these key organisms at multiple spatial and temporal scales, approaches that in turn may leave us better able to manage krill populations into the future. Whilst the paper's focus is primarily on Antarctic krill, the findings are applicable generally to other large, schooling euphausiid species. Crown Copyright (C) 2009 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

A single team of 16 dogs received 8% krill meal for 5 weeks prior to the start of race, while another team of 16 dogs received no supplementation. Ten dogs of the treatment and 11 dogs of the control group finished the race and their blood was analyzed for omega-3 index, inflammation (CRP) and muscle damage (CK). The omega-3 index of the krill meal-fed dogs was significantly higher at the beginning of the race (mean 6.2% in the supplemented vs 5.2% in the control group, p < .001). CRP concentrations increased from 7.05 +/- 2.27 to 37.04 +/- 9.16 mu g/ml in the control and from 4.26 +/- 0.69 to 16.56 +/- 3.03 mu g/ml in the treatment group, with a significant difference between the groups (p < .001). CK activity was increased from 90.75 +/- 8.15 IU/1 to 715.90 +/- 218.9 IU/1 in the control group and from 99.55 +/- 12.15 to 515.69 +/- 98.98 in the supplemented group, but there were no differences between groups (p = .266). The results showed that krill meal supplementation led to significantly higher omega-3 index, which correlated with lower inflammation and a tendency for reduced muscle damage after this long-distance sled dog competition. However, these results need to be confirmed by more controlled studies, since it was a field study and effects of race speed or other performance related factors such as fitness and musher skill on the results cannot be excluded.

A response to Hill et al	JOURNAL OF CRUSTACEAN BIOLOGY												A commentary by Hill et al. (2019) raised some questions concerning the analyses of trends in krill density presented in Cox et al. (2018). We have re-examined our analyses and conclude that our approach does not contain multiple errors as asserted by Hill et al. (2019). Specifically, we reiterate that our statistical analysis of the publicly available version of KRILLBASE does not support the notion of a precipitous decline in krill density between 1976 and 2016. We respond to the technical criticisms made by Hill et al. (2019) of our work. We include a section where we suggest some approaches to help build consensus on detecting ecological trends in the Southern Ocean in the future. These approaches include: integrated assessments incorporating all relevant data, utilising data that will become available in the future from emerging technologies, and suggestions of other potential population monitoring methods that may be effective for krill.																	0278-0372	1937-240X				MAY	2019	39	3					323	327		10.1093/jcbiol/ruz010							WOS:000469782300015

FM is mostly produced from mass-caught pelagic species, but the production has been relatively constant for several decades. The aim of this study was to investigate the potential of dietary krill meal (KM) inclusion as a sustainable alternative to FM. In view of that, a feeding trial with gilthead seabream juveniles was conducted to evaluate whether dietary KM at 3%, 6% and 9% inclusion improves growth performance in comparison with a control diet. At the end of the study, fish in the 9% KM group showed significantly higher body weight (32.76 g) compared with fish fed the control diet (30.30 g). Moreover, FM replacement by 9% KM indicated a reduction in the accumulation of lipid droplets in the hepatocytes and around the pancreatic islets. In summary, this study suggests that FM can be reduced in diets for seabream without negatively affecting growth performance, when KM is added. On the contrary, KM enhances gilthead seabream growth and reduces lipid accumulation and damage of hepatocytes, which will open an interesting innovation line to completely replace FM by alternative terrestrial protein sources and the partial inclusion of KM.

This article reviews current and expected changes in ASO physical habitats in response to climate change. It then reviews how these changes may impact the autecology of marine biota of this polar region: microbes, zooplankton, salps, Antarctic krill, fish, cephalopods, marine mammals, seabirds, and benthos. The general prognosis for ASO marine habitats is for an overall warming and freshening, strengthening of westerly winds, with a potential pole-ward movement of those winds and the frontal systems, and an increase in ocean eddy activity. Many habitat parameters will have regionally specific changes, particularly relating to sea ice characteristics and seasonal dynamics. Lower trophic levels are expected to move south as the ocean conditions in which they are currently found move pole-ward. For Antarctic krill and finfish, the latitudinal breadth of their range will depend on their tolerance of warming oceans and changes to productivity. Ocean acidification is a concern not only for calcifying organisms but also for crustaceans such as Antarctic krill; it is also likely to be the most important change in benthic habitats over the coming century. For marine mammals and birds, the expected changes primarily relate to their flexibility in moving to alternative locations for food and the energetic cost of longer or more complex foraging trips for those that are bound to breeding colonies. Few species are sufficiently well studied to make comprehensive species-specific vulnerability assessments possible. Priorities for future work are discussed.

Capturing foraging and resting behavior using nested multivariate Markov models in an air-breathing marine vertebrate	MOVEMENT ECOLOGY												Background: Matching animal movement with the behaviors that shape life history requires a rigorous connection between the observed patterns of space use and inferred behavioral states. As animal-borne dataloggers capture a greater diversity and frequency of three dimensional movements, we can increase the complexity of movement models describing animal behavior. One challenge in combining data streams is the different spatial and temporal frequency of observations. Nested movement models provide a flexible framework for gleaning data from long-duration, but temporally sparse, data sources. Results: Using a two-layer nested model, we combined geographic and vertical movement to infer traveling, foraging and resting behaviors of Humpback whales off the West Antarctic Peninsula. This approach refined previous work using only geographic data to delineate coarser behavioral states. Our results showed increased intensity in foraging activity in late season animals as the whales prepared to migrate north to tropical calving grounds. Our model also suggests strong diel variation in movement states, likely linked to daily changes in prey distribution. Conclusions: Using a combination of two-dimensional and three-dimensional movement data, we highlight the connection between whale movement and krill availability, as well as the complex spatial pattern of whale foraging in productive polar waters.

Using habitat models for chinstrap penguins Pygoscelis antarctica to advise krill fisheries management during the penguin breeding season	DIVERSITY AND DISTRIBUTIONS												Aim To predict the at-sea distribution of chinstrap penguins across the South Orkney Islands and to quantify the overlap with the Southern Ocean krill fishery. Location Methods South Orkney Islands, Antarctica. Penguins from four colonies across the South Orkney Islands were tracked using global positioning systems (GPSs) and time depth recorders (TDRs). Relationships between a variety of environmental and geometric variables and the at-sea distribution of penguins were investigated using general additive models for the three main phases of the breeding season. Subsequently, the final models were extrapolated across the South Orkney archipelago to predict the at-sea distribution of penguins from colonies where no tracking data are available. Finally, the overlap between areas used by chinstrap penguins and the krill fishery was quantified. Results Main conclusions The foraging distribution of chinstrap penguins can be predicted using two simple and static variables: the distance from the colony and the direction of travel towards the shelf-edge, while avoiding high densities of Pygoscelis penguins from other colonies. Additionally, we find that the chinstrap penguins breeding on the South Orkney Islands use areas which overlap with frequently used krill fishing areas and that this overlap is most prominent during the brood and creche phases of the breeding season. This is the first step in understanding the potential impacts of the krill fishery, for all colonies including those where no empirical tracking data are available. However, with the available data, it is not currently possible to infer an impact of the krill fisheries on penguins. With this in mind, we recommend the implementation of monitoring schemes to investigate the effects of prey depletion on predator populations and to ensure that management continues to follow a precautionary approach and is addressed at spatial and temporal scales relevant to ecosystem operation.

Sardines, anchovy, and Antarctic krill are suggested examples, and here we use locusts to explore whether the wasp-waist concept also applies on land. These examples also display the traits of mobile aggregations and dietary diversity, which help to reduce the foraging footprint from their large, localised biomasses. This suggests that top-down control on their food operates at local aggregation scales and not at wider scales suggested by the original definition of wasp-waist. With this modification, the wasp-waist framework can cross-fertilise marine and terrestrial approaches, revealing how seemingly disparate but economically important systems operate.

Modelling Southern Ocean ecosystems: krill, the food-web, and the impacts of harvesting	BIOLOGICAL REVIEWS												The ecosystem approach to fisheries recognises the interdependence between harvested species and other ecosystem components. It alms to account for the propagation of the effects of harvesting through the food-web. The formulation and evaluation of ecosystem-based management strategies requires reliable models of ecosystem dynamics to predict these effects. The krill-based system in the Southern Ocean was the focus of some of the earliest models exploring such effects. It is also a suitable example for the development of models to support the ecosystem approach to fisheries because it ha a relatively simple food-web structure and progress has been made in developing models of the key species and interactions, some of which has been motivated by the need to develop ecosystem-based management. Antarctic krill, Euphausia superba, is the main target species for the fishery and the main prey of many top predators. It is therefore critical to capture the processes affecting the dynamics and distribution of krill in ecosystem dynamics models. These processes include environmental influences on recruitment and the spatially variable influence of advection. Models must also capture the interactions between krill and its consumers, which are mediated by the spatial structure of the environment. Various models have explored predator-prey population dynamics with simplistic representations of these interactions, while others have focused on specific details of the interactions. There is now a pressing need to develop plausible and practical models of ecosystem dynamics that link processes occurring at these different scales. Many studies have highlighted uncertainties in our understanding of the system, which indicates future priorities in terms of both data collection and developing methods to evaluate the effects of these uncertainties on model predictions. We propose a modelling approach that focuses on harvested species and their monitored consumers and that evaluates model uncertainty by using alternative structures and functional forms in a Monte Carlo framework.

Dietary intakes are fundamental to provide neonates with adequate DHA supply; hence, maternal supplementation might represent a useful strategy to implement DHA contents in breast milk (BM), with possible benefits on neonatal neurodevelopment. Antarctic krill is a small crustacean rich in highly available phospholipid-bound DHA. This pilot study aimed to evaluate whether maternal supplementation with krill oil during breastfeeding increases long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFAs) BM contents. Methods: Mothers of infants admitted to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit were enrolled in this open, randomized-controlled study between 4 and 6 weeks after delivery and randomly allocated in 2 groups. Group 1 received an oral krill oil-based supplement providing 250mg/day of DHA and 70mg/day of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) for 30 days; group 2 served as control. BM samples from both groups were collected at baseline (T0) and day 30 (T1) and underwent a qualitative analysis of LCPUFAs composition by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. Results: Sixteen breastfeeding women were included. Of these, 8 received krill-oil supplementation and 8 were randomized to the control group. Baseline percentage values of DHA (% DHA), arachidonic acid (% AA), and EPA (% EPA) did not differ between groups. A significant increase in % DHA (T0: median 0.23% [IQR 0.19; 0.38], T1: 0.42%[0.32; 0.49], p 0.012) and% EPA (T0: median 0.10%[IQR 0.04; 0.11], T1: 0.11% [0.04; 0.15], p 0.036) and a significant reduction in % AA (T0: median 0.48% [IQR 0.42; 0.75], T1: 0.43% [0.38; 0.61], p 0.017) between T0 and T1 occurred in Group 1, whereas no difference was seen in Group 2. Consistently, a significant between-group difference was observed in percentage changes from baseline of DHA (Delta% DHA, group 1: median 64.2% [IQR 27.5; 134.6], group 2: -7.8% [-12.1;-3.13], p 0.025) and EPA (Delta% EPA, group 1: median 39% [IQR 15.7; 73.4]; group 2: -25.62% [-32.7;-3.4], p 0.035). Conclusions: Oral krill oil supplementation effectively increases DHA and EPA contents in BM. Potential benefits of this strategy on brain and visual development in breastfed preterm neonates deserve further evaluation in targeted studies.

Spatial organization of krill and seabirds in the central California Current	ICES JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE												The hypothesis that krill and krill-predator spatial organization and abundance co-vary interannually was tested by investigating the spatial organization of krill and planktivorous seabirds in the central California Current ecosystem over 5 years of varying oceanographic conditions, 2002-2006. To measure the abundance and distribution of krill, data were integrated from large-scale hydroacoustic surveys and station-based net samples, and these data linked to concurrent shipboard visual surveys of seabirds. Acoustically based estimates of the relative abundance of krill were correlated with net samples of Euphausia pacifica, suggesting that acoustic signals mainly reflected the distribution of this numerically dominant species. The distribution and abundance of krill displayed marked changes over years, but the characteristic spatial scale of krill and seabirds remained similar (1-4 nautical miles), confirming the hypothesis of covariance in spatial structure. Krill and the seabird species investigated showed similar habitat associations, i.e. the outer shelf and shelf-slope region, showing that the at-sea distributions of seabirds can provide information on the presence/absence of krill patches. The results also underscore the importance of measuring spatial organization as well as relative abundance in promoting better understanding of predator-prey and marine ecosystem dynamics.																	1054-3139	1095-9289				JUL	2011	68	7					1391	1402		10.1093/icesjms/fsr046							WOS:000294167800003

It analysed faecal samples from five consecutive years (1997-2001) and length distribution of krill taken by trawl nets in the vicinity of Livingston Island. Antarctic krill, Euphausia superba, was the most frequent prey item, followed by several myctophid species (Gymnoscopelus nicholsi, Electrona antarctica and Electrona carlsbergi), squid and penguin remains. From 1998 to 2001, a modal progression in krill size was evident, suggesting that A. gazella was depending on a strong krill cohort, at least over the study period. Analysis of size distribution and size selectivity of krill preyed upon by fur seals suggests a preference for larger krill (>34 mm), despite the broader size range of preys items available.

Effects of partial or total replacement of fish meal with freeze-dried krill (Euphausia superba) on growth and nutrient utilization of juvenile Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) and Atlantic halibut (Hippoglossus hippoglossus) fed the same practical diets	AQUACULTURE NUTRITION												Studies were conducted with juvenile (28 g) Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) and halibut (Hippoglossus hippoglossus) fed fish meal (FM) based diets with partial (0%, 25%, 50% and 75%) or total (100%) replacement of FM with freeze-dried krill (FDK). Addition of dietary FDK significantly stimulated feeding activity in both species and resulted in higher feed consumption and intakes of digestible protein (DP) and energy (DE). This is a significant finding on the feed attractant properties of FDK because it occurred despite having 2-4 MJ kg(-1) higher levels of DE in the FDK diets which could have had an intake suppression effect. In addition, it indicates that the soluble protein fraction of krill thought to be responsible for its attractant properties and is routinely lost or greatly reduced during commercial processing of krill meals, is retained by freeze-drying. Supplementation of FDK significantly improved growth rates, digestibility and nutrient utilization. Levels exceeding 25-50% FM replacement, however, generally did not significantly increase growth performance or nutrient utilization. In addition, feed formulations with high FDK (> 75% replacement) are likely to be cost-prohibitive as long as the market price remains higher than FM.

J	Willis, J				Willis, Jay			Could whales have maintained a high abundance of krill?	EVOLUTIONARY ECOLOGY RESEARCH												Question: Several million large whales were killed between 1900 and 1970. All these whales preyed on krill (Euphausia superba). Why has krill population abundance declined after the elimination of their primary predator? Hypothesis: Krill have changed their behaviour due to the absence of whales and this change in behaviour has resulted in a decrease in krill abundance. Methods: I reproduced a computer model of krill life history. I then extended the model as an individual-based model to show the effects of habitat choice on individual lifetime reproductive success and abundance. Conclusions: In the context of our current understanding of krill physiology, predator-invoked behaviour may lead to increased population abundance and, without the predator, natural selection may favour behaviour that would lead to lower abundance. This reverses the predictions of mass balance ecosystem models.					Willis, Jay/0000-0003-0701-7262												1522-0613					MAY	2007	9	4					651	662									WOS:000247437000006

Fifty-three foraging trips from 49 penguins indicated that during December 1991 and January 1992 the temperature in the top 100 m of the water column was highest in the western section of the Bay which concurred with higher krill abundance as determined by a catch per unit effort index. This work demonstrates that abiotic and biotic features of the environment can be studied using animals to transport probes to the study site, provided information is given on the position of the animals when measurements are made.																	0171-8630					MAR	1994	106	1-2					199	202		10.3354/meps106199							WOS:A1994NB76600018

Two microwave (MW) acid assisted digestion methods (with HNO3/H2O2 and HNO3/HF) were tested to mineralize the certified reference material MURST-ISS-A2, Antarctic Krill. The effect of power and time parameters was tested to investigate the influence of the matrix on analyte recovery. The use of the mixture of Pd and Mg(NO3)(2) as the m-matrix modifier in the ETAAS determination increased the thermal stabilization of Cd and Pb significantly. The detection limits ranged between 3 and 35 ng g(-1) and the dynamic range of the method spared one order of magnitude. The precision was better than 5% in all cases when peak area absorbance was used. The results obtained were in good agreement with the certified values.																	0195-5373	2708-521X				JUL-AUG	2001	22	4					350	355									WOS:000171404900005

Blocking primers to enhance PCR amplification of rare sequences in mixed samples - a case study on prey DNA in Antarctic krill stomachs	FRONTIERS IN ZOOLOGY												Background: Identification of DNA sequence diversity is a powerful means for assessing the species present in environmental samples. The most common molecular strategies for estimating taxonomic composition depend upon PCR with universal primers that amplify an orthologous DNA region from a range of species. The diversity of sequences within a sample that can be detected by universal primers is often compromised by high concentrations of some DNA templates. If the DNA within the sample contains a small number of sequences in relatively high concentrations, then less concentrated sequences are often not amplified because the PCR favours the dominant DNA types. This is a particular problem in molecular diet studies, where predator DNA is often present in great excess of food-derived DNA. Results: We have developed a strategy where a universal PCR simultaneously amplifies DNA from food items present in DNA purified from stomach samples, while the predator's own DNA is blocked from amplification by the addition of a modified predator-specific blocking primer. Three different types of modified primers were tested out; one annealing inhibiting primer overlapping with the 3' end of one of the universal primers, another annealing inhibiting primer also having an internal modification of five dI molecules making it a dual priming oligo, and a third elongation arrest primer located between the two universal primers. All blocking primers were modified with a C3 spacer. In artificial PCR mixtures, annealing inhibiting primers proved to be the most efficient ones and this method reduced predator amplicons to undetectable levels even when predator template was present in 1000 fold excess of the prey template. The prey template then showed strong PCR amplification where none was detectable without the addition of blocking primer. Our method was applied to identifying the winter food of one of the most abundant animals in the world, the Antarctic krill, Euphausia superba. Dietary item DNA was PCR amplified from a range of species in krill stomachs for which we had no prior sequence knowledge. Conclusion: We present a simple, robust and cheap method that is easily adaptable to many situations where a rare DNA template is to be PCR amplified in the presence of a higher concentration template with identical PCR primer binding sites.

J	Hill, SL; Matthews, J				Hill, S. L.; Matthews, J.			THE SENSITIVITY OF MULTIPLE OUTPUT STATISTICS TO INPUT PARAMETERS IN A KRILL-PREDATOR-FISHERY ECOSYSTEM DYNAMICS MODEL	CCAMLR SCIENCE												There is a global need to develop strategic frameworks for assessing uncertainty in ecosystem dynamics models. Such models have been used within CCAMLR to evaluate options for managing the Antarctic krill fishery in the Scotia Sea and southern Drake Passage. The model analysed here required 2 311 input values for each of four scenarios and produced 68 output statistics. Small perturbations to input values affected output statistics indicating the status of predator groups more than they affected statistics indicating the status of the target stock or the fishery. Output statistics were most sensitive to a parameter controlling predator recruitment through pre-recruit mortality. A parameter mediating the effect of a forcing function on krill recruitment, which was used to condition the model on past dynamics, was also important, and some of the parameter estimates resulting from conditioning were unstable. This highlights the tension between the parameter stability benefits of well-constrained models and the use of model conditioning to identify plausible alternative hypotheses in data-poor situations. Apparent sensitivity is a function of both input values and output statistics. Clearer specification of ecosystem-based management objectives would help to identify the important statistics for consideration when assessing uncertainty in ecosystem dynamics models.

J	Mori, Y; Boyd, IL				Mori, Y; Boyd, IL			The behavioral basis for nonlinear functional responses and optimal foraging in antarctic fur seals	ECOLOGY												This study investigated the degree to which the behavior of a predator in the marine environment can be used to indicate the availability of prey. It examined this in Antarctic fur seals (Arctocephalus gazella) feeding on krill, with a view to understanding how behavioral choices could lead to a nonlinear functional response. The study showed how fur seals adjusted their time budgets to maximize the mean rate of energy intake in response to varying prey abundance. The behavioral indicator of prey abundance was the amount of time spent by fur seals at the bottom of dives after adjustment for dive depth. This indicator was well correlated with independent measures of prey abundance. The indicator was calibrated in terms of net rate of energy intake from information about energy expenditures in Antarctic fur seals and was used within the framework of optimal foraging theory to examine how female fur seals organized their foraging activity within and between bouts. Foraging in Antarctic fur seals conformed to many of the predictions from energy rate-maximizing behavior. For example, the apparent net rate of energy intake by fur seals declined with time spent in a patch, and the rate of energy intake on leaving a patch declined as apparent food availability in the environment declined. In addition, the time spent in patches increased as apparent food availability declined. Antarctic fur seals were able to adjust their behavior to track highly variable prey distributions and densities. The simple decision about when to leave a patch in relation to current environmental prey availability appears to be responsible for allowing fur seals to maintain saturation of the foraging rate as food density declines.																	0012-9658	1939-9170				FEB	2004	85	2					398	410		10.1890/03-4005							WOS:000220108700011

Changes in population size, distribution and phenology of the breeding species as well as the appearance of non-breeding species are reported. A total of 34 species of birds were observed, including 13 breeding species. Among the non-breeding species, four were observed to visit the site regularly, six rarely, and the remaining LI were observed only occasionally. Among breeding populations, three Pygoscelis penguin species, the main krill consumers, were most numerous. The Adelie Penguin (P. adeliae) dominated among the penguins nesting in the investigated areas, reaching 23,661 breeding pairs in 1978. Two other penguin species were less abundant with population sizes of approximately 7,200 breeding pairs for the Chinstrap Penguin (P. antarcticus) and 3,100 breeding pairs for the Gentoo Penguin (P. papua) in the same year. During the following two decades, breeding populations of pygoscelid species experienced a declining trend and their numbers were reduced by 68.0% for Chinstrap, 67.1% for Gentoo, and 33.9% for Adelie Penguins. The data reported here represent a unique reference basis and provide valuable information about indicator species, suitable for comparison with contemporary observations of bird populations in the Antarctic Peninsula region, a place of rapidly occurring climate changes and intensive harvesting of marine living resources.

Understanding these patterns of movement is important for informing marine ecosystem management and for understanding ecological processes generally. Retention of biological particles in a particular area due to ocean currents has received less attention than transport pathways, particularly for the Southern Ocean. We present a method for modelling retention time, based on the half-life for particles in a particular region, that is relevant for biological processes. This method uses geostrophic velocities at the ocean surface, derived from 23 years of satellite altimetry data (1993-2016), to simulate the advection of passive particles during the Southern Hemisphere summer season (from December to March). We assess spatial patterns in the retention time of passive particles and evaluate the processes affecting these patterns for the Indian sector of the Southern Ocean. Our results indicate that the distribution of retention time is related to bathymetric features and the resulting ocean dynamics. Our analysis also reveals a moderate level of consistency between spatial patterns of retention time and observations of Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) distribution.

Nephrops are sold either whole, or as tails-only for the scampi trade. In the tailing process, the head (cephalothorax) is discarded as waste. A smaller crustacean species, the Antarctic krill Euphasia superba, represents an economically valuable industry, as its extractable oil is sold as a human dietary supplement. The aim of this study was to determine the amount and composition of the oil contained in discarded Nephrops heads and to compare its composition to the oil extracted from krill. Differences due to Geographical variation and seasonal patterns in the amount and composition of lipid were also noted. Results indicated that Nephrops head waste samples collected from more southern locations in Scotland (Clyde Sea area) contained higher levels of oil when compared to samples collected from northern locations in Iceland. Moreover, seasonal differences within the Clyde Sea area in Scotland were also observed, with oil extracted from Nephrops head waste peaking at around 11.5% during the summer months when larger and more mature females were caught by trawl. At this time of the year, the valuable fatty acids eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) accounted for around 23% of the total fatty acid content in oil extracted from Nephrops head waste. A seasonal effect on EPA content was found, with higher levels obtained in the summer, while no trend was found in DHA percentages. Finally, oil from Nephrops head waste contained a higher proportion of EPA and DHA than krill oil but these fatty acids were more abundantly linked to the neutral lipids rather to than polar lipids. The characterization of lipid that could be extracted from Nephrops head waste should be seen as a first step for the commercial use of a valuable resource currently wasted. This approach is extremely relevant given the current limited supply of EPA and DHA and changes in the Common Fisheries Policy.

These results support previous proposals that the Southern Ocean seabird community is characterised by an ice-associated assemblage and an open-water assemblage, with the species composition of the assemblages reflecting local (Antarctic-resident) breeding species, and the migratory routes and feeding areas of distant-breeding taxa, respectively. Physical environmental covariates such as sea-ice cover, distance to continental shelf and time of year influenced the distribution and abundance of seabirds observed, but the roles of these factors in the observed spatial and temporal patterns in seabird assemblages was confounded by the duration of the survey. Occurrence of a number of seabird taxa exhibited significant correlations with krill densities at one or two spatial scales, but only three taxa (Arctic tern, snow petrel and dark shearwaters, i.e. sooty and short-tailed shearwaters) showed significant correlations at a range of spatial scales. Dark shearwater abundances showed correlations with krill densities across the range of spatial scales examined. (C) 2010 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Given the spatial overlap in the distribution of these krill predators (particularly humpback whales) and their dependence on krill, the goals of this paper are to determine if the inter-annual community structure and relative abundance of baleen whales around Anvers Island is related to krill demography and abundance, and if the potential exists for inter-specific interactions between Adelie penguins and baleen. We use whale sightings and prey data from both net tows and Adelie penguin stomach samples to correlate the abundance of humpback whales with krill demography and abundance from 1993 to 2001. We find significant relationships between whale abundance and the size-frequency distribution of krill targeted by Adelie penguins, as well as the foraging success of Adelie penguins. These findings suggest both krill predators share common prey preferences in the upper portions of the water column around Anvers Island. These findings highlight the need for better knowledge of baleen whale foraging ecology and inter-specific interactions with penguins, as sea ice and krill populations around the Antarctic Peninsula are affected by rapid changes in climate.

Krill feeding on sediment in the Gulf of Maine (North Atlantic)	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												Krill are key members of many marine ecosystems, serving as a critical trophic link between microscopic organisms and large predators such as whales, fish, and seabirds. Krill feeding is thus important to ecosystem carbon cycling. Traditional approaches to determining in-situ krill feeding require a priori assumptions, and may have prey-type detection biases. We took a DNA-based approach to measuring in-situ feeding by northern krill Meganyctiphanes norvegica. The diversity of prey consumed by M. norvegica in situ was analyzed for 80 krill at 8 stations throughout the Gulf of Maine (North Atlantic) using peptide nucleic acid mediated polymerase chain reaction (PNA-PCR) clone library sequencing of 18S rDNA. Relative abundance of the 2 most common prey types was measured with quantitative PCR (qPCR) in the guts of 16 krill. The 245 prey sequences recovered from krill gut contents included copepods, salps, phytoplankton, and a poorly known organism found to be sediment associated. Calanus finmarchicus and the sediment-associated organism were found most commonly, at 7 and 8 stations, respectively, and their 18S rDNA was present in nearly equal quantities in individual krill guts. M. norvegica, like most krill, are typically considered planktivorous; thus krill feeding on sediment organisms represents an unrecognized pathway for carbon flow from the sediment to the pelagic. Calculations suggest that this unrecognized pathway could potentially bring over 100 000 t of carbon annually back into the Gulf of Maine pelagic ecosystem, equivalent to 4% of annual primary production, or the energy demands of 80% of the region's fin whale population.																	0171-8630	1616-1599					2012	455						157	172		10.3354/meps09632							WOS:000304607100011

We analyzed zooplankton diel vertical distribution patterns in a wide range of taxa along the Western Antarctic Peninsula (WAP) to assess if DVM occurs, and if so, what environmental controls modulate DVM in the austral summer. Zooplankton were collected during January and February in paired day-night, depth-stratified tows through the mesopelagic zone along the WAP from 2009-2017, as well as in day and night epipelagic net tows from 1993-2017. The copepod Metridia gerlachei, salp Salpa thompsoni, ptempod Limacina helicina antarctica, and ostracods consistently conducted DVM between the mesopelagic and epipelagic zones. Migration distance for M. gerlachei and ostracods decreased as photoperiod increased from 17 to 22 h daylight. The copepods Calanoides acutus and Rhincalanus gigas, as well as euphausiids Thysanoessa macrura and Euphausia crystallorophias, conducted shallow (mostly within the epipelagic zone) DVMs into the upper 50 m at night. Rhincalanus gigas, T. macrura, and L. h. antarctica DVM behavior was modulated by chlorophyll a concentration, mixed layer depth, and depth of the subsurface chlorophyll a maximum, respectively. Carnivorous and detritivorous taxa - including the calanoid copepod Paraeuchaeta antarctica, ostracods, chaetognaths, and Tomopteris spp. polychaetes - as well as seasonally migrating copepods, were most abundant in the mesopelagic zone regardless of the diel cycle. Paraeuchaeta antarctica underwent reverse DVM within the top 100 m. The impacts of Antarctic zooplankton summer DVM and the resident mesopelagic assemblage on carbon export should be better quantified.

J	Chu, D; Wiebe, PH				Chu, D; Wiebe, PH			Measurements of sound-speed and density contrasts of zooplankton in Antarctic waters	ICES JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE												Sound-speed and density contrasts (h and g, respectively), two important acoustic material properties, of live zooplankton were measured off the western Antarctic Peninsula during a Southern Ocean GLOBEC cruise conducted from 9 April to 21 May 2002. The work included in situ sound-speed contrast and shipboard density-contrast measurements. The temperature and pressure (depth) dependence of the sound-speed contrast of Euphausia superba and E. crystallorophias as well as that of some other zooplankton species were investigated. The size range of E. superba used in the measurements varied from about 20 mm to 57 mm, with mean length of 36.7 turn and standard deviation of 9.8 turn, which covered life stages from juvenile to adult. For E. superba, there was no statistically significant depth dependence, but there was a moderate dependence of sound-speed and density contrasts on the size of the animals. The measured sound-speed contrast varied between 1.018 and 1.044, with mean value 1.0279 and standard deviation 0.0084, while the measured density contrast varied between 1.007 and 1.036, with mean value 1.0241 and standard deviation 0.0082. For E. crystallorophias and Calanus there was a measurable depth dependence in sound-speed contrast. The in situ sound-speed contrasts for E. crystallorophias were 1.025 +/- 0.004 to 1.029 +/- 0.009. For Calanus, they were variable, with one set giving a value of 0.949 +/- 0.001 and the other giving 1.013 +/- 0.002. Shipboard measurements of other taxa/species also showed substantial variation in g and h. In general, values of g ranged from 0.9402 to 1.051 and h ranged from 0.949 to 1.096. The variation of the material properties is related to species, type, size, stage, and in some cases depth of occurrence. The uncertainty of the estimates of zooplankton biomass attributable to these variations in g and h can be quite large (more than 100 fold). Improvements in making biological inferences from acoustic data depend strongly on increased information about the material properties of zooplankton and the biological causes for their variation, as well as a knowledge of the species composition and abundance.

Samples were collected with Chinese krill trawler (codend mesh size 2cm) in the Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean from January to August 2016. Data on LWRs and the relationships between weight and standard length as well as weight and total length of those species were updated for the database of FishBase.

DVM depth and migration patterns depend on oceanographic conditions with respect to temperature, light and oxygen availability at depth, factors that are highly dependent on season in most marine regions. Here we introduce a global krill respiration ANN (artificial neural network) model including the effect of latitude (LAT), the day of the year (DoY), and the number of daylight hours (DLh), in addition to the basal variables that determine ectothermal oxygen consumption (temperature, body mass and depth). The newly implemented parameters link space and time in terms of season and photoperiod to krill respiration. The ANN model showed a better fit (r(2) = 0.780) when DLh and LAT were included, indicating a decrease in respiration with increasing LAT and decreasing DLh. We therefore propose DLh as a potential variable to consider when building physiological models for both hemispheres. For single Euphausiid species investigated in a large range of DLh and DoY, we also tested the standard respiration rate for seasonality with Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) and General Additive model (GAM). GAM successfully integrated DLh (r(2) = 0.563) and DoY (r(2) = 0.572) effects on respiration rates of the Antarctic krill, Euphausia superba, yielding the minimum metabolic activity in mid-June and the maximum at the end of December. We could not detect DLh or DoY effects in the North Pacific krill Euphausia pacifica, and our findings for the North Atlantic krill Meganyctiphanes norvegica remained inconclusive because of insufficient seasonal data coverage. We strongly encourage comparative respiration measurements of worldwide Euphausiid key species at different seasons to improve accuracy in ecosystem modeling. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Euphausiid distribution along the Western Antarctic Peninsula - Part A: Development of robust multi-frequency acoustic techniques to identify euphausiid aggregations and quantify euphausild size, abundance, and biomass	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY												Methods were refined and tested for identifying the aggregations of Antarctic euphausiids (Euphausia spp.) and then estimating euphausiid size, abundance, and biomass, based on multi-frequency acoustic survey data. A threshold level of volume backscattering strength for distinguishing euphausiid aggregations from other zooplankton was derived on the basis of published measurements of euphausiid visual acuity and estimates of the minimum density of animals over which an individual can maintain visual contact with its nearest neighbor. Differences in mean volume backscattering strength at 120 and 43 kHz further served to distinguish euphausiids from other sources of scattering. An inversion method was then developed to estimate simultaneously the mean length and density of euphausiids in these acoustically identified aggregations based on measurements of mean volume backscattering strength at four frequencies (43, 120, 200, and 420kHz). The methods were tested at certain locations within an acoustically surveyed continental shelf region in and around Marguerite Bay, west of the Antarctic Peninsula, where independent evidence was also available from net and video systems. Inversion results at these test sites were similar to net samples for estimated length, but acoustic estimates of euphausiid density exceeded those from nets by one to two orders of magnitude, likely due primarily to avoidance and to a lesser extent to differences in the volumes sampled by the two systems. In a companion study, these methods were applied to the full acoustic survey data in order to examine the distribution of euphausiids in relation to aspects of the physical and biological environment [Lawson, G.L., Wiebe, P.H., Ashjian, C.J., Stanton, T.K., 2008.

J	Nevitt, G; Reid, K; Trathan, P				Nevitt, G; Reid, K; Trathan, P			Testing olfactory foraging strategies in an Antarctic seabird assemblage	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY												Procellariiform seabirds (petrels, albatrosses and shearwaters) forage over thousands of square kilometres for patchily distributed prey resources. While these birds are known for their large olfactory bulbs and excellent sense of smell, how they use odour cues to locate prey patches in the vast ocean is not well understood. Here, we investigate species-specific responses to 3-methyl pyrazine in a sub-Antarctic species assemblage near South Georgia Island (54degrees00' S, 36degrees00' W). Pyrazines are scented compounds found in macerated Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba), a primary prey item for many seabird species in this region. To examine behavioural attraction to this odour, we presented birds with either scented or 'unscented' vegetable oil slicks at sea. As a positive control for our experiments, we also compared birds' responses to a general olfactory attractant, herring oil. Responses to pyrazine were both highly species specific and consistent with results from earlier studies investigating responses to crude krill extracts. For example, Cape petrels (Daption capense), giant petrels (Macronectes sp.) and white-chinned petrels (Procellaria aequinoctialis) were sighted at least 1.8-4 times as often at pyrazine-scented slicks than at control slicks. Black-browed albatrosses (Diomedea melanophris) were only sighted at pyrazine-scented slicks and never at control slicks. Wilson's storm-petrels (Oceanites oceanicus), black-bellied storm-petrels(Fregetta tropica), great shearwaters (Puffinus gravis) and prions (Pachyptila sp.) were sighted with equal frequency at control and pyrazine-scented slicks. As expected, responses to herring oil were more common. With the exception of great shearwaters (Puffinus gravis), each of these species was sighted up to five times as often at slicks scented with herring oil compared with control slicks. Together, the results support the hypothesis that Antarctic procellariiforms use species-specific foraging strategies that are inter-dependent and more complex than simply tracking prey by scent.																	0022-0949	1477-9145				SEP	2004	207	20					3537	3544		10.1242/jeb.01198							WOS:000224694300015	15339950

HCB and DDTs were prevalent contaminants in penguin eggs. The highest concentrations of Sigma HCHs (1.35 +/- 0.72 ng/g) were found in the rockcod muscle, where gamma-HCH (1.23 +/- 0.67 ng/g) was the principal isomer. The ratio gamma-HCH/alpha-HCH was evaluated. Enantioselective gas chromatography was used for the evaluation of enantiomeric fractions (EFs) for alpha-HCH and oxychlordane. An increase of 14% in the (+)alpha-HCH enantiomer was found from krill through penguin, suggesting the enantioselective biotrasforrnation increased proportionately with trophic level. Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) were measured and their concentrations were 5.6 +/- 1.12, 5.81 +/- 2.32, 4.57 +/- 0.17 and 3.06 +/- 3.27 ng/g lipids in krill, rockcod muscle, rockcod homogenate and penguin eggs, respectively. The detection of BDE28, BDE47, BDE99 and BDE100 in Antarctic organisms confirmed their global transport and distribution; the detection of lower brominated congeners suggested a potential long-range transport.

Given the fact that the xenobiotics detected in polar ecosystems are persistent and toxic, investigating the presence of these chemicals in a pristine environment such as Antarctica has become a priority. In specimens of the most important key species of Antarctic marine food web, Euphausia superba and Pleuragramma antarcticum sampled in the Ross Sea, we evaluated concentrations of the following persistent organic pollutants: polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), chlorinated pesticides such as hexachlorobenzene (HCB), and p,p'-DDE. Sampling was carried out in the framework of the Italian National Program for Research in Antarctica (PNRA) from 1999 to 2000. PCB concentrations were higher than HCB and p,p'-DDE by two orders of magnitude; levels of HCB and p,p'-DDE, in the range of 1-5 ng/g wet weight, were low compared to those reported for species in lower latitude marine environments. PCBs values were comparable to those determined in moderately contaminated areas. PCB fingerprints and patterns of isomer classes showed a predominance of low-chlorinated PCBs: tri-, tetra- and penta-CB congeners constituted more than 50% of the total residue in krill and larvae and less than 50% in adult silverfish. The pattern seems common to that of Kanechlor, a technical mixture used mostly in Japan and other Eastern Asian countries that are roughly at the same longitude of the Ross Sea.

J	Ward, P; Shreeve, RS				Ward, P; Shreeve, RS			The spring mesozooplankton community at South Georgia: a comparison of shelf and oceanic sites	POLAR BIOLOGY												Mesozooplankton (predominantly 200-2000 mu m) were sampled at a shelf and an oceanic station close to South Georgia, South Atlantic, during austral spring (October/November) 1997. Onshelf zooplankton biomass was extremely high at 10-16 g dry mass m(-2) (0-150 m), 70% comprising the small neritic clausocalaniid copepod Drepanopus forcipatus. Large calanoid species, principally Calanoides acutus and Rhincalanus gigas, contributed only 8-10%. At the oceanic station, biomass in the sampled water column (0-1000 m) was similar to 6.5 g dry mass m(-2) and 4-6 g dry mass m(-2) in the top 200 m. Here, large calanoids composed 40-50% of the standing stock. Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) occurred in low abundances at both stations. Vertical profiles obtained with a Longhurst Hardy Plankton Recorder indicated that populations of C. acutus and R, gigas, which overwinter at depth, had completed their spring ascent and were resident in surface waters. Dry mass, carbon and lipid values were lower than found in summer but were consistent with overwintered populations. Phytoplankton concentrations were considerably higher at the oceanic station (2-3 mg chlorophyll a m(-3)) and increased over the time on station. In response to this, egg production of both large calanoid species and growth rates of R. gigas approached those measured in summer. Onshelf phytoplankton concentrations were lower (<1 mg m(-3)), and low egg production rates suggested food limitation, Here phytoplankton rations equivalent to 6% zooplankton body C would have been sufficient to clear primary production whereas at the oceanic station daily carbon fixation was broadly equivalent to zooplankton carbon biomass.																	0722-4060					NOV	1999	22	5					289	301		10.1007/s003000050422							WOS:000083378800001

The administration of krill oil is reported to mitigate inflammation in patients with cardiac disease, rheumatoid arthritis, or osteoarthritis. However, the effect of krill oil on mild knee pain has not yet been determined. Objective To assess the effect of krill oil on mild knee pain. Design A randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled trial of fifty adults (38-85 years old) with mild knee pain attending the Fukushima Orthopedic Clinic (Tochigi, Japan) between September 2014 and March 2015. Interventions Participants were randomized to receive 2 g per day of either krill oil or an identical placebo for 30 days. Outcomes The primary outcome was improvement in subjective symptoms of knee pain as assessed by the Japanese Knee Osteoarthritis Measure (JKOM) and Japanese Orthopaedic Association score (JOA). Secondary outcomes included blood and urine biochemical parameters. Results Both the placebo and krill oil groups showed significant improvements in the questions in the JKOM and JOA questionnaires after administration. After the intervention, krill oil group showed more improvements than placebo group in two questions regarding the pain and stiffness in knees in JKOM. Controlling for age, sex, weight, and smoking and drinking habits, krill oil significantly mitigated knee pain in sleeping (P < 0.001), standing (P < 0.001) and the range of motion of both right and left knees (both P = 0.011) compared to placebo. Krill oil administration raised plasma EPA (P = 0.048) and EPA/AA ratio (P = 0.003). Conclusion This study indicates that krill oil administration (2 g/day, 30 days) improved the subjective symptoms of knee pain in adults with mild knee pain.

We also investigated the potential to mitigate depletion risk for predators by curtailing krill fishing at different points in the 21st century. The projected effects of ocean warming on krill biomass were strongest in the northern Scotia Sea, with a >= 40% decline in the mass of individual krill. Projections also suggest a 25% chance that krill biomass will fall below an established depletion threshold (75% of its unimpacted level), with consequent risks for some predator populations, especially penguins. Average penguin abundance declined by up to 30% of its unimpacted level, with up to a 50% chance of falling below the depletion threshold. Simulated krill fishing at currently permitted harvest rates further increased risks for depletion, and stopping fishing offset the increased risks associated with ocean warming in our model to some extent. These results varied by location and species group. Risk reductions at smaller spatial scales also differed from those at the regional level, which suggests that some predator populations may be more vulnerable than others to future changes in krill biomass. However, impacts on predators did not always map directly to those for krill. Our findings indicate the importance of identifying vulnerable marine populations and targeting protection measures at appropriate spatial scales, and the potential for spatially-structured management to avoid aggravating risks associated with rising ocean temperatures. This may help balance tradeoffs among marine ecosystem services in an uncertain future.				, Jefferson/AAG-1702-2021; Simeon, Hill L/B-2307-2008	, Jefferson/0000-0002-3600-1414; 												1932-6203					JAN 31	2018	13	1							e0191011	10.1371/journal.pone.0191011							WOS:000423668400032	29385153					
J	Tremblay, N; Abele, D				Tremblay, Nelly; Abele, Doris			Response of three krill species to hypoxia and warming: an experimental approach to oxygen minimum zones expansion in coastal ecosystems	MARINE ECOLOGY-AN EVOLUTIONARY PERSPECTIVE												To understand the adaptation of euphausiid (krill) species to oxygen minimum zones (OMZs), respiratory response and stress experiments combining hypoxia-reoxygenation exposure with warming were conducted. Experimental krill species were obtained from the Antarctic (South Georgia area), the Humboldt Current System (HCS, Chilean coast) and the Northern California Current System (NCCS, Oregon). Euphausia mucronata from the HCS showed oxyconforming pO(2)-dependent respiration below 80% air saturation (18kPa). Normoxic subsurface oxygenation in winter posed a high oxygen stress' for this species. The NCCS krill, Euphausia pacifica, and the Antarctic krill, Euphausia superba, maintained respiration rates constant down to low critical pO(2) values of 6kPa (30% air saturation) and 11kPa (55% air saturation), respectively. Antarctic krill had low antioxidant enzyme activities, but high concentrations of the molecular antioxidant glutathione (GSH) and was not lethally affected by 6h exposure to moderate hypoxia. The temperate krill species (E.pacifica) had higher superoxide dismutase (SOD) values in winter than in summer, which relates to a higher winter metabolic rate. In all species, antioxidant enzyme activities remained constant during hypoxic exposure at the typical temperature for their habitat. Warming by 7 degrees C above habitat temperature in summer increased SOD activities and GSH levels in E.mucronata (HCS), but no oxidative damage occurred. In winter, when the NCCS is well mixed and the OMZ is deeper, +4 degrees C of warming combined with hypoxia represents a lethal condition for E.pacifica. In summer, when the OMZ expands upwards (100m subsurface), antioxidant defences counteracted hypoxia and reoxygenation effects in E.pacifica, but only at mildly elevated temperature (+2 degrees C). In this season, experimental warming by +4 degrees C reduced antioxidant activities and the combination of warming with hypoxia again caused mortality of exposed specimens. We conclude that a climate change scenario combining warming and hypoxia represents a serious threat to E.pacifica and, as a consequence, NCCS food webs.				, Nelly/K-2552-2014	, Nelly/0000-0002-8221-4680; Abele, Doris/0000-0002-5766-5017												0173-9565	1439-0485				FEB	2016	37	1					179	199		10.1111/maec.12258							WOS:000370133500013

This separated the echo traces into five categories: three biotic and two abiotic in origin. The acoustic data were subsequently analysed in detail by comparing the acoustic parameter Mean Volume Backscattering Strength (MVBS) at 120 kHz with that at 38 kHz. The three biotic categories separated visually had significantly different mean DELTAMVBS values (DELTAMVBS = MVBS 120 kHz - MVBS 38 kHz). To investigate if the biotic categories could be identified solely on the basis of DELTAMVBS values, maximum-likelihood techniques were used to analyse the multimodal distribution of a further 1286 DELTAMVBS records. These analyses allowed ranges to be defined for DELTAMVBS which separate three biotic categories. On the basis of the target strength properties of the most likely scatterers in the region, the three categories were identified as krill, organisms larger than krill (fish or squid) and organisms smaller than krill (small zooplankton). The acoustic techniques described in this paper indicate a useful methodology in the study of Southern Ocean pelagic organisms.																	0142-7873					JUL	1993	15	7					787	802		10.1093/plankt/15.7.787							WOS:A1993LM94100005						
J	Ainley, DG; Pauly, D				Ainley, David G.; Pauly, Daniel			Fishing down the food web of the Antarctic continental shelf and slope	POLAR RECORD												The history of biotic exploitation for the continental margin (shelf and slope) of the Antarctic Large Marine Ecosystem (LME) is reviewed, with emphasis on the period from 1970 to 2010. In the Antarctic Peninsula portion, marine mammals were decimated by the 1970s and groundfish by the early 1980s. Fishing for Antarctic krill Euphausia superba began upon the demise of groundfish and now is the only fishing that remains in this region. Surveys show that cetacean and most groundfish stocks remain severely depressed, harvest of which is now prohibited by the International Whaling Commission and the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR). On the other hand, krill fishing in this region is underway and in recent years has contributed up to 72% of the Southern Ocean catch, depending on fishing conditions and the CCAMLR conservation measures in force. Elsewhere along the Antarctic continental margin, marine mammals were also severely depleted by the 1970s, followed directly by relatively low-level fisheries for krill that continued until the early 1990s. Recently in these areas, where fin-fishing is still allowed, fisheries for Antarctic toothfish Dissostichus mawsoni have been initiated, with one of this fish's main prey, grenadiers Macrourus spp., being taken significantly as by-catch. Continental margin fishing currently accounts for similar to 25% of the total toothfish catch of the Southern Ocean. Fishing along the Antarctic continental margin, especially the Antarctic Peninsula region, is a clear case of both the tragedy of the commons and fishing down the food web'.

Stable isotope analysis of ancient and modern gentoo penguin egg membrane and the krill surplus hypothesis in Antarctica	ANTARCTIC SCIENCE												The 'krill surplus' hypothesis in Antarctica posits that the historic depletion of krill-eating whales and seals in the 18-20th centuries provided a surplus of krill in the Southern Ocean that benefited penguins. A previous study which examined stable isotopes in ancient and modern tissues of Adelie penguin (Pygoscelis adeliae) provides support for this hypothesis. Specifically, a significant decrease in delta C-13 and delta N-15 values occurred in modern versus ancient tissues from an apparent dietary shift from fish to krill associated with the purported krill surplus. Here, we present new data on gentoo penguin (Pygoscelis papua) tissues from active and abandoned colonies at three locations in the Antarctic Peninsula. We found an overall, but weak, decrease in modern versus fossil delta N-15 and delta C-13 values of gentoo penguin egg membrane with considerable variation across three breeding sites. Dietary mixing models suggest that shifts between fish and krill in gentoo penguins were likely not as strong as those previously observed in Adelie penguins. This weaker signal probably results from the greater reliance on fish in their diets, past and present, though we cannot rule out declines in primary productivity or other ecosystem shifts which also could account for declines in delta C-13 and delta N-15 values.

J	Chiuchiolo, AL; Dickhut, RM; Cochran, MA; Ducklow, HW				Chiuchiolo, AL; Dickhut, RM; Cochran, MA; Ducklow, HW			Persistent organic pollutants at the base of the Antarctic marine food web	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Various organochlorine pesticides and brominated diphenyl ethers (BDE-47, -99, and -100) were measured in sea ice algae, water column plankton, and juvenile and adult krill collected in the Palmer Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) region west of the Antarctic Peninsula during late austral winter and midsummer, 2001-2002. BDEs were 100-1000 times higher in ice algae and 2-10 times higher in phytoplankton than the most abundant organochlorine pesticide, hexachlorobenzene (HCB), reflecting the current production and use of BDEs versus organochlorine pesticides. However, concentrations of HCB and BDEs were significantly lower in summer plankton than in ice algae indicating lower atmospheric inputs, removal from the water column, and/or biodilution of persistent organic pollutants at the base of the food web during summer. Concentrations of HCB (juvenile and adult krill) and BIDES (juvenile krill) were not significantly different from their primary food source (ice algae, phytoplankton), and BDEs were significantly lower in adult krill versus phytoplankton, indicating no biomagnification of HCB or BIDES during transfer from plankton to krill. The high concentrations of BDEs and HCB in ice algae and associated juvenile krill illustrate the importance of sea ice as a vector for entry of POPS into the Antarctic marine ecosystem.																	0013-936X	1520-5851				JUL 1	2004	38	13					3551	3557		10.1021/es0351793							WOS:000222396400020	15296304

Ocean-atmosphere exchange of organic carbon and CO2 surrounding the Antarctic Peninsula	BIOGEOSCIENCES												Exchangeable organic carbon (OC) dynamics and CO2 fluxes in the Antarctic Peninsula during austral summer were highly variable, but the region appeared to be a net sink for OC and nearly in balance for CO2. Surface exchangeable dissolved organic carbon (EDOC) measurements had a 43 +/- 3 (standard error, hereafter SE) mol CL-1 overall mean and represented around 66% of surface non-purgeable dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in Antarctic waters, while the mean concentration of the gaseous fraction of organic carbon (GOCH'(-1)) was 46 +/- 3 SE mu mol C L-1. There was a tendency towards low fugacity of dissolved CO2 (fCO(2-w)) in waters with high chlorophyll a (Chl a) content and high fCO(2-w) in areas with high krill densities. However, such relationships were not found for EDOC. The depth profiles of EDOC were also quite variable and occasionally followed Chl a profiles. The diel cycles of EDOC showed two distinct peaks, in the middle of the day and the middle of the short austral dark period, concurrent with solar radiation maxima and krill night migration patterns. However, no evident diel pattern for GOC H'(-1) or CO2 was observed. The pool of exchangeable OC is an important and active compartment of the carbon budget surrounding the Antarctic Peninsula and adds to previous studies highlighting its importance in the redistribution of carbon in marine environments.

Sea state is shown to cause significant noise close to the surface, but to cause no significant signal attenuation.

This process is considered to diminish disc pressure on inflamed nerve roots, resulting in the alleviation of sciatic pain. In the present study two krill (Euphasia superba) enzyme preparations, a proteinase and an esterase preparation, were evaluated for their potential as chemonucleolytic agents. Initially, their ability to degrade several protein (azocoll, casein, proteoglycans, PGs) and peptide (CBZ-arg-4-nitroanilide, CBZ-lys-thiobenzyl ester) substrates was assessed in vitro. The krill proteinase preparation rapidly converted azocoll, casein and PGs to small peptides. Furthermore, when this degradative enzyme preparation was evaluated in vivo, a relatively low intradiscal dose (0.54 mg/disc) was found to reduce intervertebral disc widths in beagles to 48% +/- 10.5% (mean +/- SEM) of their pre-injection values within 2 weeks of administration. Moreover, the discs injected with this proteinase had reconstituted up to 80% +/- 9% (mean +/- SEM) of their pre-injection widths at the termination of the experiment (32 weeks). These data suggest that the krill protease preparation has potential as a chemonucleolytic agent which would allow disc matrix reconstitution, Conversely, the krill esterase preparation also degraded PGs, but into relatively large fragments. This limited digestion of PGs indicates that the krill esterase would be a less effective chemonucleolytic agent than the corresponding proteinase.

The growth rate hypothesis of stoichiometric theory states that a negative relationship exists between nitrogen: phosphorus (N: P) stoichiometry and growth rate, driven by cellular ribosomal ribonucleic acid (rRNA) content. Despite the wealth of literature on the growth rate hypothesis, there exist no practical demonstrations of its use in the marine literature. We thus investigated whether this hypothesis could be the basis of a technique to estimate growth rates of Euphausia superba by comparing, for the same individual krill, elemental stoichiometry and growth rates derived from the instantaneous growth rate (IGR) method. These growth rates were the first IGR measurements from South Georgia; from within a restricted area over the course of just 1 month, these rates were highly variable, from negative to near maximum rates recorded for the species. Although there were significant differences in N: P ratio and phosphorus content between individuals and schools, there was no relationship between N: P ratio and growth rate when data were grouped by school. Thus, our data do not support the predictions of the growth rate hypothesis at an intraspecific scale. However, when all data were pooled, the mean values of growth rate and N: P ratio did fit the interspecific relationship established previously for freshwater zooplankton. We suggest that krill maintain the biochemical machinery for high growth potential and maintain high growth in summer to take advantage of short-term fluctuations in food.																	0024-3590	1939-5590				NOV	2004	49	6					2152	2161		10.4319/lo.2004.49.6.2152							WOS:000225137100023

The first genome size estimates for six species of krill (Malacostraca, Euphausiidae): large genomes at the north and south poles	POLAR BIOLOGY												Krill (family Euphausiidae) represent some of the most abundant organisms in the both northern and southern oceanic environments and provide food for various animals including humans. Despite their importance, little is known about krill from a genomic standpoint, even with regard to basic properties such as total genome size. This study provides genome size estimates for six species of krill from both the North Atlantic and Southern Oceans which are the first such estimates for any species of euphausiid. Genome size estimates were obtained using both flow cytometry and Feulgen image analysis densitometry with chicken and trout blood as internal standards. Haploid genome sizes ranged from 12.77 to 48.53 pg, providing roughly fourfold variation within these six species alone. With such large estimates, sequencing of a krill genome will currently be costly and laborious, but further studies should be conducted to determine the composition of these exceptionally large genomes.

Predation rates on Acartia 10.004 to 0.144 Acartia (mg acetone-extracted dry weight, E(dw))-1 h-1] were comparable to those of more carnivorous krill and were up to 32 times higher than grazing rates on C. gracilis. Ingestion rates on C gracilis were very low (0.45 to 3.45 ng pigment mg-1 E(dw) h-1), but because of their small size, algae like C gracilis may be suboptimal food for N. australis. We used a Holling type III model to describe the predation functional response. A Michaelis-Menten model best described the grazing functional response. N. australis ingested Acartia at significantly lower rates when algae were present. This effect was independent of algal concentration: ingestion rates of Acartia at 3.1, 7.5 and 17.0 mug chl a l-1 were not significantly different. Parameter estimates showed that the presence of C gracilis reduced the attack rate on, and increased the handling time of, Acartia. Presumably the increased time spent processing (capturing, handling, ingesting) C. gracilis reduced the time available to search for Acartia. Krill ingested pigment faster at high copepod concentrations. Analysis of gut pigment in N. australis feeding on Acartia alone showed that significant quantities of pigment can be derived from either the stomachs of ingested prey or copepod faeces. The implications of this finding are that herbivorous feeding rates measured in situ by the gut fluorescence technique may be biased for omnivorous zooplankton.																	0171-8630	1616-1599				APR	1994	107	1-2					41	53		10.3354/meps107041							WOS:A1994NH21600004

Despite their ecological importance, estimating seasonal or interannual changes in ice algal production at the Antarctic circumpolar scale is not presently possible. We show that the product of ice concentration and irradiance penetrating into sea ice (Eice) explains 69% of the variability in ice algal production at the sector and seasonal scale estimated from two respected sea ice algae models. After allowing for a greater quantum yield of sea ice algae in summer than in other seasons we estimated a simple light-based index of potential ice algal production (Pice) and this explained 91% of the variability in modelled ice algal production. Our results suggest that between 1987 and 2017, ice algal production has generally increased with the largest increases seen off East Antarctica, the Weddell Sea, and the western Ross Sea.																	0924-7963	1879-1573				SEP	2021	221								103576	10.1016/j.jmarsys.2021.103576							WOS:000658513500001						
J	Klein, ES; Watters, GM				Klein, Emily S.; Watters, George M.			Comparing feedback and spatial approaches to advance ecosystem-based fisheries management in a changing Antarctic	PLOS ONE												To implement ecosystem-based approaches to fisheries management, decision makers need insight on the potential costs and benefits of the policy options available to them. In the Southern Ocean, two such options for addressing trade-offs between krill-dependent predators and the krill fishery include "feedback management" (FBM) strategies and marine protected areas (MPAs); in theory, the first adjusts to change, while the latter is robust to change. We compared two possible FBM options to a proposed MPA in the Antarctic Peninsula and Scotia Sea given a changing climate. One of our feedback options, based on the density of Antarctic krill (Euphasia superba), projected modest increases in the abundances of some populations of krill predators, whereas outcomes from our second FBM option, based on changes in the abundances of penguins, were more mixed, with some areas projecting predator population declines. The MPA resulted in greater increases in some, but not all, predator populations than either feedback strategy. We conclude that these differing outcomes relate to the ways the options separate fishing and predator foraging, either by continually shifting the spatial distribution of fishing away from potentially vulnerable populations (FBM) or by permanently closing areas to fishing (the MPA). For the krill fishery, we show that total catches could be maintained using an FBM approach or slightly increased with the MPA, but the fishery would be forced to adjust fishing locations and sometimes fish in areas of relatively low krill density-both potentially significant costs. Our work demonstrates the potential to shift, rather than avoid, ecological risks and the likely costs of fishing, indicating trade-offs for decision makers to consider.

Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1-NF-E2-related factor 2 (KEAP1-NRF2) axis is a crucial antioxidant signaling pathway. Thus, AKO may exert its antioxidant effects on CHD patients via KEAP1-NRF2 signaling.Methods. AKO fatty acid (FA) profiles were analyzed by using gas chromatography (GC). One hundred CHD patients were divided into the intervention (IG, AKO) and control (CG, placebo) groups. Before and after 1, 2, and 3 months of intervention, we measured serum levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), 8-hydroxy-2-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), nitric oxide (NO), malondialdehyde (MDA), superoxide dismutase (SOD), reduced glutathione (GSH), and glutathione peroxidase (GPx), and KEAP1 and NRF2 levels in peripheral blood leukocytes (PBLs). Serum FAs were measured by GC at baseline and after 3-month intervention.Results. AKO contains rich eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), which is more than 27% of total FA. The levels of EPA and DHA, KEAP1, and NRF2 in the IG group were higher than those in the CG group (p<0.05). Serum levels of ROS, 8-OHdG, NO, and MDA in the IG group were lower than those in the CG group, whereas the levels of SOD, GSH, and GPx in the IG group were higher than those in the CG group (p<0.05). Serum levels of saturated fatty acids (UFA) in the IG group were higher than those in the CG group, whereas reverse results were obtained for the levels of saturated fatty acids (SFA). Serum levels of EPA and DHA had a strong negative relationship with the level of ROS, whereas the ROS level had a strong negative relationship with the levels of KEAP1-NRF2.Conclusion. AKO increases antioxidant capacities of CHD patients via the KEAP1-NRF2 signaling in the PBL.																	1741-427X	1741-4288				OCT 7	2020	2020								9534137	10.1155/2020/9534137							WOS:000583241300002	33082834

We aimed to quantify the differences in upstream advection resulting from the interaction between the circulation and the specific diel vertical migration of T. raschii and M. norvegica at the scale of the northwest GSL. We coupled a regional circulation model with Lagrangian models where the daytime depth followed specific functions of surface salinity. Our results help to explain the spatio-temporal variability in both T. raschii and M. norvegica distributions. We identified in particular spatio-temporal patterns in krill upstream transport. During summer and autumn, the upstream transport of krill is steady across Jacques Cartier Strait, limited across Honguedo Strait, and more sporadic across the Estuary mouth. We estimated that the upstream advection of krill particles across the Estuary mouth would be higher by 16-17% for the T. raschii than for the M. norvegica daytime behaviour. Our results also suggest that the advective processes operating on the adults during the productive season are not the only cause for the observed magnitude of the interannual and interspecific variability in krill abundance.

Icefish Adaptations to Climate Change on the South Georgia Island Shelf (Sub-Antarctic)	OCEAN SCIENCE JOURNAL												Icefish populations continue to decline. Historical as well as current over-exploitations of stocks aggravated by climate change are frequently seen as responsible for the decline. However, natural oscillations in Antarctic fish and krill populations associated with natural climatic fluctuations, co-occurring with fisheries exploitation hinder determining the reasons for the population changes and the extent that long-term climate change may play in it. Based on data collected from South Shetland and South Orkney Islands (2956 fish stations) and South Georgia Island (2460 fish stations) covering a period from 1976 to 2017 we sought to relate decreases in krill and icefish populations to predator-prey interactions coupled with global warming influences. Our results show that the situation is complex and that many factors, e.g., competition between different icefish species, food choice and availability, and growth parameters, need to be considered.Pseudochaenichthys georgianusandChaenocephalus aceratusbiomasses, for example, oscillate in opposite directions and the two species differ with regard to the ranges they occupy in cold and warm water years. This reduces their competition for food, so that their combined biomasses oscillate little with thermal changes.																	1738-5261	2005-7172				JUN	2020	55	2					303	319		10.1007/s12601-020-0016-8		JUN 2020					WOS:000539187800001						
J	Dahood, A; Watters, GM; de Mutsert, K				Dahood, Adrian; Watters, George M.; de Mutsert, Kim			Using sea-ice to calibrate a dynamic trophic model for the Western Antarctic Peninsula	PLOS ONE												The pelagic ecosystems of the Western Antarctic Peninsula are dynamic and changing rapidly in the face of sustained warming. There is already evidence that warming may be impacting the food web. Antarctic krill, Euphausia superba, is an ice-associated species that is both an important prey item and the target of the only commercial fishery operating in the region. The goal of this study is to develop a dynamic trophic model for the region that includes the impact of the sea-ice regime on krill and krill predators. Such a model may be helpful to fisheries managers as they develop new management strategies in the face of continued sea-ice loss. A mass balanced food-web model (Ecopath) and time dynamic simulations (Ecosim) were created. The Ecopath model includes eight currently monitored species as single species to facilitate its future development into a model that could be used for marine protected area planning in the region. The Ecosim model is calibrated for the years 1996-2012. The successful calibration represents an improvement over existing Ecopath models for the region. Simulations indicate that the role of sea ice is both central and complex. The simulations are only able to recreate observed biomass trends for the monitored species when metrics describing the sea-ice regime are used to force key predator-prey interactions, and to drive the biomasses of Antarctic krill and the fish species Gobionotothen gibberifrons. This model is ready to be used for exploring results from sea-ice scenarios or to be developed into a spatial model that informs discussions regarding the design of marine protected areas in the region.				de Mutsert, Kim/AAV-1035-2020	de Mutsert, Kim/0000-0002-7902-3787; Dahood, Adrian/0000-0001-5346-8537												1932-6203					APR 2	2019	14	4							e0214814	10.1371/journal.pone.0214814							WOS:000462993900041	30939156					
J	Santora, JA				Santora, Jarrod A.			Dynamic intra-seasonal habitat use by Antarctic fur seals suggests migratory hotspots near the Antarctic Peninsula	MARINE BIOLOGY												Antarctic fur seals (Arctocephalus gazella) are major secondary consumers in the Southern Ocean, placing them in potential competition with commercial fisheries and requiring research to understand their seasonal habitat use. Using the data obtained during 14 shipboard surveys sampled on a fixed grid (150 K km(2)) during mid- to late summer, I quantified the spatial distribution and intra-seasonal variability of fur seal sightings relative to distance to land and hydrographic boundaries. I test the hypothesis that fur seals display an increase in their at-sea abundance during mid- to late summer near the Antarctic Peninsula as they prepare to take up wintering grounds. I also test whether abundances of their potential prey, krill and myctophids, exhibit intra-seasonal variability. During midsummer, high-abundance areas are located near major breeding colonies; however, during late summer, there is an order-of-magnitude increase in fur seal abundance, coinciding with an increase in the number of high-abundance areas located in Bransfield Strait. Coincidently, abundance of Euphausia superba decreased and the myctophid Electrona antarctica increased between mid- and late-summer surveys. High-abundance areas of fur seals are not associated with the southern Antarctic Circumpolar Current front but are concentrated within 100 km from land, potentially indicating the location of haul out and important coastal habitat use areas. The dynamic increase in the number and location of high-abundance areas during late summer represents a considerable amount of mammalian predators entering the Antarctic Peninsula marine ecosystem. This information is important for understanding the seasonal impact of fur seals on regional marine food webs and their potential interaction with the autumn-winter krill fishery.																	0025-3162					JUN	2013	160	6					1383	1393		10.1007/s00227-013-2190-z							WOS:000319360100008

Using an echosounder system, combined with an autonomous Video Plankton Recorder (Auto-VPR) and Jacknet samplings, we describe the migration pattern, the associated biomass and the macrozooplankton species involved. The net sampling and the Auto-VPR images allowed us to identify the krill species detected in the echosounder signals, which corresponded to Euphausia lucens, Euphausia vallentini and Nematoscelis megalops. The krill community followed a "normal pattern" of DVM, ascending at dusk (similar to 18:30 h) and descending at dawn (similar to 06:30 h), forming a dense layer near the bottom during the day. Krill vertical migration speed was estimated from the echogram data at similar to 1 cm s(-1) (1 body length per s for 1-cm-long animal), and the integrated mean biomass was 57.8 g m(-2). This study provides a description of temporal and spatial patterns of krill vertical distribution, which should be taken into account when studying the complexity of the SJG ecosystem dynamics and carbon flux.																	0142-7873	1464-3774				JUL-AUG	2021	43	4					610	623		10.1093/plankt/fbab047							WOS:000684173000008

Here, we analysed 42 scats of male Antarctic fur seals (Arctocephalus gazella) collected in late summer at Deception Island (South Shetland Islands), which allowed us to assess the presence of microplastics in the pelagic food web of the Bransfield Strait (Western Antarctica). Furthermore, we analysed the hard remains of prey in the scats to characterize the diet of fur seals. Hard remains recovered from the scats revealed that male Antarctic fur seals foraged on krill and myctophid fishes during late summer. Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) revealed that none of the seven fragments and three fibres recovered from their scats were microplastics, but rather were silicate minerals and chitin. These results suggest that the levels of microplastic pollution in the pelagic food web of the Bransfield Strait are extremely low. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Until now, information on important environmental factors affecting its distribution as well as on foraging behaviour is limited. In austral summer 1998, 12 crabeater seals of both sexes and different age classes were equipped with satellite-linked dive recorders at Drescher Inlet (72.85A degrees S, 19.26A degrees E), eastern Weddell Sea. To identify suitable habitat conditions within the Weddell Sea, a maximum entropy (Maxent) modelling approach was implemented. The model revealed that the eastern and southern Weddell Sea is especially suitable for crabeater seals. Distance to the continental shelf break and sea ice concentration were the two most important parameters in modelling species distribution throughout the study period. Model predictions demonstrated that crabeater seals showed a dynamic response to their seasonally changing environment emphasized by the favoured sea ice conditions. Crabeater seals utilized ice-free waters substantially, which is potentially explained by the comparatively low sea ice cover of the Weddell Sea during summer 1998. Diving behaviour was characterized by short (> 90 % = 0-4 min) and shallow (> 90 % = 0-51 m) dives. This pattern reflects the typical summer and autumn foraging behaviour of crabeater seals. Both the distribution and foraging behaviour corresponded well with the life history of the Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba), the preferred prey of crabeater seals. In general, predicted suitable habitat conditions were congruent with probable habitats of krill, which emphasizes the strong dependence on their primary prey.

The dominance of this particular group over diatoms affects grazers, such as Antarctic krill, which preferentially feed on diatoms. Using three late summer data sets from the Bransfield Strait (2008-2010), we observed variations in the dominant phytoplankton groups determined by HPLC/CHEMTAX pigment analysis and confirmed by microscopy. Results indicate that the dominance of diatoms, particularly in 2008 and 2009, was associated with a deeper upper mixed layer (UML), higher salinity and warmer sea surface temperature. In contrast, cryptophytes, which were dominant in 2010, were associated with a shallower UML, lower salinity and colder sea surface temperatures. The low diatom biomass observed in the summer of 2010 was associated with high nutrient concentration, particularly silicate, and low chlorophyll a (summer monthly average calculated from satellite images). The interannual variability here observed suggests a delayed seasonal succession cycle of phytoplankton in the summer of 2010 associated with a cold summer and a late ice retreat process in the region. This successional delay resulted in a notable decrease of primary producers' biomass, which is likely to have impacted regional food web interactions. This study demonstrates the susceptibility of the Antarctic phytoplankton community structure to air temperature, which directly influences the timing of ice melting and consequently the magnitude of primary production and succession pattern of phytoplankton groups.				de Souza, Marcio Silva/AAR-5757-2021; Brotas, Vanda/A-2410-2012; Mendes, Carlos/AAD-6504-2021; Leal, Miguel Costa/C-8611-2009; Tavano, Virginia/C-5241-2013; Garcia, Carlos A.

J	Agersted, MD; Nielsen, TG				Agersted, Mette Dalgaard; Nielsen, Torkel Gissel			Functional biology of sympatric krill species	JOURNAL OF PLANKTON RESEARCH												Here we compare the functional biology of the sympatric krill species, Meganyctiphanes norvegica and Thysanoessa inermis. For M. norvegica, we investigated functional responses on diatoms and copepods, together with prey size spectra on plankton,400 mu m and copepods in the size range 500-3220 mu m. For T. inermis, only prey size spectrum on plankton,400 mu m were investigated. The prey size ranges of both species include organisms,400 mu m, and they consequently graze on several trophic levels. However, T. inermis feed on cells,10 mu m equivalent spherical diameter (ESD), whereas M. norvegica only feed on cells >10 mu m. Meganyctiphanes norvegica show maximum predation on 8001600 mu m sized copepods, corresponding to a predator: prey size ratio of 17.0 +/- 2.2. Functional response experiments with M. norvegica follow a Holling type III functional response, both when feeding on diatoms and copepods, but with an order of magnitude higher ingestion rate on the copepod prey. The two functional groups, M. norvegica and Thysanoessa spp., overlap in prey size spectra. However, there are differences in their ability to exploit different prey classes. Here, we present clearance rates of both krill species on natural plankton illustrating the two species' wide particle range spectra.

Macrofauna under sea ice and in the open surface layer of the Lazarev Sea, Southern Ocean	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY												A new fishing gear was used to sample the macrozooplankton and micronekton community in the surface layer (0-2 m) under ice and in open water, the Surface and Under Ice Trawl (SUIT). In total, 57 quantitative hauls were conducted in the Lazarev Sea (Southern Ocean) during 3 different seasons (autumn 2004, winter 2006, summer 2007/2008). At least 46 species from eight phyla were caught in all 3 seasons combined. Biomass density was dominated by Antarctic krill Euphausia superba. The average biomass density was highest under the winter sea ice and lowest under the young ice in autumn. In summer, macrozooplankton biomass was dominated by ctenophores in open water and by Antarctic krill under ice. The community composition varied significantly among seasons, and according to the presence of sea ice. The response of the community composition to the presence of sea ice was influenced by species that were significantly more abundant in open water than under ice (Cyllopus lucasii, Hyperiella dilatata), only seasonally abundant under ice (Clione antarctica), or significantly associated with sea ice (Eusirus laticarpus). A number of abundant species showed distinct diel patterns in the surface occurrence both under ice and in open water, indicating that the surface layer serves as a foraging ground predominantly at night. Our results emphasize the potential of a number of non-euphausiid macrozooplankton and micronekton species to act as energy transmitters between the production of sea ice biota and the pelagic food web. By providing a regional-scale quantitative record of macrofauna under Antarctic sea ice covering 3 seasons, this study adds new and direct evidence that the ice-water interface layer is a major functional node in the ecosystem of the Antarctic seasonal sea ice zone.

Spatial heterogeneity in the timing of ice melt generates temporal variability in the development of these events across the habitat, offering a natural framework to assess how foraging marine predators respond to the spring phenology. We combined 4 yr of tracking data of Antarctic petrels Thalassoica antarctica with synoptic remote-sensing data on sea ice and chlorophyll a to test how the development of melting ice and primary production drive Antarctic petrel foraging. Cross-correlation analyses of first-passage time revealed that Antarctic petrels utilized foraging areas with a spatial scale of 300 km. These areas changed position or disappeared within 10 to 30 d and showed no spatial consistency among years. Generalized additive model (GAM) analyses suggested that the presence of foraging areas was related to the time since ice melt. Antarctic petrels concentrated their search effort in melting areas and in areas that had reached an age of 50 to 60 d from the date of ice melt. We found no significant relationship between search effort and chlorophyll a concentration. We suggest that these foraging patterns were related to the vertical distribution and profitability of the main prey, the Antarctic krill Euphausia superba. Our study demonstrates that the annual ice melt in the Southern Ocean shapes the development of a highly patchy and elusive food web, underscoring the importance of flexible foraging strategies among top predators.

The southern ACC front (SACCF), one of three major fronts associated with the ACC, wraps anticyclonically around South Georgia and then retroflects north of the island. This paper investigates temporal variability in the position of the SACCF north of South Georgia that is likely to have an effect on the South Georgia ecosystem by contributing to the variability in local krill abundance. A meridional hydrographic section that crossed the SACCF three times demonstrates that the SACCF is associated with a geopotential anomaly of 4.5 J kg(-1) in the eastern Scotia Sea. A high resolution (1/4degrees x 1/4degrees) map of historical geopotential anomaly shows the mean position of the SACCF retroflection north of South Georgia to be at 36degreesW, 400 km further east than in previous work. It also reveals temporal variability associated with the SACCF in the South Georgia region, A near-surface drifter provides evidence for variability in the western extent of the SACCF north of South Georgia and for the presence of eddies in the region.

In comparison with recent years the station grid was extended south, where a large proportion of small size classes, one-year-old juvenile krill was found. Results show a spatial separation of the juvenile krill and the spawning stock. Krill density was significantly higher than during the past years (229 krill 1000 m(-3) or 13.0 g m(-2)). The proportional recruitment index for the entire survey area for the 1999/2000 year class was R-1 = 0.573, which is among the highest values recorded during the past 20 years. The maturation index (based on the proportion of gravid stages) was G = 0.99, indicating an early initiation of the spawning season. The results indicate a turning point after a succession of years with poor recruitment success and low stock biomass. This is thought to be the first step for a successful spawning event and a later potential recruitment success of the 2000/01 year-class. The spatial extent of the station grid is discussed in the light of a representative coverage of the stock and the estimated recruitment index.																	0954-1020					JUN	2002	14	2					162	170		10.1017/S095410200200072X							WOS:000176315100008

Variability in krill biomass links harvesting and climate warming to penguin population changes in Antarctica	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA												The West Antarctic Peninsula (WAP) and adjacent Scotia Sea support abundant wildlife populations, many of which were nearly extirpated by humans. This region is also among the fastest-warming areas on the planet, with 5-6 degrees C increases in mean winter air temperatures and associated decreases in winter sea-ice cover. These biological and physical perturbations have affected the ecosystem profoundly. One hypothesis guiding ecological interpretations of changes in top predator populations in this region, the "sea-ice hypothesis," proposes that reductions in winter sea ice have led directly to declines in "ice-loving" species by decreasing their winter habitat, while populations of "ice-avoiding" species have increased. However, 30 y of field studies and recent surveys of penguins throughout the WAP and Scotia Sea demonstrate this mechanism is not controlling penguin populations; populations of both ice-loving Adelie and ice-avoiding chinstrap penguins have declined significantly. We argue in favor of an alternative, more robust hypothesis that attributes both increases and decreases in penguin populations to changes in the abundance of their main prey, Antarctic krill. Unlike many other predators in this region, Adelie and chinstrap penguins were never directly harvested by man; thus, their population trajectories track the impacts of biological and environmental changes in this ecosystem. Linking trends in penguin abundance with trends in krill biomass explains why populations of Adelie and chinstrap penguins increased after competitors (fur seals, baleen whales, and some fishes) were nearly extirpated in the 19th to mid-20th centuries and currently are decreasing in response to climate change.				, Jefferson/AAG-1702-2021	, Jefferson/0000-0002-3600-1414												0027-8424					MAY 3	2011	108	18					7625	7628		10.1073/pnas.1016560108							WOS:000290203100069	21482793

Investigating the use of stable isotope analysis of milk to infer seasonal trends in the diets and foraging habitats of female Antarctic fur seals	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY												The use of intrinsic biomarkers to infer the foraging ecology of marine predators has become a common alternative to traditional methods of estimating diets and foraging behavior. In this study we examined the ability of the stable isotope analysis (delta N-15 and delta C-13) of milk to infer seasonal variations in the diets and foraging habitats of female Antarctic fur seals (Arctocephalus gazella) breeding at Cape Shirreff, Livingston Island, Antarctica. We found that the stable nitrogen values of lipid-free milk were correlated with seasonal changes in female diet composition during the lactation period identified from scat collections. While we could not fully quantifying female diets using isotopic analysis, evidence from both scat collections and stable isotope analysis suggest that Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) remained a major dietary item throughout lactation. In addition, these two methods independently highlighted the increasing importance of fish and squid in the diets of females as the season progresses. Furthermore, the isotopic values of milk collected during the perinatal fast suggest that females may be foraging in high productivity areas north of the South Shetland Islands and consume a larger proportion of fish and/or squid prior to parturition. While more confirmatory studies are needed to refine these methods, our results suggests that the delta N-15 and delta C-13 values of lipid-free milk can be used as a proxy to describe the foraging ecology of female Antarctic fur seals prior to and across the lactation period.

Productivity and linkages of the food web of the southern region of the western Antarctic Peninsula continental shelf	PROGRESS IN OCEANOGRAPHY												The productivity and linkages in the food web of the southern region of the west Antarctic Peninsula continental shelf were investigated using a multi-trophic level mass balance model. Data collected during the Southern Ocean Global Ocean Ecosystem Dynamics field program were combined with data from the literature on the abundance and diet composition of zooplankton, fish, seabirds and marine mammals to calculate energy flows in the food web and to infer the overall food web structure at the annual level. Sensitivity analyses investigated the effects of variability in growth and biomass of Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) and in the biomass of Antarctic krill predators on the structure and energy fluxes in the food web. Scenario simulations provided insights into the potential responses of the food web to a reduced contribution of large phytoplankton (diatom) production to total primary production, and to reduced consumption of primary production by Antarctic krill and mesozooplankton coincident with increased consumption by microzooplankton and salps. Model-derived estimates of primary production were 187-207 g C m(-2) y(-1), which are consistent with observed values (47-351 g C m(-2) y(-1)). Simulations showed that Antarctic krill provide the majority of energy needed to sustain seabird and marine mammal production, thereby exerting a bottom-up control on higher trophic level predators. Energy transfer to top predators via mesozooplanton was a less efficient pathway, and salps were a production loss pathway because little of the primary production they consumed was passed to higher trophic levels. Increased predominance of small phytoplankton (nanoflagellates and cryptophytes) reduced the production of Antarctic krill and of its predators, including seabirds and seals. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Both larvae and adult E. crystallorophias were found in abundance in shelf waters of 100-500 m depth. Maximum abundances of larvae (up to 23,969 ind. 1000 m(-3)) and adults (up to 12,670 ind. 1000 m(-3)) were found in the Prydz Bay region. Size frequency analysis indicated that the generation time was approximate to 3 years in the Indian sector of the Southern Ocean. Total life span of E. crystallorophias may reach 5 years in the Prydz Bay region and 4 years in the Cosmonaut Sea. Analysis of size distribution by sex suggests that male E. crystallorophias may have a shorter life span than females. Growth for only 180 days per year is assumed, mean growth rates ranged from 0.070-0.075 to 0.019-0.022 mm per day during the first and the fourth year, respectively. Von Bertalanffy growth curves calculated for different areas were similar to those obtained in the Antarctic Peninsula region. In the Prydz Bay and the Cosmonaut Sea, spawning of E. crystallorophias appears to peak from the end of November to early December and may extend to the beginning of January. Most larvae were in the stage of metanauplius/calyptopis I at the beginning of January and calyptopis III/furcilia I during February. The year-1 cohort was identified in January-February and exhibited a mean length in the range 10.8-15.8 mm. In situ feeding rates were estimated in the Lazarev Sea using the gut fluorescence method. Ingestion rates during austral summer 1990/91 ranged from 52 to 471 ng (pigm) ind(-1) h(-1) in adults and from 2.5 to 25.2 ng (pigm) ind(-1) h(-1) in calyptopis III larvae. Total population impact on the phytoplankton stock varied between 160-2860 and 215-652 mu g (C) m(-1) day(-1) for adults and larvae, respectively. This is equivalent to 0.06-1.12% and 0.02-0.07% of total daily production. In areas with dense E. crystallorophias swarms, however, daily consumption rates may attain levels as high as 13.6-96.5% of daily primary production. The long-term monitoring of different populations of E. crystallorophias allowed the identification of similar patterns between its abundance and spawning success and the formation of coastal polynyas, especially in the Prydz Bay region.																	0967-0637					JAN	1996	43	1					59	87		10.1016/0967-0637(95)00094-1							WOS:A1996UB14200004

Coastal regions of the northern Antarctic Peninsula are key for gentoo populations	BIOLOGY LETTERS												Southern Ocean ecosystems are rapidly changing due to climate variability. An apparent beneficiary of such change in the western Antarctic Peninsula (WAP) is the gentoo penguin Pygoscelis papua, which has increased its population size and expanded its range southward in the last 20 years. To better understand how this species has responded to large-scale changes, we tracked individuals during the non-breeding winter period from five colonies across the latitudinal range of breeding sites in the WAP, including from a recently established colony. Results highlight latitudinal gradients in movement; strong associations with shallow, coastal habitats along the entire Antarctic Peninsula; and movements that are independent of, yet constrained by, sea ice. It is clear that coastal habitats essential to gentoo penguins during the breeding season are similarly critical during winter. Larger movements of birds from northern colonies in the WAP further suggest that leap-frog migration may influence colonization events by facilitating nest-area prospecting and use of new haul-out sites. Our results support efforts to develop a marine protected area around the WAP. Winter habitats used by gentoo penguins outline high priority areas for improving the management of the spatio-temporally concentrated krill (Euphausia superba) fishery that operates in this region during winter.				, Jefferson/AAG-1702-2021	, Jefferson/0000-0002-3600-1414; Korczak-Abshire, Malgorzata/0000-0001-7695-0588; Juares, Mariana A./0000-0002-6763-0416												1744-9561	1744-957X				JAN 27	2021	17	1							20200708	10.1098/rsbl.2020.0708							WOS:000613728500001	33497589					
J	Wienecke, BC; Robertson, G				Wienecke, BC; Robertson, G			Foraging space of emperor penguins Aptenodytes forsteri in Antarctic shelf waters in winter	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												To determine the foraging space of emperor penguins Aptenodytes forsteri in winter, 12 females from Auster colony (13400 pairs) were equipped with satellite transmitters and time-depth recorders before departing on their 76 +/- 9 d winter (June to August) foraging trip. The females were also injected with tritiated water (HTO) lo estimate food consumption, and non-instrumented females were stomach sampled upon return to the colony to determine their diet. The same data were collected in August/September from 3 males foraging after :heir 4 mo ,prenuptial and incubation fast. Both females and males foraged in pack-ice within 120 km of the colony along a relatively narrow band of the continental shelf in water depths ranging from 200 to 500 m. Only rarely did penguins leave shelf waters to forage in deeper waters over the shelf break. The size of the general foraging area for females was about 11410 km(2), but 50% of all foraging days were spent in only about 15% (1700 km(2)) of the total foraging area. A female of average mass (25 Ig) hunted for about 6 h d(-1), and consumed 1.8 +/- 0.3 kg of food per foraging day. This indicates that females from Auster consumed in winter about 1520 t, about half of which is likely to have been taken from an area measuring only 60 x 28 km. Males were active for about 10 h d(-1) and consumed about twice as much (3.7 +/-: 1.2 kg d(-1) for a 24 kg male) as the females during the early phase of brooding. The diet of females comprised 72% fish (by mass), 16% squid and 12% Antarctic krill Euphausia superba whereas that of the males comprised 53% fish, 2% squid and 43% krill. Most foraging dives of females (81%) and males (64%) were to <200 m and lasted less about 3 min. Males dived deep (>300 m) more frequently than females (19.8% vs 0.1%) but the number of dives per day was similar for both sexes (27 +/- 14 for winter females, 31 +/- 15 for brood-stage males). The small foraging area, diet composition and prey harvest rates of the females provide indirect evidence of the availability of penguin prey species in the pack-ice off Auster in winter.																	0171-8630	1616-1599					1997	159						249	263		10.3354/meps159249							WOS:000071358700023						
J	Ichii, T; Naganobu, M; Ogishima, T				Ichii, T; Naganobu, M; Ogishima, T			Competition between the krill fishery and penguins in the South Shetland Islands	POLAR BIOLOGY												Among the South Shetland Islands, the potential competition for krill (Euphausia superba) between the Japanese fishery and krill-eating breeding penguins was assessed. A low level of competition was apparent due to several factors. Spatial overlap between the main fishing and foraging areas was insignificant. Firstly, the large colonies of the dominant penguin (chinstrap penguins, Pygoscelis antarctica) occurred where sea ice disappears early in spring, and not necessarily where krill are abundant in summer, i.e, the area of krill fishery. Secondly, overlap between trawling depth and foraging dive depth of penguins was marginal, with the latter depth being shallower. Moreover, overlap in the size-frequency of krill caught by trawlers and those captured by penguins was not complete; the penguins took larger krill on average. Finally, the present small fishery is unlikely to impact upon local krill biomass in the region. Krill biomass was estimated to be 250-1500 x 10(3) tonnes within the preferred fishing areas during summer. The present catch rate by the fishery (less than or equal to 13 x 10(3) tonnes/half-month period) is smaller by an order of magnitude, and the fishing area does not include the main foraging areas of breeding penguins.																	0722-4060					JAN	1996	16	1					63	70		10.1007/BF01876830							WOS:A1996TG15500008

Drivers of concentrated predation in an Antarctic marginal-ice-zone food web	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS												Predators impact preyscapes (3-D distribution of forage species) by consuming prey according to their abilities or by altering prey behavior as they avoid being consumed. We elucidate prey (Antarctic silverfish[Pleuragramma antarctica] and crystal krill[Euphausia chrystallorophias]) responses to predation associated with the marginal ice zone (MIZ) of the McMurdo Sound, Antarctica, polynya. Prey abundance and habitat was sampled across a 30 x 15km area by remotely-operated vehicle, and included locations that were accessible (ice edge) or inaccessible (solid fast ice) to air-breathing predators. Prey and habitat sampling coincided with bio-logging of Adelie penguins and observations of other air-breathing predators (penguins, seals, and whales), all of which were competing for the same prey. Adelie penguins dived deeper, and more frequently, near the ice edge. Lowered abundance of krill at the ice edge indicated they were depleted or were responding to increased predation and/or higher light levels along the ice edge. Penguin diet shifted increasingly to silverfish from krill during sampling, and was correlated with the arrival of krill-eating whales. Behaviorally-mediated, high trophic transfer characterizes the McMurdo Sound MIZ, and likely other MIZs, warranting more specific consideration in food web models and conservation efforts.																	2045-2322					APR 29	2020	10	1							7282	10.1038/s41598-020-63875-y							WOS:000560743900002	32350362

POLAR BIOLOGY												Several studies have suggested that penguins are undergoing a major restructuring of their feeding habits and distribution after drastic climatic changes in the Antarctic Peninsula region. With the objective of estimating potential medium-term and inter-annual variations in trophic niche, we measured delta N-15 and delta C-13 in feather samples of pygoscelid penguins from museum specimens (1982-1984) and in blood and feather samples from 2009/10-2011 collected from animals on Ardley Island. Current penguin feathers had lower delta C-13 and delta N-15 values and were more similar to Antarctic krill values, than feathers in 1982-1984 and blood from 2009/10-2011. Moreover, delta C-13 and delta N-15 values from museum feathers and modern samples occupied a larger isotopic space in Gentoo Penguins (Pygoscelis papua), compared to Ad,lie Penguins (Pygoscelis adeliae) and Chinstrap Penguins (Pygoscelis antarctica). Our results from feathers samples indicated that penguins have decreased their consumption of fish and other prey of higher trophic levels in the early interbreeding period (EIBP), while increasing the amount of euphausiids (Antarctic krill Euphausia superba) taken. The isotopic values of the species suggest that foraging sites varied significantly over time and seasonally. We suggest that environmental changes may have modified the feeding habits of pygoscelid penguins, resulting in changed foraging behaviour in the EIBP, and altering the secondary prey consumption. Prey choice in breeding pygoscelid species is probably limited by the foraging range around the breeding colony and competitive exclusion between congeners.

Large copepods were very scarce, similarly to the post-bloom conditions in phytoplankton where large cells are not abundant and small cells such as flagellates dominate the water column. The vertical distribution showed two well defined layers by day, one at the surface which corresponded to krill organisms and a second at depth (> 300 m) formed mainly by the large copepod Metridia gerlachei. During the short night, this layer ascended at the time that krill at the surface migrated to deeper waters as observed from acoustics and net sampling. This observation and the absence of large copepods over the shelf suggest that krill consumption on large phytoplankton cells during the bloom is followed by an increase in predation upon mesozooplankton. It also suggests that krill decrease the abundance and biomass of mesozooplankton over the shelf and continues their predation upon mesopelagic copepods during the post-bloom in Antarctic waters. This behaviour could explain the long ago described impoverishment in mesozooplankton south of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current.

Shapes of Krill Swarms and Fish Schools Emerge as Aggregation Members Avoid Predators and Access Oxygen	CURRENT BIOLOGY												Many types of animals exhibit aggregative behavior: birds flock, bees swarm, fish shoal, and ungulates herd [1]. Terrestrial and aerial aggregations can be observed directly, and photographic techniques have provided insights into the behaviors of animals in these environments [2] and data against which behavioral theory can be tested [3]. Underwater, however, limited visibility can hamper direct observation, and understanding of shoaling remains incomplete. We used multibeam sonar to observe three-dimensional structure of Antarctic krill shoals acoustically [4]. Shoal size and packing density varied greatly, but surface area:volume ratios (roughnesses) were distributed narrowly about similar to 3.3 m(-1) [5]. Shoals of clupeid fish (e.g., sardine, anchovy) from geographically and oceanographically diverse locations have very similar roughnesses [6-8]. This common emergent shape property suggests common driving forces across diverse ecosystems. Group behavior can be complex [9], but a simple tradeoff-that we model-in which individual fish and krill juggle only their access to oxygen-replete water and exposure to predation can explain the observed shoal shape. Decreasing oxygen availability in a warming world ocean [10] may impact shoal structure: because structure affects catchability by predators and fishers [11-13], understanding the response will be necessary for ecological and commercial reasons.

Invertebrate micronekton and macrozooplankton in the Marguerite Bay region of the Western Antarctic Peninsula	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY												Invertebrate micronekton and macrozooplankton in the Marguerite Bay region of the Western Antarctic Peninsula (WAP) were sampled using a 10-m(2) MOCNESS as part of the Southern Ocean Global Ecosystem Dynamics (SO GLOBEC) program. A total of 62 trawls were completed during four separate cruises in the austral fall (April-June) and winter (July-September) of 2001 and 2002. Crustaceans dominated the system in both seasons, accounting for 32 of the 55 species captured in the fall and 30 of the 48 species captured in winter. In both seasons, a very few species made up the majority of the catch. In the fall, the euphausiids Euphausia crystallorophias, Euphausia superba, and Thysanoessa macrura, and the mysid Antarctomysis ohlinii numerically dominated the assemblage, contributing over 85% of the total. In the winter, the same three euphausiids and the chaetognath Pseudosagitta gazellae were the numerical dominants, comprising over 90% of the catch. A significant increase in total abundance and biomass was observed from 2001 to 2002. The invertebrate micronekton/macrozooplankton communities found in the Marguerite Bay region of the WAP were a mixture of oceanic and neritic fauna: a direct result of local hydrographic conditions. Near the shelf break and in the outer reaches of the Marguerite Trough, a deep canyon transecting the shelf in a south-southeast direction, the communities were more diverse, dominated by oceanic species such as Euphausia triacantha, Salpa thompsoni, and Themisto gaudichaudi. The assemblages present in the nearshore fjords exhibited lower diversity and were dominated by neritic species such as E. crystallorophias and A. ohlinii. At the mid-shelf and mid-trough locations, the assemblages were composed of a variable mixture of oceanic and neritic fauna. The faunal mixing and overall species composition in those areas is the result of episodic Circumpolar Deep Water (CDW) intrusions onto the shelf via deep bathymetric features such as the Marguerite Trough. Species diversity and integrated abundance for the upper 200 m of the water column were similar between seasons in the WAP study region, but integrated biomass was nearly three times greater in fall than in winter. Integrated estimates from the WAP study region were similar to those from other studies conducted in the Scotia and Weddell Seas, but were orders of magnitude lower than estimates from a study in Croker Passage, primarily due to a large catch of E. superba. In contrast, species diversity in the WAP was higher than recorded in any of the previously mentioned studies, which is due to the mixing of typical oceanic fauna with endemic nearshore fauna.

The research was conducted in the framework of the ATOS research project as part of the Spanish contribution to the International Polar Year. The objective was to ascertain the possible consequences of the predicted zooplankton shift from krill to salps in the Southern Ocean for the cycling of biogenic carbon and the concentration and stoichiometry of dissolved inorganic nutrients. The carbon respiratory demands and NH4-N and PO4-P excretion rates of <5 mm size copepods, krill and salps were estimated by incubation experiments. The carbon-specific metabolic rates and N:P metabolic quotients of salps were higher than those of krill (furcilia spp. and adults) and copepods, and as expected there was a significant negative relation between average individual zooplankton biomass and their metabolic rates, each metabolic process showing a particular response that lead to different metabolic N:P ratios. The predicted change from krill to salps in the Southern Ocean would encompass not only the substitution of a pivotal group for Antarctic food webs (krill) by one with an indifferent trophic role (salps). In a zooplankton community dominated by salps the respiratory carbon demand by zooplankton will significantly increase, and therefore the proportion of primary production that should be allocated to compensate for the global respiratory C-losses of zooplankton. At the same time, the higher production by salps of larger, faster sinking fecal pellets will increase the sequestration rate of biogenic carbon. Similarly, the higher N and P excretion rates of zooplankton and the changes in the N:P stoichiometry of the metabolic products will modify the concentration and proportion of N and P in the nutrient pool, inducing quantitative and qualitative changes on primary producers that will translate to the whole Southern Ocean ecosystem.

The excretion of protease was maximal at temperatures from 5 to 10 degrees C, i.e. below the temperature optimum for the strain growth (15 degrees C). The highly purified enzyme was a metalloprotease [sensitivity to ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA)] and showed maximal activity against proteins at 20-30 degrees C and pH 6.5-7.0, and towards N-benzoyl-tyrosine ethyl ester (BzTyrOEt) at pH 8.0. At 0 degrees C the enzyme retained as much as 47% of maximal activity in hydrolysis of urea denatured haemoglobin (Hb) (at pH 7.0), and at -5 and -10 degrees C, 37 and 30%, respectively. The metalloprotease was stable up to 30 degrees C for 15 min and up to 20 degrees C for 60 min. These results indicate that the proteinase from S. paucimobilis 116 is a cold-adapted enzyme.

The stomach contents of cape petrel (Daption capense), Antarctic petrel (Thalassoica antarctica), and southern fulmar (Fulmarus glacialoides) were sampled by collecting regurgitates and by stomach flushing during the 1987/88 early chick-rearing period. Pleuragramma antarcticum and Euphausia superba dominated the diets of all species. By mass they constituted 78% and 22% of Antarctic petrel diet, 63% and 36% of southern fulmar diet, and 14% and 85% of cape petrel diet respectively. P. antarcticum increased in importance in the diet of Antarctic petrels during the course of the study, while E. superba became increasingly important in the diets of southern fulmars and cape petrels. Previous studies conducted during incubation consistently reported the diets as comprising chiefly cephalopods and euphausiids, whilst studies during chick-rearing have reported fish and euphausiids dominating, and very little cephalopod material.																	0954-1020					MAR	1991	3	1					19	27		10.1017/S0954102091000056							WOS:A1991FB09900004

The present study demonstrates that TAG compounds, in addition to phospholipids and lysophospholipids, are an important lipid class in pure krill oil. The fatty acid composition of TAG molecules from krill oil and their distribution on the backbone of TAG structures were determined by gas chromatography and liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometric, respectively. The content of omega 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFA) was similar to those reported in the literature for fish oil. It was estimated that 21 % of n-3 PUFA were at the sn-2 position of TAG structures.

The nature of this interaction is poorly understood, particularly during the critical period of winter-spring transition. To investigate the role of sea-ice and underlying water-column properties in structuring under-ice communities during late winter/early spring, we used a Surface and Under Ice Trawl to sample animals and environmental properties in the upper 2-m layer under the sea ice in the northern Weddell Sea from August to October 2013. The area of investigation was largely homogeneous in terms of hydrography and sea-ice coverage. We hypothesised that this apparent homogeneity in the physical regime was mirrored in the structure of the under-ice community. The under-ice community was numerically dominated by the copepods Stephos longipes, Ctenocalanus spp. and Calanus propinquus (altogether 67 %), and furcilia larvae of Antarctic krill Euphausia superba (30 %). In spite of the apparent homogeneity of the environment, abundance and biomass distributions at our sampling stations indicated the presence of three community types, following a geographical gradient in the investigation area: (1) high biomass, krill-dominated in the west, (2) high abundance, copepod-dominated in the east, and (3) low abundance, low biomass at the ice edge. Combined analysis with environmental data indicated that under-ice community structure was correlated with sea-ice coverage, chlorophyll a concentration, and bottom depth. The heterogeneity of the Antarctic under-ice community was probably also driven by other factors, such as advection, sea-ice drift, and seasonal progression. The response of under-ice communities to changing sea-ice habitats may thus considerably vary seasonally and regionally.

J	Andraka, JM; Sharma, N; Marchalant, Y				Andraka, John M.; Sharma, Naveen; Marchalant, Yannick			Can krill oil be of use for counteracting neuroinflammatory processes induced by high fat diet and aging?	NEUROSCIENCE RESEARCH												Most neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease, demonstrate preceding or on-going inflammatory processes. Therefore, discovering effective means of counteracting detrimental inflammatory mediators in the brain could help alter aging-related disease onset and progression. Fish oil and marine-derived omega-3, long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC n-3) have shown promising anti-inflammatory effects both systemically and centrally. More specifically, krill oil (KO), extracted from small Antarctic crustaceans, is an alternative type of LC n-3 with reported health benefits including improvement of spatial memory and learning, memory loss, systemic inflammation and depression symptoms. Similar to the more widely studied fish oil, KO contains the long chain fatty acids eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) which are essential for basic brain functions. Moreover, the phospholipid bound nature of fatty acids found in KO improves bioavailability and efficiency of absorption, thus supporting the belief that KO may offer a superior method of dietary n-3 delivery. Finally, KO contains astaxanthin, an antioxidant capable of reducing potentially excessive oxidative stress and inflammation within the brain. This review will discuss the potential benefits of KO over other marine-based LC n-3 on brain inflammation and cognitive function in the context of high fat diets and aging.

Spatially Explicit Estimates of Prey Consumption Reveal a New Krill Predator in the Southern Ocean	PLOS ONE												Development in foraging behaviour and dietary intake of many vertebrates are age-structured. Differences in feeding ecology may correlate with ontogenetic shifts in dispersal patterns, and therefore affect foraging habitat and resource utilization. Such life-history traits have important implications in interpreting tropho-dynamic linkages. Stable isotope ratios in the whiskers of sub-yearling southern elephant seals (Mirounga leonina; n = 12) were used, in conjunction with satellite telemetry and environmental data, to examine their foraging habitat and diet during their first foraging migration. The trophic position of seals from Macquarie Island (54 degrees 30'S, 158 degrees 57'E) was estimated using stable carbon (delta C-13) and nitrogen (delta N-15) ratios along the length of the whisker, which provided a temporal record of prey intake. Satellite-relayed data loggers provided details on seal movement patterns, which were related to isotopic concentrations along the whisker. Animals fed in waters south of the Polar Front (>60 degrees S) or within Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR) Statistical Subareas 88.1 and 88.2, as indicated by both their depleted delta C-13 (< -20%) values, and tracking data. They predominantly exploited varying proportions of mesopelagic fish and squid, and crustaceans, such as euphausiids, which have not been reported as a prey item for this species. Comparison of isotopic data between sub-yearlings, and 1, 2 and 3 yr olds indicated that sub-yearlings, limited by their size, dive capabilities and prey capture skills to feeding higher in the water column, fed at a lower trophic level than older seals. This is consistent with the consumption of euphausiids and most probably, Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba), which constitute an abundant, easily accessible source of prey in water masses used by this age class of seals. Isotopic assessment and concurrent tracking of seals are successfully used here to identify ontogenetic shifts in broad-scale foraging habitat use and diet preferences in a highly migratory predator.

Ecosystem modelling to quantify the impact of historical whaling on Southern Hemisphere baleen whales	FISH AND FISHERIES												Many baleen whales were commercially harvested during the 20th century almost to extinction. Reliable assessments of how this mass depletion impacted whale populations, and projections of their recovery, are crucial but there are uncertainties regarding the status of Southern Hemisphere whale populations. We developed a Southern Hemisphere spatial Model of Intermediate Complexity for Ecosystem Assessments (MICE) for phytoplankton, krill (Euphausia superba) and five baleen whale species, to estimate whale population trajectories from 1890 to present. To forward project to 2100, we couple the predator-prey model to a global climate model. We used the most up to date catch records, fitted to survey data and accounted for key uncertainties. We predict Antarctic blue (Balaenoptera musculus intermedia), fin (Balaenoptera physalus) and southern right (Eubalaena australis) whales will be at less than half their pre-exploitation numbers (K) even given 100years of future protection from whaling, because of slow growth rates. Some species have benefited greatly from cessation of harvesting, particularly humpbacks (Megaptera novaeangliae), currently at 32% of K, with full recovery predicted by 2050. We highlight spatial differences in the recovery of whale species between oceanic areas, with current estimates of Atlantic/Indian area blue (1,890, <1% of K) and fin (16,950, <4% of K) whales suggesting slower recovery from harvesting, whilst Pacific southern right numbers are <7% of K (2,680). Antarctic minke (Balaenoptera bonaerensis) population trajectories track future expected increases in primary productivity. Population estimates and plausible future predicted trajectories for Southern Hemisphere baleen whales are key requirements for management and conservation.

J	Boyd, IL				Boyd, IL			Foraging and provisioning in Antarctic fur seals: interannual variability in time-energy budgets	BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY												This study examined three competing hypotheses to explain how lactating Antarctic fur seals (Arctocephalus gazella) respond to changes in the level of resource availability. Antarctic fur seals have episodic bouts of suckling (1-3 days), alternating with foraging trips (3-10 days). Foraging time budgets varied significantly (p <.001) among 8 consecutive years at Bird Island, South Georgia. Foraging trip duration increased during periods of relative food shortage. Time spent ashore was more consistent among years than foraging trip duration but declined during a year of particularly low food availability. In 4 of the 8 years, there was a significant positive correlation between time spent ashore and foraging trip duration. In the other years, the relationship was close to statistical significance. Energy delivery to pops during suckling bouts followed an asymptotic power function. Energy gain during foraging trips was estimated from diving behavior, which suggested that the energy gain function was linear. Distance traveled during foraging trips was correlated with foraging trip duration, and long foraging trips were associated with reduced foraging intensity. There was support for the hypothesis that lactating Antarctic fur seals compensate for reduced resources by increasing the foraging trip duration rather than working harder and increasing their energy expenditure. However, there was most support for the hypothesis that lactating Antarctic fur seals adjust time spent ashore as well as foraging trip duration, possibly to maximize the delivery of food to their offspring. Lactation appears to impose constraints on provisioning of offspring that differ from those of seabirds foraging in the same environment and often on the same prey.																	1045-2249	1465-7279				MAR-APR	1999	10	2					198	208		10.1093/beheco/10.2.198							WOS:000079642600013						
J	Smith, C				Smith, Carl			A warming Southern Ocean may compromise Antarctic blue whale foetus growth	JOURNAL OF VERTEBRATE BIOLOGY												After declining in abundance due to commercial whaling during the 20th century, populations of the Antarctic blue whale (Balaenoptera musculus intermedia) have failed to recover to pre-exploitation levels. Using historical whaling data from 1926-1954, in combination with temperature data for the Southern Ocean, a gamma GLM with temporal dependency was fitted to 20,144 records of B. m. intermedia foetus size using Bayesian inference. There was a negative relationship between antecedent winter sea surface temperature (SST) in the Southern Ocean on foetus size. This relationship is proposed as being mediated by a positive effect of the extent of winter sea ice on Antarctic krill (Euphasia superba) abundance on which B. m. intermedia feed. There was also a positive density-dependent effect of a "krill surplus" at low B. m. intermedia population sizes. However, the positive effect of a "krill surplus" at low B. m. intermedia population size on foetus growth was reversed at elevated winter SST due to a proposed negative impact on E. superba recruitment. Projected increases in temperature in the Southern Ocean are predicted to compromise the growth rates of B. m. intermedia foetuses, with implications for the capacity of the subspecies to recover from overexploitation.																	2694-7684					MAR	2021	70	2							20114	10.25225/jvb.20114							WOS:000640645200001

The karyotype of both sexes consists of 19 metacentric chromosome pairs of gradually decreasing size. Silver staining of male mitotic and meiotic metaphase showed, in all chromosomes, centromeric regions that appeared to be related to kinetochores rather than to nucleous-organizer regions. C-banding revealed centromeric constitutive heterochromatin in all chromosomes. No heteromorphic sex differentiation was observed. The karyotype of the krill Meganyctiphanes norvegica is reported here for the first time and will provide a basis for further cytogenetic investigation of species and populations of krill.																	0278-0372	1937-240X				FEB	1995	15	1					79	85		10.2307/1549013							WOS:A1995QG54500004

The following assayes were performed: lipid composition (TLC), fatty acid composition (GC), lipid susceptibility to oxidation, and carotenoids content. The krill harvested in July/August was found to contain about 3% of lipids. The amount of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA; eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic acids) in total lipids of whole krill accounts for 19.0 +/- 1.7% of fatty acids. There was no any lost of n-3 PUFA during processes used to obtain the precipitate and the lipid formula. Euphausia superba is a valuable source of n-3 PUFA, primarily because of their stability in krill.																	0027-769X						1994	38	2					128	134									WOS:A1994NJ48700003						
J	Baena, AMRY; Fowler, SW; Warnau, M				Rodriguez y Baena, Alessia M.; Fowler, Scott W.; Warnau, Michel			Could krill schools significantly bias Th-234-based carbon flux models?	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												To test the recent hypothesis that krill schools and their molting can hinder the accuracy of Th-234-based particle flux models under specific conditions, radiotracer experiments were conducted with northern krill, Meganyctiphanes norvegica, to examine how Th-234 uptake and release kinetics may affect residual 234Th concentrations in seawater. Krill rapidly took up 234Th from seawater, reaching a steady-state concentration factor of similar to 180 in less than 1 week, and strongly retained the accumulated radionuclide until molting occurred. The nine molting events observed during the 18-d experimental period indicated that similar to 50% of krill whole-body Th-234 activity was associated with the cast exoskeleton, and that a corresponding amount was rapidly adsorbed postecdysis on the newly formed cuticle. In regions characterized by the occurrence of high planktonic crustacean biomass, failure to link the presence of organisms with their effects on Th-234 dynamics in the water column may induce significant biases (in some circumstances, up to one order of magnitude) in Th-234-derived particulate organic carbon flux estimations or sediment trap efficiency calculations based on this method. However, because of the patchy distribution of dense aggregations of krill, the overall likelihood of such dramatic modeling artifacts is estimated to be relatively low (<= 5% per sampling time).

Direct measurements of the refractive indices require sections of fresh, unfixed tissue and the use of an interference microscope, but frequently neither is available. Using the eye of the Antarctic krill Euphausia superba (the main food of baleen whales) we developed a computational method to predict a likely refractive index distribution non-invasively from sections of fixed material without the need of an interference microscope. We used a computer model of the eye and calculated the most realistic spatial distribution of the refractive index gradient in the crystalline cone that would enable the eye to produce a sharp image on the retina. The animals are known to see well and on the basis of our computations we predict that for the eyes of the adult a maximum refractive index of 1.45-1.50 in the centre of the cone yields a better angular sensitivity and light absorption in a target receptor of the retina than if N-max were 1.55. In juveniles with a narrower spatial separation between dioptric structures and retina, however, an N-max of 1.50-1.55 gives a superior result. Our method to determine the most likely refractive index distribution in the cone without the need of fresh material and an interference microscope could be useful in the study of other invertebrate eyes that are known to possess good resolving power, but for a variety of reasons are not suitable for or will not permit direct refractive index measurements of their dioptric tissues to be taken.

Effect of continental shelf canyons on phytoplankton biomass and community composition along the western Antarctic Peninsula	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												The western Antarctic Peninsula is experiencing dramatic climate change as warm, wet conditions expand poleward and interact with local physics and topography, causing differential regional effects on the marine ecosystem. At local scales, deep troughs (or canyons) bisect the continental shelf and act as conduits for warm Upper Circumpolar Deep Water, with reduced seasonal sea ice coverage, and provide a reservoir of macro- and micronutrients. Shoreward of many canyon heads are Adelie penguin breeding colonies; it is hypothesized that these locations reflect improved or more predictable access to higher biological productivity overlying the canyons. To synoptically assess the potential impacts of regional bathymetry on the marine ecosystem, 4 major canyons were identified along a latitudinal gradient west of the Antarctic Peninsula using a high-resolution bathymetric database. Biological-physical dynamics above and adjacent to canyons were compared using in situ pigments and satellite-derived sea surface temperature, sea ice and ocean color variables, including chlorophyll a (chl a) and fucoxanthin derived semi-empirically from remote sensing reflectance. Canyons exhibited higher sea surface temperature and reduced sea ice coverage relative to adjacent shelf areas. In situ and satellite-derived pigment patterns indicated increased total phytoplankton and diatom biomass over the canyons (by up to 22 and 35%, respectively), as well as increases in diatom relative abundance (fucoxanthin: chl a). While regional heterogeneity is apparent, canyons appear to support a phytoplankton community that is conducive to both grazing by krill and enhanced vertical export, although it cannot compensate for decreased biomass and diatom relative abundance during low sea ice conditions.

Information on the reproductive status of S. thompsoni in the high Southern Ocean is thus essential to understanding salp population growth and predicting changes in the Southern Ocean ecosystem. We carried out stratified and quantitative sampling from the surface to a depth of 2000 m during the austral summer of 2008 to determine the spatial distribution and population structure of S. thompsoni in the Southern Ocean off Adelie Land. We found two salp species, S. thompsoni and Ihlea racovitzai, with the former being dominant. S. thompsoni was distributed north of the continental slope area, while I. racovitzai was observed in the neritic zone. Mature aggregates and solitary specimens of S. thompsoni were found south of the Southern Boundary of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current, suggesting that S. thompsoni is able to complete its life cycle in high Antarctic waters during the austral summer. However, S. thompsoni was sparsely distributed in the continental slope area, and absent south of the Antarctic Slope Front, suggesting that it is less competitive with krill for food in the slope area off Adelie Land, where krill is densely distributed during the austral summer.

Polychlorinatted biphenyls (PCBs) and organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) were measured in western Antarctic Peninsula continental shelf sediments, porewater, and benthic biota. Concentrations and fluxes in sediments decreased sharply away from the tip of the peninsula toward its interior. Sedimentary PCB fluxes were an order of magnitude lower than reported elsewhere, supporting the notion of a pristiner Antarctic environment. Hexa-chlorinated biphenlys dominated (40-100%) the PCB profiles in the sediments, while trichlorinated biphenyl 28 was the most abundant PCB congener in the porewater. PCB and OCP concentrations in holothurians were comparable to concentrations in the low trophic level biota in Antarctic food web (i.e., krill). The partitioning of PCBs and OCPs between the sediments and porewater can be explained by a dual-mode model, which included both organic carbon and black carbon as partitioning media. Alternatively, a simpler one-parameter prediction assuming coal tar-like organic carbon performed equally well in explaining porewater concentrations. The majorities of PCBs (63-94%) in the Western Antarctic Peninsula sediments were bound to black carbon or recalcitrant tar-like organic carbon, thereby lowering porewater concentrations. PCBs and OCPs in the holothurians were in equilibrium with those in the porewater.

The present study examine the functional biology and evaluate the trophic role of krill in the GodthAyenbsfjord (64 degrees N, 51 degrees W) SW Greenland, through a combination of fieldwork and laboratory experiments. Krill biomass was highest in the middle fjord and inner fjord, whereas no krill was found offshore. The dominating species Thysanoessa raschii revealed a type III functional response when fed with the diatom Thalassiosira weissflogii. At food saturation, T. raschii exhibited a daily ration of 1% body C d(-1). Furthermore, T. raschii was capable of exploiting plankton cells from 5 to 400 mu m, covering several trophic levels of the pelagic food web. The calculated grazing impact by T. raschii on the fjord plankton community was negligible. However, the schooling and migratory behaviour of krill will concentrate and elevate the grazing in specific areas of the euphotic zone.

Climate change and the marine ecosystem of the western Antarctic Peninsula	PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES												The Antarctic Peninsula is experiencing one of the fastest rates of regional climate change on Earth, resulting in the collapse of ice shelves, the retreat of glaciers and the exposure of new terrestrial habitat. In the nearby oceanic system, winter sea ice in the Bellingshausen and Amundsen seas has decreased in extent by 10% per decade, and shortened in seasonal duration. Surface waters have warmed by more than 1 K since the 1950s, and the Circumpolar Deep Water (CDW) of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current has also warmed. Of the changes observed in the marine ecosystem of the western Antarctic Peninsula (WAP) region to date, alterations in winter sea ice dynamics are the most likely to have had a direct impact on the marine fauna, principally through shifts in the extent and timing of habitat for ice-associated biota. Warming of seawater at depths below ca 100 m has yet to reach the levels that are biologically significant. Continued warming, or a change in the frequency of the flooding of CDW onto the WAP continental shelf may, however, induce sublethal effects that influence ecological interactions and hence food-web operation. The best evidence for recent changes in the ecosystem may come from organisms which record aspects of their population dynamics in their skeleton (such as molluscs or brachiopods) or where ecological interactions are preserved (such as in encrusting biota of hard substrata). In addition, a southwards shift of marine isotherms may induce a parallel migration of some taxa similar to that observed on land. The complexity of the Southern Ocean food web and the nonlinear nature of many interactions mean that predictions based on short-term studies of a small number of species are likely to be misleading.

However, little is known about the phytoplankton composition in nearshore waters, in fjords and channels between 63 degrees and 67 degrees S, where Antarctic krill and baleen whales are conspicuous. This study represents the first attempt to describe spatial and temporal composition of the phytoplankton community (species, cell concentration, phytoplankton biomass) in twelve relatively unexplored nearshore sites of the WAP. Sampling was carried out in the frame of a Citizen Science project during late summer of 2016 and during the spring-summer 2016-2017. Species identification and enumeration were performed by light and scanning electron microscopy and phytoplankton carbon biomass was estimated by using cell-volume conversion. The highest phytoplankton abundance and biomass values were found in December-January, and were mainly represented by nanophytoflagellates (2-20 mu m). Cryptophytes were more abundant in early summer and prasinophyceans in late summer. The abundance of large bloom-forming diatoms was unexpectedly low. Three blooming flagellated taxa were found during the sampling season, chronologically: Pyramimonas sp. in Neko Harbor (March 3, 2016, 1.4 x 10(6) cells L-1, and 327 mu gC L-1), cryptophytes in Wilhelmina Bay (December 14, 2016, 6.4 x 10(6) cells L-1, and 97.5 mu gC L-1) and unidentified unarmored dinoflagellates near Danco Island (December 18, 2016, 9.5 x 10(6) cells L-1, and 1597 mu gC L-1). The last one represents, as far as we know, the first record of a dinoflagellate bloom in the WAP. It is to note that blooming organisms, analyzed morphologically, do not coincide with previously described Antarctic species.

This is certainly also applicable to research projects currently being carried out in the antarctic continent, in particular as regards investigations on global change phenomena. Worldwide investments made so far in this field do require in fact that reliability of data be optimized so as to allow for a harmonized assessment of ongoing trends. In this context the Italian National Programme for Research in Antarctica has recently launched a project for the preparation of new multielemental certified reference materials (CRMs) to be used for QC of analyses performed on environmentally significant materials. The suitability of CRMs to verify the accuracy of experimental measurements acknowledgedly depends, among others, on the degree of similarity of their matrix composition and analyte levels to those expected for real samples. From this standpoint three CRMs are planned, namely: i) marine sediment certified for Al, As, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, HE, Mn, Ni, Pb, Sn and Zn; ii) ocean water certified for Cd, Cr, Cu, Fe, Hg, Mn, Ni and Pb; iii) krill certified for As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Fe, Hg, Mn, Ni, Pb, Sn and Zn. Regarding the first two matrices, amounts of ca. 100 kg and ca. 1001, respectively, have been collected during the IX (1993-1994) antarctic expedition, while krill was taken in the course of the X (1994-1995) campaign. The pretreatment of sediment has been accomplished in terms of homogenization, stabilization and characterization of the preliminary ground mass. Approximately 500 bottles, each containing 75 g of material are now ready for distribution to interested laboratories involved in chemical measurements of antarctic matrices, whereas ocean water and krill will follow at a later stage. Finally, depending on circumstances, also the certification of organochlorine compounds in the same materials will be attempted.

From 2011 to 2014 the larval stages geographic distribution and the distribution of water masses were consistent with published information. The densities observed were compared between the cruises and with the 1981 and 1995 values by means of a kernel estimate of absolute and relative densities at a fixed grid of points. The values of Thysanoessa macrura were higher in 2011 and 2012 and those of Euphausia superba were lower than those observed in 1981 and 1995. Euphausia frigida did not show significant variations in absolute density but their relative values were higher than those of E. superba. No significant variations were observed in absolute values between 1981 and 1995. The opposite pattern was found in 2014, with significantly higher densities of E. superba than those of T. macrura. No single factor could be identified to explain these variations in density, suggesting the existence of complex mechanisms coupling the reproductive biology with oceanographic phenomena. Their description will require ample spatial and temporal monitoring rather than locally detailed observations.

Here we examine the role of physical and biological processes in generating fluctuations in the ecosystem around South Georgia in the South Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean. Anomalies in sea surface temperature (SST) in the South Pacific sector of the Southern Ocean have previously been shown to be generated through atmospheric teleconnections with El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO)-related processes. These SST anomalies are propagated via the Antarctic Circumpolar Current into the South Atlantic (on time scales of more than 1 year), where ENSO and Southern Annular Mode-related atmospheric processes have a direct influence on short (less than six months) time scales. We find that across the South Atlantic sector, these changes in SST, and related fluctuations in winter sea ice extent, affect the recruitment and dispersal of Antarctic krill. This oceanographically driven variation in krill population dynamics and abundance in turn affects the breeding success of seabird and marine mammal predators that depend on krill as food. Such propagating anomalies, mediated through physical and trophic interactions, are likely to be an important component of variation in ocean ecosystems and affect responses to longer term change. Population models derived on the basis of these oceanic fluctuations indicate that plausible rates of regional warming of VC over the next 100 years could lead to more than a 95% reduction in the biomass and abundance of krill across the Scotia Sea by the end of the century.

In this study, the effects of subcritical water temperatures (100-180 degrees C) and times (0-10 min) on color changes (L*, a*, and b*) and astaxanthin degradation in Pacific krill were investigated. In addition, an aqueous solution of pure astaxanthin and that of crude astaxanthin from Pacific krill, both at a concentration of 5 mg/L, were subjected to treatment under subcritical water conditions using a flow-type reactor to compare the degradation of free astaxanthin and astaxanthin fatty acid esters. To compare the results of the different treatment conditions on the properties of astaxanthin, the severity factor (log R-0) was calculated, which ranged from 0.38 to 3.52. The extractability of astaxanthin enhanced when the subcritical water treatment was carried out at log R-0 values of 2.00-2.44. In contrast, astaxanthin underwent 50% degradation at log R-0 > 2.44. The changes in the a* values correlated well with the astaxanthin content in the treated krill, while the b* and L* values might relate to the browning components forming owing to Maillard reaction.

J	Loeb, V; Hofmann, EE; Klinck, JM; Holm-Hansen, O				Loeb, Valerie; Hofmann, Eileen E.; Klinck, John M.; Holm-Hansen, Osmund			Hydrographic control of the marine ecosystem in the South Shetland-Elephant Island and Bransfield Strait region	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY												The South Shetland-Elephant Island and Bransfield Strait region of the West Antarctic Peninsula is an important spawning and nursery ground of Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) and is an important source of krill to the Southern Ocean. Krill reproductive and recruitment success, hence supply of krill to predator populations locally and in downstream areas, are extremely variable on interannual and longer time scales. Interannual ecosystem variability in this region has long been recognized and thought related to El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events, but understanding of how has been limited by the hydrographic complexity of the region and lack of appropriate ocean-atmosphere interaction models. This study utilizes multidisciplinary data sets collected in the region from 1990 to 2004 by the U.S. Antarctic Living Marine Resources (AMLR) Program. We focus on hydrographic conditions associated with changes in the distribution, abundance and composition of salp- and copepod-dominated zooplankton assemblages during 1998 and 1999, years characterized respectively by a strong El Nino event and La Nina conditions. We provide detailed analyses of hydrographic, biological and ecological conditions during these dichotomous years in order to identify previously elusive oceanographic processes underlying ecosystem variability. We found that fluctuations between salp-dominated coastal zooplankton assemblages and copepod-dominated oceanic zooplankton assemblages result from the relative influence of Weddell Sea and oceanic waters and that these fluctuations are associated with latitudinal movement of the Southern Antarctic Circumpolar Current Front (sACCf). Latitudinal movements of the sACCf can be explained by meridional atmosphere teleconnections instigated in the western tropical Pacific Ocean by ENSO variability and are consistent with out-of-phase forcing in the South Pacific and South Atlantic Oceans by the Antarctic Dipole high-latitude climate mode. During El Nino decreased northwest winds, equatorward movement of the sACCf and an intensified Weddell Gyre allow Weddell Sea water to flow into eastern Bransfield Strait. During these periods mixing between oceanic and coastal waters is reduced, chlorophyll a concentrations are low, salps numerically dominate the zooplankton, and krill recruitment success is poor. During La Nina increased and more frequent northwest winds and poleward movement of the sACCf allows increased influence of oceanic waters and mixing of these with cold coastal waters. These periods are characterized by numerical dominance of copepods, elevated concentrations of oceanic zooplankton taxa and phytoplankton blooms that promote krill reproduction and recruitment success. Hydrographic and ecological changes after the 1998 El Nino are associated with a shift from frequent El Ninos to the prevalence of La Nina and neutral conditions and conform to a decadal-scale climate regime shift in the Antarctic Peninsula region.

They remain ubiquitously present in the environment today. Here, a unique set of >200 biotic samples from the Antarctic was analyzed for PBDEs, including phytoplankton, krill, fish, and fur seal milk, spanning several sampling seasons over 14 years. PBDE-47 and -99 were the dominant congeners determined in all samples, constituting > 60% of total PBDEs. A temporal trend was observed for Sigma 7PBDE concentrations in fur seal milk, where concentrations significantly increased (R-2 = 0.57, p < 0.05) over time (2000-2014). Results for krill and phytoplankton also suggested increasing PBDE concentrations over time. Trends of PBDEs in fur seal milk of individual seals sampled 1 or more years apart showed no clear temporal trends. Overall, there was no indication of PBDEs decreasing in Antarctic biota yet, whereas numerous studies have reported decreasing trends in the northern hemisphere. Similar PBDE concentrations in perinatal versus nonperinatal milk implied the importance of local PBDE sources for bioaccumulation. These results indicate the need for continued assessment of contaminant trends, such as PBDEs, and their replacements, in Antarctica.

Fluorine accumulation in Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar), Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua), rainbow trout (Onchorhyncus mykiss) and Atlantic halibut (Hippoglossus hippoglossus) fed diets with krill or amphipod meals and fish meal based diets with sodium fluoride (NaF) inclusion	AQUACULTURE												Meals produced from different marine invertebrate species have been suggested as good alternative protein sources in fish diets. The aim of this study was to evaluate the possible uptake of fluorine from krill (Thysanoessa inermis and Euphausia superba) and the amphipod Themisto libelulla in fish fed diets where the fish protein was partly or fully substituted with proteins from krill meal or amphipod meal. Feeding trials with Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar), Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua), rainbow trout (Onchorhyncus mykiss) and Atlantic halibut (Hippoglossus hippoglossus) were carried out, and fluorine were analysed in different organs, including muscle, bone and faeces as well as experimental diets and meals. Ampbipod meal had the highest fluorine level (4000:3800 mg kg(-1)), while meal from Thysanoessa inermis and Euphausia superba showed about one fourth of that level (780 +/- 160 mg kg(-1) and 1160 +/- 230 mg kg(-1), respectively). The fluorine concentration increased in the diets with increasing substitution of fish meal with krill or amphipod meal. Fluorine also increased in faeces with increasing fluorine levels in the diets. None of the analysed organs showed any increase in fluorine concentration compared to the control fish which was fed a diet with only fish meal as protein source. All four species were also fed a fish meal based diet where sodium fluoride (NaF) was added (150 mg F ka(-1) dry wt.). Again no organs showed any increase in fluorine levels. Growth and health parameters were not negatively altered. This indicates that the four fish species, when kept in a marine environment, were not affected by relatively high dietary fluorine level.

Linking predator and prey behaviour: contrasts between Antarctic fur seals and macaroni penguins at South Georgia	MARINE BIOLOGY												Antarctic fur seals Arctocephalus gazella and macaroni penguins Eudyptes chrysolophus are the two main land-based krill Euphausia superba consumers in the northern Scotia Sea. Using a combination of concurrent at-sea (predator observations, net hauls and multi-frequency acoustics), and land-based (animal tracking and diet analysis) techniques, we examined variability in the foraging ecology of these sympatric top predators during the austral summer and autumn of 2004. Krill availability derived from acoustic surveys was low during summer, increasing in autumn. During the breeding season, krill occurred in 80% of fur seal diet samples, with fish remains in 37% of samples. Penguin diets contained the highest proportion of fish in over 20 years of routine monitoring (46% by mass; particularly the myctophid Electrona antarctica), with krill (33%) and amphipods (Themisto gaudichaudii; 21%) also occurring. When constrained by the need to return and feed their offspring both predator species foraged to the northwest of South Georgia, consistent with an area of high macrozooplankton biomass, but fur seals were apparently more successful at exploiting krill. When unconstrained by chick-rearing (during March) penguins foraged close to the Shag Rocks shelf-break, probably exploiting the high daytime biomass of fish in this area. Penguins and seals are able to respond differently to periods of reduced krill abundance (in terms of variability in diet and foraging behaviour), without detriment to the breeding success of either species. This highlights the importance of myctophid fish as an alternative trophic pathway for land-based predators in the Scotia Sea ecosystem.

J	Staniland, IJ; Reid, K; Boyd, IL				Staniland, IJ; Reid, K; Boyd, IL			Comparing individual and spatial influences on foraging behaviour in Antarctic fur seals Arctocephalus gazella	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												We investigated intra-specific and geographic variation in the behaviour of female Antarctic fur seals Arctocephalus gazella by serially sampling 11 individuals throughout their breeding season using satellite tracking, time-depth recorders and radio transmitters. There was significant variation between individuals in trip durations and the maximum distance reached from the breeding beach, but not in the direction of travel. We recognised 4 categories of trip duration, depending on the location of foraging: long deep-location, long intermediate-location, short intermediate-location and short shallow-location, based on the maximum distance reached from the breeding beach and the mean depth of water where diving occurred. Trip category accounted for a greater amount of the variation between trips than the identity of the seal. Seals on long deep-location trips spent proportionally less time diving, had a lower dive rate, and dived to shallower depths for shorter durations with less bottom time than seals on short shallow-location trips. There was no significant difference in the total number of dives within trips between trip categories or between individual seals. There was also no significant difference in either the mean size of krill taken by individual seals or the incidence of fishes in their diet. These data suggest there is a strong individual component to where a seal forages especially in terms of the distance it travels from the breeding beach. However, we suggest that it is where an individual forages, not who that individual is, that determines how it will behave in terms of its diving. While individual seals may exploit areas of previous feeding success, their diving behaviour within these areas is likely to be determined by the spatial and temporal distribution of the prey within them.

Time series of vertical flux of zooplankton fecal pellets on the continental shelf of the western Antarctic Peninsula	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												Zooplankton fecal pellet contribution to particulate organic carbon (POC) flux over the continental shelf of the western Antarctic Peninsula (WAP) was investigated to better understand the possible effects of changes in zooplankton community structure, due to climate change, on carbon export. Fecal pellets were collected at 170 m depth in a moored sediment trap from January 2004 to January 2009. Fecal pellet shape and size (i.e., carbon content) were quantified to assess flux of pellets from different zooplankton taxa and compared between seasons and years. Fecal pellet POC constituted the dominant proportion of total POC flux, with summer (November to April) pellet POC flux (67%) significantly higher than winter (May to October) pellet POC flux (34%), while phytodetritus or fecal 'fluff' constituted the remainder. Cylindrical euphausiid pellets contributed to a monthly mean of 72% of total fecal pellet flux; ovoid copepod and tabular salp pellets contributed significantly less (22 and 6%, respectively). Cylindrical and ovoid pellet export was significantly higher in summer, while 48% of tabular pellet flux occurred in winter. Tabular pellets had the highest carbon content (median = 1.03 mu gC pellet(-1), highest 134.9 mu gC pellet(-1)), followed by cylindrical (0.20 mu gC pellet(-1)) and ovoid (0.04 mu gC pellet(-1)) pellets. As krill fecal pellets are the dominant component of particle export in the WAP, we hypothesize that a decrease in krill and increase in salps in the region could alter the export of POC to the deep sea.

The distribution, length-frequency and summer diet are described from 14 bottom trawl surveys undertaken in the summers between 1986 and 2006. Pseudochaenichthys georgianus (50-590 mm TL) were caught throughout the South Georgia shelf from depths of 76-370 m, but very few specimens (< 1%) were caught on the Shag Rocks shelf. Multiple cohorts were present during each survey and length-frequency analysis of these cohorts suggests that growth is fast during the first 3-4 years. Stomach contents analysis (2005 & 2006) indicated that P. georgianus is a pelagic or semi pelagic predator, with the summer diet dominated by Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba). Fish (channichthyids and notothenids) were also taken, but were a relatively minor part of the diet.				, Martin/ABE-6728-2020; Collins, Martin A/J-8560-2017; Reid, William/J-8528-2013	Reid, William/0000-0003-0190-0425												0954-1020	1365-2079				AUG	2008	20	4					343	353		10.1017/S0954102008000990							WOS:000257842500005

The uptake and depuration kinetics of ingested microplastics for many marine species still remain unknown despite its importance for understanding bioaccumulation potential to higher trophic level consumers. In this study, Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) were exposed to polyethylene microplastics to quantify acute toxicity and ingestion kinetics, providing insight into the bioaccumulation potential of micro plastics at the first-order consumer level. In the 10 day acute toxicity assay, no mortality or dose-dependent weight loss occurred in exposed krill, at any of the exposure concentrations (0, 10, 20, 40, or 80% plastic diet). Krill exposed to a 20% plastic diet for 24 h displayed fast uptake (22 ng mg(-1) h(-1)) and depuration (0.22 h(-1)) rates, but plastic uptake did not reach steady state. Efficient elimination also resulted in no bioaccumulation over an extended 25 day assay, with most individuals completely eliminating their microplastic burden in less than 5 days post exposure. Our results support recent findings of limited acute toxicity of ingested microplastics at this trophic level, and suggest sublethal chronic end points should be the focus of further ecotoxicological investigation.

On the interannual variability of ocean temperatures around South Georgia, Southern Ocean: Forcing by El Nino/Southern Oscillation and the Southern Annular Mode	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY												The ocean around South Georgia, in the southwest Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean, is highly productive, with large stocks of Antarctic krill supporting extensive colonies of marine- and land-based predators. The operation of this ecosystem is strongly influenced by physical forcings, and the role of the El Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) phenomenon has been highlighted previously. Here we examine in detail the transmission of ENSO signals to South Georgia, and investigate other sources of interannual variability. ENSO variability generates anomalies in sea-surface temperature (SST) across the South Pacific via atmospheric teleconnections. These anomalies are advected toward South Georgia within the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC), and previous studies have focussed on long-period advection (order of 2-3 years) from the southwest Pacific. We observe here, however, that the region close to the Antarctic Peninsula in the southeast Pacific is especially susceptible to ENSO forcing via anomalous meridional winds; this induces SST anomalies that are advected to South Georgia on a much more rapid timescale (order 5-6 months). The phasing of these teleconnections is such that anomalies that reach the southeast Pacific from farther west tend to be reinforced here by air-sea-ice interaction. We also find an important role for the Southern Annular Mode (SAM) in determining SST variability at South Georgia. This is a circumpolar mode of climate variability, and thus can readily influence local SST at South Georgia directly. The SAM is, however, not perfectly zonally symmetric, and (like ENSO) has a particular impact on meridional winds in the southeast Pacific. The average timescale for SAM influence on South Georgia SST is shorter than that of ENSO, since it includes a stronger component of direct local forcing. The South Georgia ecosystem is not self-sustaining, with import of krill from breeding and nursery grounds upstream in the ACC being important. We speculate here that these varying meridional winds close to the Antarctic Peninsula play a direct role in promoting/ restricting the injection of shelf waters (and the krill therein) into the ACC, following which anomalies in krill density would be advected toward South Georgia. This offers a dynamical mechanism that might contribute to interannual changes in biological communities at South Georgia, in addition to existing theories. Both SAM and ENSO have shown long-period changes in recent decades, with ENSO exhibiting a higher preponderance of El Nino events compared with La Nina events, and the SAM showing a marked trend toward a higher index state. Such long-period behaviour is likely to induce changes in the South Georgia ecosystem via their impacts on advection and SST, for which an understanding of the physical mechanisms elucidated here will be key to unravelling.

Overall, fish and krill, followed by penguins and squids, were the most frequent prey and constituted the bulk of the diet. The importance of the remaining taxa represented in the samples (octopods, gastropods, bivalves, isopods, polychaetes and poriferans) was negligible. Among fish, channichthyids constituted the bulk of the diet, with Chionodraco rastrospinosus and Chaenodraco wilsoni, followed by the nototheniid, Pleuragramma antarcticum, being the main prey. The myctophid, Electrona antarctica, was the most frequent and numerous fish prey. The results are discussed and compared with those reported for the South Shetland Islands, the closest area for which similar information is available.																	0722-4060					JAN	2003	26	1					49	54		10.1007/s00300-002-0442-3							WOS:000180536100008

On each individual, different measurements were taken, a differentiation index was calculated, and lipids and carotenoids analysed; the data were processed by principal component analysis (PCA). In Euphausia superba the analysis of six morphometric characteristics shows a separation into two groups for the males, but not for females. The analysis of a larger sample, using only four variables, shows an analogous, though less marked separation, suggesting a morphological evolution linked with age. When biochemical data were added, PCA shows a good separation into two groups for both males and females, and the same result was obtained using only the biochemical data and the differentiation index. No possible age groups, other than juveniles and adult males and females, could be identified by PCA for Thysanoessa macrura.																	0198-0149					JUL	1991	38	7					771	779		10.1016/0198-0149(91)90018-B							WOS:A1991GE93900002

Both transects were characterized by a steep thermocline that on approaching the coastline defined the Antarctic Slope Front, The front acted as a strong boundary in the shelf-slope and caused a pronounced cross frontal gradient in the populations of cnidarians. Few species and low abundances were found in the upper cold waters and most of the populations concentrated in and below the thermocline, The analysis of the gastrozooids of the physonect siphonophore Pyrostephos vanhoeffeni showed a wide variety of prey but the relatively high contribution of krill larvae reveals a substantial trophic impact when both organisms co-occur.																	0924-7963					DEC	1996	9	3-4					231	248		10.1016/S0924-7963(96)00047-4							WOS:A1996WE06600007

Ice algae and pelagic phytoplankton represent the primary sources of nutrition for higher trophic-level organisms in seasonally ice-covered areas, but their relative contributions to polar marine consumers remain largely unexplored. Here, we investigated the potential of diatom-specific lipid markers and highly branched isoprenoids (HBIs) for estimating the importance of these two carbon pools in an Antarctic pelagic ecosystem. Using GC-MS analysis, we studied HBI biomarkers in key marine species over three years in Adelie Land, Antarctica: euphausiids (ice krill Euphausia crystallorophias and Antarctic krill E. superba), fish (bald notothens Pagothenia borchgrevinki and Antarctic silverfish Pleuragramma antarcticum) and seabirds (Adelie penguins Pygoscelis adeliae, snow petrels Pagodroma nivea and cape petrels Daption capense). This study provides the first evidence of the incorporation of HBI lipids in Antarctic pelagic consumers. Specifically, a di-unsaturated HBI (diene) of sea ice origin was more abundant in ice-associated species than in pelagic species, whereas a tri-unsaturated HBI (triene) of phytoplanktonic origin was more abundant in pelagic species than in ice-associated species. Moreover, the relative abundances of diene and triene in seabird tissues and eggs were higher during a year of good sea ice conditions than in a year of poor ice conditions. In turn, the higher contribution of ice algal derived organic matter to the diet of seabirds was related to earlier breeding and higher breeding success. HBI biomarkers are a promising tool for estimating the contribution of organic matter derived from ice algae in pelagic consumers from Antarctica.

Advancing the Sea Ice Hypothesis: Trophic Interactions Among Breeding Pygoscelis Penguins With Divergent Population Trends Throughout the Western Antarctic Peninsula	FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE												We evaluated annual and regional variation in the dietary niche of Pygoscelis penguins including the sea ice-obligate Adelie penguin (Pygoscelis adeliae), and sea ice-intolerant chinstrap (Pygoscelis antarcticus) and gentoo (Pygoscelis papua) penguins, three species that nest throughout the western Antarctic Peninsula (AP) to test the sea ice trophic interaction hypothesis, which posits that penguin breeding populations with divergent trends, i.e., declining or increasing, are reliant on differing food webs. Our study relies on values of naturally occurring carbon (C-13/C-12, delta C-13) and nitrogen (N-15/N-14, delta N-15) stable isotopes as integrated proxies of penguin food webs measured over three years at three different breeding colonies. At Anvers Island in the north, where reductions in sea ice and changes in breeding population trends among sympatric sea ice-obligate (Adelie) and sea ice-intolerant (chinstrap and gentoo) penguins have been most notable, our analyses show that all three species of Pygoscelis penguins became more similar isotopically over the reproductive period. By late chick-rearing at Anvers Island, creched chicks at 5-weeks-old for all species occupied similar trophic positions. Isotopic mixing models indicated that the proportions of prey provisioned by adult penguins to 5-week-old chicks at Anvers Island were generally similar across species within years, consisting primarily of Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba). Creched Adelie chicks had higher delta C-13 and delta N-15 values at Avian and Charcot Islands, southern breeding colonies where sea ice is more prominent and populations of Adelie penguins have increased or remain stable. Trophic position increased with latitude, while the proportions of prey provisioned by Adelie penguin adults to chicks at southern breeding colonies included species typical of high Antarctic marine food webs, especially crystal krill (Euphausia crystallorophias). A Bayesian metric for dietary niche width, standard ellipse area (SEA-B), indicated that Pygoscelis penguins with greater population changes in the north had more variability in dietary niche width than stable populations further south. Our results lend insight on marine food web drivers of Pygoscelis penguin reproduction at the regional scale and question the long-standing paradigm that Antarctic krill are the only food web component critical to penguin reproductive survival in this region of the Southern Ocean.</p>					Gorman, Kristen B./0000-0002-0258-9264													2296-7745				SEP 8	2021	8								526092	10.3389/fmars.2021.526092							WOS:000697678100001

Dominant herbivorous macrozooplankton of this region, the Antarctic krill Euphausia superba and the tunicate Salpa thompsoni, were used in shipboard incubation experiments. The concentration of DMSPd + DMS increased in the water during incubation with krill. The production rate was 2.96 +/- 2.78 nmol DMSPd + DMS.krill(-1.)h(-1) (mean +/- SD). In addition, the DMSPd + DMS production rate was linearly related to the ingestion rate of krill (r(2) = 0.664, p less than or equal to 0.01). Addition of salps to natural surface water, however, did not change the DMSPd + DMS concentrations. During the experiments, both animals fed on phytoplankton cells. The fecal pellets of krill contained broken phytoplankton cells, whereas those of salps contained unbroken cells. These results suggest that sloppy feeding by krill is a more likely mechanism for producing DMS and DMSPd than the direct ingestion of phytoplankton cells by salps. The decrease of DMS concentrations in the upper 200 m of the water column from January to February may be explained, in part, by changes in the composition of the macrozooplankton community.

The 18S profiles of diet and pellets from both species do not match the planktonic profile, suggesting that both are selective grazers with a similar diet. Over the past decades, two key grazers in the Southern Ocean (SO), krill and salps, have experienced drastic changes in their distribution and abundance, leading to increasing overlap of their habitats. Both species occupy different ecological niches and long-term shifts in their distributions are expected to have cascading effects on the SO ecosystem. However, studies directly comparing krill and salps are lacking. Here, we provide a direct comparison of the diet and fecal pellet composition of krill and salps using 18S metabarcoding and fatty acid markers. Neither species' diet reflected the composition of the plankton community, suggesting that in contrast to the accepted paradigm, not only krill but also salps are selective feeders. Moreover, we found that krill and salps had broadly similar diets, potentially enhancing the competition between both species. This could be augmented by salps' ability to rapidly reproduce in favorable conditions, posing further risks to krill populations.

Antarctic petrels 'on the ice rocks': wintering strategy of an Antarctic seabird	ROYAL SOCIETY OPEN SCIENCE												There is a paucity of information on the foraging ecology, especially individual use of sea-ice features and icebergs, over the non-breeding season in many seabird species. Using geolocators and stable isotopes, we defined the movements, distribution and diet of adult Antarctic petrels Thalassoica antarctica from the largest known breeding colony, the inland Svarthamaren, Antarctica. More specifically, we examined how sea-ice concentration and free-drifting icebergs affect the distribution of Antarctic petrels. After breeding, birds moved north to the marginal ice zone (MIZ) in the Weddell sector of the Southern Ocean, following its northward extension during freeze-up in April, and they wintered there in April-August. There, the birds stayed predominantly out of the water (60-80% of the time) suggesting they use icebergs as platforms to stand on and/or to rest. Feather delta N-15 values encompassed one full trophic level, indicating that birds fed on various proportions of crustaceans and fish/squid, most likely Antarctic krill Euphausia superba and the myctophid fish Electrona antarctica and/or the squid Psychroteuthis glacialis. Birds showed strong affinity for the open waters of the northern boundary of the MIZ, an important iceberg transit area, which offers roosting opportunities and rich prey fields. The strong association of Antarctic petrels with sea-ice cycle and icebergs suggests the species can serve, year-round, as a sentinel of environmental changes for this remote region.

We examined the effects of various diets on the fatty acid composition of larval, juvenile, and adult E. superba collected in April 1999 in the southwest Lazarev Sea and in April 2001 in the Bellingshausen Sea. Specimens were fed four different diets (mixed phytoplankton, mixed ice algae, the ice diatom Fragilariopsis cylindrus, and mixed copepod assemblages) or starved for up to 44 d. Total lipid content, lipid classes, and fatty acid composition showed very little variation in juvenile and adult krill with the different feeding regimes. Furcilia lipids were much more strongly influenced by the fatty acid signatures of their food. No stage-specific food preferences were detected in the larvae, and spatial patterns were mirrored by all furcilia stages. Comparison of the fatty acid profiles of the offered food with those of the subsequently excreted feces indicated preferential assimilation of polyunsaturated fatty acids by E superba.

J	Frazer, TK				Frazer, TK			Stable isotope composition (delta C-13 and delta N-15) of larval krill, Euphausia superba, and two of its potential food sources in winter	JOURNAL OF PLANKTON RESEARCH												Natural abundances of C-13 (delta(13)C) and N-15 (delta(15)N) were measured in larval krill (Euphausia superba), suspended particulate organic matter (POM) and ice associated POM during early and late winter along the west coast of the Antarctic Peninsula. Larval krill were enriched in C-13 (delta(13)C greater than or equal to 27 parts per thousand) relative to both larvae and adults sampled during summer months (delta(13)C generally less than or equal to 27 parts per thousand). Elevated delta(13)C values were also recorded in suspended POM (delta(13)C greater than or equal to 21 parts per thousand) during early winter. These data imply that (i) seasonal shifts in the isotopic composition of larval krill need not result from changes in diet and (ii) mechanisms other than CO2 limitation in the ice can account for C-13 enrichments in ice-associated POM. Stable carbon isotopes could not be used, in this study, to discern between suspended POM and ice-associated POM as alternative food sources for larval krill. During one early winter sampling period, larval krill were markedly depleted in N-15 (delta(15)N < 1 parts per thousand), suggesting that they are primarily herbivorous prior to exploiting ice-associated food resources. Mechanisms are proposed to explain variation in the isotopic composition of POM and larval krill, and will be of particular interest to those investigating food web dynamics and biogeochemical processes in the region.																	0142-7873					AUG	1996	18	8					1413	1426		10.1093/plankt/18.8.1413							WOS:A1996VE80800010

In spite of their abundance and important role in Antarctic food chains, very little is known of many ecological and biological aspects of this species. A combined trawl and acoustic survey of silverfish was carried out on the western Ross Sea shelf during the New Zealand International Polar Year Census of Antarctic Marine Life research voyage on R.V. Tangaroa in February-March 2008. Multi-frequency acoustic data (12, 38, 70, and 120 kHz) allowed discrimination of silverfish marks from those of krill and other associated species. Mark identification was achieved using targeted midwater trawls. Additional midwater and demersal trawls were carried out at randomly selected locations over the shelf as part of the core biodiversity survey. Silverfish were widely distributed over the Ross Sea shelf. Adult silverfish tended to form layers at 100-400 m depth and were sometimes present close to the bottom, where they were frequently caught in demersal trawls shallower than 500 m. A weak layer at about 80 m depth was associated with juvenile silverfish of 50-80 mm standard length. Acoustic backscatter strength from both silverfish and krill marks increased with increasing frequency (i.e., was highest at 120 kHz), which is characteristic of species without an air-filled swimbladder. Acoustic target strengths (TS) for silverfish at 12, 18, 38, 70, and 120 kHz were estimated from anatomically detailed scattering models based on computed tomography (CT) scans of frozen specimens. The relationship between TS and fish length at 38 kHz was sensitive to estimates of density and sound speed contrast within the fish, especially for small specimens (less than 110 mm SL). Our best estimate of the acoustic biomass of silverfish in the study area was 592 000 t (95% confidence interval 326 000-866 000 t). However, the biomass of juvenile silverfish was highly uncertain due to large differences between TS model results. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The composition of the diet was diverse, with both pelagic and benthic-demersal prey represented in the samples. Antarctic krill Euphausia superba was the most frequent and numerous prey at all the study sites except at Cierva Point, followed by fish, penguins and cephalopods. Antarctic krill also predominated by mass, followed by either fish or penguins. Fish were the second most important prey by mass at the Antarctic Peninsula whereas penguins were the second most important prey by mass at the South Shetland and South Orkney Islands. Among fish, Pleuragramma antarcticum was the most important species in the diet of the Antarctic fur seals at the Antarctic Peninsula whereas Gymnoscopelus nicholsi predominated at the South Shetland and South Orkney Islands.

The isotopic niche is reflected by the ecological position and functional role of a species, which can be altered depending on these environmental changes. We assessed the isotopic niche and trophic positions (TP) of 3 seabirds on the Barton Peninsula, King George Island, Antarctica, to understand ecological interaction among the species. The average TP of Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) (hereafter "krill") (2.6 +/- 0.1) was estimated by using the compiled published data of the compound-specific nitrogen isotope ratio of glutamic acid and phenylalanine in the Southern Ocean, and TP values of the seabirds based on that of krill to be reliable according to ecological knowledge. Our results on the overlap of the isotopic niches of seabirds suggests potential diet competition among the consumers, such as the brown skua (Stercorarius antarcticus) and south polar skua (Stercorarius maccormicki), whereas the distinct and broad isotopic niche width of kelp gulls (Larus dominicanus) suggesting that their adaptation through generalization was related to their extended habitat and various food sources. Our research indicates that isotopic niche of seabirds reflects their survival strategy for food competition. Consequently, these seabirds can be easily influenced by alternative food sources, including terrestrial and human-derived sources, by rapid environmental changes, indicating that they are valuable as key environmental species and require long-term monitoring in the Antarctic Peninsula.																	0272-7714	1096-0015				SEP 5	2021	258								107443	10.1016/j.ecss.2021.107443							WOS:000679383300001

The present study was carried out to explore the possible beneficial effects of oil from Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) as an alternative source of omega-3 lipids. Weanling B/W mice were fed a nutritionally adequate semipurified diet supplemented with either 10% (wt/wt) krill oil (KO) or corn oil (CO). Cross-sectional studies were carried out on kidneys and spleens at 3.5 and 6.5 months of age. Our results indicate that KO prolonged life span (CO, 266.7 days +/- 12.5; KO, 330.2 days +/- 19.2; P < 0.001) and delayed the onset of proteinuria. Splenocytes from KO mice displayed greater proliferative responses to mitogen (concavalin A), and significantly lower Pgp-1(+) cells in both CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cell subsets. Lipid extracts of splenocytes from KO fed mice revealed higher levels of eicosapentaenoic (20:5 omega-3; EPA) and docosahexaenoic (22:6 omega-3; DHA) acids; EPA suppresses prostaglandin synthesis. Further, Northern blot analysis showed decreased expression of the oncogene c-ras (1.5-fold, P < 0.05) in the spleens of KO fed mice. The expression of transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF beta 1) was higher in spleen cell extracts (3.5-fold; P < 0.025), but lower in kidney extracts (5.97 fold; P < 0.025) of KO fed mice. The data indicate that dietary supplementation with KO modulates expression of TGF beta in an organ specific manner. In the spleen, TGF beta could be immunosuppressive, whereas its expression in the kidney may be pathological and proinflammatory. In summary, dietary KO, like fish oil, can suppress the development of autoimmune murine lupus, and its effects on inflammatory mediators are organ specific.																	0271-5317					MAR	1996	16	3					489	503		10.1016/0271-5317(96)00030-9							WOS:A1996UB31100013

The experiments were made to test the hypothesis, that characteristic frequencies in the turbulent propulsion flow produced by swimming shrimp render this flow a communication signal among conspecifics. The range has been measured over which the specificity of the flow signal is preserved. In Euphausia superba the characteristic frequency was preserved over a distance more than 16 cm from the source. The shrimps Metapenaeus intermedius and Crangon crangon did not produce significant flow. The characteristic frequency was detectable only directly at the pleopods and not beyond 1.5 cm from the source. In contrast, Euphausia superba moves the swimmerets in a highly coordinated manner producing strong flow carrying a characteristic turbulence through a considerable distance. It results from the beat frequency of swimmerets and we suppose that it is useful in grouping individuals into schools and in the control of formation swimming.																	0944-2006						1996	99	3					163	174									WOS:A1996VW38800002

Beneath clear waters on the outer Norwegian shelf (about 300 m depth), mesopelagic fish (Maurolicus muelleri) were located at approximately 150 to 200 m by day. Krill (mainly Thysanoessa inermis) was primarily found below the mesopelagic fish and above planktivorous demersal fish (Norway pout Trisopterus esmarkii). The vertical distributions changed abruptly across a front into water with less Light penetration associated with increased fluorescence (chlorophyll a). Mesopelagic fish ascended by about 100 m accompanied by a rise of krill. Demersal fish left the benthic boundary zone, with ascending Norway pout foraging in the lower part of the krill layer. We suggest that the intermediate light conditions inside the front provided an 'antipredation window' (sensu Clark & Levy 1988: Am Nat 131:271-290) and thereby favorable feeding conditions for the planktivore. These results indicate that properties of upper layers may impact plankton and fish distributions and their predator-prey interactions throughout the water column on continental shelves.

Histophagous ciliate Pseudocollinia brintoni and bacterial assemblage interaction with krill Nyctiphanes simplex. II. Host responses	DISEASES OF AQUATIC ORGANISMS												Unlike decapod crustaceans of commercial interest, the krill defense system and its response to parasites and pathogens is virtually unknown. Histophagous ciliates of the genus Pseudocollinia interact with at least 7 krill species in the northeastern Pacific. Although they can cause epizootic events, the physiology of the histophagous ciliate-host interaction and krill (host) defenses remain unknown. From 1 oceanographic survey along the southwestern coast of the Baja California Peninsula near Bahia Magdalena and 2 in the Gulf of California, we investigated parasitoid-host physiological responses (fatty acid and oxidative stress indicators) of the subtropical krill Nyctiphanes simplex infected with the ciliate P. brintoni. All life stages of P. brintoni were associated with opportunistic bacterial assemblages that have not been explicitly investigated in other Pseudocollinia species (P. beringensis, P. oregonensis, and P. similis). Parasitoid ciliates exclusively infected adult females, which showed increased lipid content during gonad development. As the infection progressed, omega-3 eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic fatty acids, which may act as energy sources to produce high numbers of ciliate transmission stages, were quickly depleted. Antioxidant enzymes, components of the crustacean defense system, varied throughout infection, but without inhibiting Pseudocollinia infection, i.e. higher levels of lipid oxidative damage were detected in late stages of infection. The ineffective response of the krill antioxidant defense system against histophagous ciliates and the bacteria associated with the ciliates suggests that Pseudocollinia ciliates are functionally analogous to krill predators and may have a strong influence on the population dynamics of krill.

Because the species frequents the edges of ice packs in summer, the potential impact of long-term physical environmental changes poses serious conservation concerns. Condition along the ice edge vary regionally, sometimes forming small ice free areas (ice gaps), and little is known about whale movement patterns associated with these small-scale variations in the physical environment. In this study, six minke whales were tracked for an average of 31 days (range 4-77 days) from January to March of 2016 and 2017 between 60 degrees E and 140 degrees E above and off the continental shelf. The tracking data of five animals were fitted to a Bayesian hierarchical switching state-space model assembled from ARGOS data filters to estimate behavioral states. Results show that Antarctic minke whales are likely to search for ice gaps areas and remain there for extended periods until the surrounding ice melts, rather than stay at krill rich shelf breaks or areas with high chlorophyll-a concentration. When no ice gaps were nearby, the whales were likely to move eastward along highly concentrated ice packs to find a gap. Our study found a strong association between minke whale movements and ice dynamics during the summer foraging season in this region.

J	Constable, AJ; Nicol, S; Strutton, PG				Constable, AJ; Nicol, S; Strutton, PG			Southern Ocean productivity in relation to spatial and temporal variation in the physical environment	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS												[1] The physical factors that have been reported to affect primary and secondary production in the Southern Ocean are examined and critically reviewed. Long time series of physical measurements from the Southern Ocean are available and there is a theoretical base from which models can be constructed. In contrast, there are few large-scale measurements of biological parameters and a paucity of long-term biological data sets for the Antarctic region. The absence of predictive models for the biological systems of the region is underpinned by the absence of theoretical understanding of the variations in the physical environment and their effects on primary, secondary, or tertiary production. To further this understanding, we have examined some of the major seasonal and interannual physical data available for the region (sea ice extent and retreat rate, wind stress, and surface ocean circulation patterns) and have examined their relationship to spatial and temporal variation in satellite-derived proxies of primary productivity (Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS) ocean color data). The results indicate that there are regional differences in the dominant physical forcings and that simple models will fail to replicate the observed patterns of primary production. We have also used the dynamics of Antarctic krill in the South Atlantic as an example to develop a model and explore the various hypotheses that have been put forward to explain interannual variability in this region. Results from this model indicate that the physical system may change in ways that cause periodic shifts in the relative importance of the factors that affect secondary production. The implications for the design of future research programs are explored.

A systematic sampling grid covering an area of 1319 km(2) was visited eight times. Fish echoes were separated from krill echoes using the difference in backscattering strength at the two frequencies. Global estimates were obtained from geostatistical methods for both total biomass and the fraction exceeding 5 g wet m(-3). The euphausiids were always exclusively composed of individuals of the oldest cohorts (2+) of the two species Thysanoessa raschi and Meganyctiphanes nonvegica. Total biomass varied from 8 +/- 2 to 96 +/- 8 kt and cutoff biomass from 0 to 56 +/- 6 kt. The two types of estimates were linearly related. Biomass was autocorrelated up to distances of 10-15 km. An anisotropic structure with radii of similar to 2 x 5 km, stretched along the channel axis, was discernible at a small scale. The particular size distribution of euphausiids and the large variations in the global estimates appear to be controlled by horizontal transport. The study area appears to be the richest krill aggregation site yet documented in the northwest Atlantic, with densities similar to the rich krill aggregation areas of the Antarctic. The krill aggregation is at the heart of this traditional whale feeding ground.

J	Boyd, IL				Boyd, IL			Estimating food consumption of marine predators: Antarctic fur seals and macaroni penguins	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY												1. Estimating food consumption is central to defining the ecological role of marine predators. This study developed an algorithm for synthesizing information about physiology, metabolism, growth, diet, life history and the activity budgets of marine predators to estimate population energy requirements and food consumption. 2. Two species of marine predators (Antarctic fur seal Arctocephalus gazella and macaroni penguin Eudyptes chrsolophus) that feed on krill in the Southern Ocean were used as examples to test the algorithm. A sensitivity analysis showed that estimates of prey consumed were most sensitive to uncertainty in some demographic variables, particularly the annual survival rate and total offspring production. Uncertainty in the measurement of metabolic rate led to a positive bias in the mean amount of food consumed. Uncertainty in most other variables had little influence on the estimated food consumed. 3. Assuming a diet mainly of krill Euphausia superba, annual food consumption by Antarctic fur seals and macaroni penguins at the island of South Georgia was 3.84 [coefficient of variation (CV) = 0.11] and 8.08 (CV = 0.23) million tonnes, respectively. This was equivalent to a total annual carbon consumption of 0.35 (CV 0.11) and 0.72 (CV = 0.23) G tonnes year(1). Carbon expired as CO2 was 0.26 (CV 0.06) and 0.65 (CV = 0.19) G tonnes year(1) for fur seals and macaroni penguins, respectively. The per capita food consumption varied depending upon sex and age but, overall, this was 1.7 (CV = 0.22) tonnes year(1) for Antarctic fur seals and 0.45 (CV = 0.22) tonnes year for macaroni penguins. 4. The algorithm showed that the seasonal demand for food peaked in both species in the second half of the breeding season and, for macaroni penguins, there was a second peak immediately after moult. Minimum food demand occurred in both species during the first half of the breeding season. 5. As both Antarctic fur seals and macaroni penguins compete for krill with a commercial fishery, these results provide an insight into the seasons and stages of the life cycle in which competition is likely to be greatest.																	0021-8901					FEB	2002	39	1					103	119		10.1046/j.1365-2664.2002.00697.x							WOS:000174307300010						
J	Dahood, A; Klein, ES; Watters, GM				Dahood, Adrian; Klein, Emily S.; Watters, George M.			Planning for success: Leveraging two ecosystem models to support development of an Antarctic marine protected area	MARINE POLICY												Efforts are underway to forward a marine protected area (MPA) in the Western Antarctic Peninsula, guided by an internationally agreed framework of protected area objectives. Preliminary MPA boundaries were evaluated against some of these objectives using a static, map-based process, yet further assessment and additional objectives could be addressed with dynamic approaches. Here, the MPA's evaluation was expanded using the joint application of two published dynamic ecosystem models to further appraise the MPA. These models also considered potential impacts of climate change in the region, and greater insight can be gained from using them together rather than independently. Both models projected the proposed MPA could increase ecosystem viability in the region by reducing potential population declines, especially of penguins. These benefits manifested even when the impacts of climate change occurred over the long term, and likely accrued due to protection of areas important for krill aggregation and predator foraging. Model outcomes also suggested possible improvements to the preliminary MPA boundaries to reinforce these benefits. Using the two structurally distinct models together increased confidence in results and the potential for an MPA to meet multiple policy objectives in the region, and the paper further details the process of translating outcomes into timely decision support for stakeholders. Modelling results were regularly communicated using established formal and informal channels, ensuring modelderived advice directly supported policy needs. Collectively, the work demonstrates the process and value of leveraging existing ecosystem models, quickly adapting models to policy needs, and developing actionable advice for policy makers.																	0308-597X	1872-9460				NOV	2020	121								104109	10.1016/j.marpol.2020.104109							WOS:000595872300001

We determined the composition of euphausiid species in diet samples collected from Adelie (Pygoscelis adeliae), chinstrap (Pygoscelis antarcticus) and gentoo (Pygoscelis papua) penguins on King George Island (South Shetlands Islands) during a breeding season. For all three penguin species, euphausiids (mainlyE. superba) represented almost the entirety of researched stomach samples (i.e. 99.9% in the case of Adelie and chinstrap penguins), while gentoo penguins also proved to feed on fish (99.4% krill; 0.5% fish). Analysed material differed in the size of eatenE. superbaspecimens, with the smallest crustaceans consumed by Adelie penguins. Furthermore, we found differences in the ratio of consumed krill and krill size. Such disparities may be a result of sex-based differences and slight differences in feeding areas between the birds. Additionally, we noted some fragments of plastic debris in the investigated penguin diet samples.

Ready to spawn females, have high lipid content in ovaries, while in males and spent females, the major site of lipid deposits was the digestive gland, followed by the fat body. These differences among spawning and spent females are indicative of strong interactions between the ovary and digestive gland and the ovary and fat body during vitellogenesis. Triacylglycerols (TAG) were the major neutral lipid class with high levels in the digestive gland. The major phospholipid was phosphatidylcholine (PC) particularly in the muscular tissue of the abdomen. Phosphatidyl-ethanolamine (PE) and -serine-inositol (PS-PI), were present at intermediate levels. Reproductive males were depleted in TAG and diacylglycerols (DAG) in the digestive gland, gonad and fat body, and had 4 times lower cholesterol in the gonad than ready to spawn females. Furthermore, ready to spawn females had in the ovary higher amounts of TAG, DAG and phospholipids (PC, PE, PS-PI) than spent females. Linear relationships between lipid content and main lipid class (TAG, PC, PE, PS-PT) in different fractions of males and ready to spawn females showed that: (1). TAG was stored for both sexes in all cephalothorax fractions with highest values in the digestive gland and ovary fluid; (2). PC was accumulated for both sexes in the fat body and the gonad with a higher slope for females, with the highest values in the ovary fluid and in the abdomen of males and that (3). PS-PI was stored only in the ovary and abdomen of mature females. These results are discussed in terms of the strategy developed by Meganyctiphanes norvegica to allocate lipids to the next generation for optimised embryogenesis. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Inc.

Krill Nyctiphanes simplex gonad affection associated with acute-intensity phyllobothriid plerocercoid infection	PARASITOLOGY RESEARCH												This is the first acute-intensity record of helminths parasitizing the subtropical krill Nyctiphanes simplex Hansen, 1911. We briefly describe the pathology of infection of Phyllobothriidae gen. sp. plerocercoids parasitizing N. simplex in the Gulf of California. Infection occurred with a very low prevalence (P = 0.06%, n = 1563 specimens), although acute-intensity exceeded several hundred plerocercoids crowding the hemocoel in one female host. Nyctiphanes simplex showed inflammatory response of hemocyte-based infiltration, nodule formation, and presumptive melanization. Remarkably, cestodes invade and supplant the gonad, causing atretic oocytes and severe tissue destruction in the gonad likely leading to castration and cell death in connective tissue of the infected organs suggesting that acute-intensity infection exceeds the krill's reaction capacity. Thus, Phyllobothriidae gen. sp. negatively affects the host by depleting its fitness, leading to total castration to prevent/block host reproduction.

The aim of the study was to determine the effects of krill oil supplementation on post exercise immune function and performance. Methods Nineteen males and 18 females (age: 25.8 +/- 5.3 years; mean +/- S.D.) were randomly assigned to 2 g/day of krill oil (n = 18) or placebo (n = 19) supplementation for 6 weeks. A maximal incremental exercise test and cycling time trial (time to complete set amount of work) were performed pre-supplementation with the time trial repeated post-supplementation. Blood samples collected pre-and post-supplementation at rest, and immediately, 1 and 3h post-exercise. Plasma IL-6 and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) concentrations and, erythrocyte fatty acid composition were measured. Natural killer (NK) cell cytotoxic activity and peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) IL-2, IL-4, IL-10, IL-17 and IFN. production were also measured. Results No effects of gender were noted for any variable. PBMC IL-2 and NK cell cytotoxic activity were greater (P < 0.05) 3h post exercise in the krill oil compared to the control group. Plasma IL-6 and TBARS, PBMC IL-4, IL-10, IL-17 and IFN. production, along with performance and physiological measures during exercise, were not different between groups. Conclusion Six weeks of krill oil supplementation can increase PBMC IL-2 production and NK cell cytotoxic activity 3h post-exercise in both healthy young males and females. Krill oil does not modify exercise performance.

J	Tynan, CT				Tynan, CT			Ecological importance of the Southern Boundary of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current	NATURE												The Southern Ocean surrounds the Antarctic continent and supports one of the most productive marine ecosystems. Migratory and endemic species of whales, seals and birds benefit from the high biomass of their principal prey, krill (Euphausia superba) and cephalopods, in this area. Most species of baleen whales and male sperm whales in the Southern Hemisphere migrate between low-latitude breeding grounds in winter and highly productive Antarctic feeding grounds in summer. Here I show the importance of the southernmost reaches of the strongest ocean current, the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC), to a complex and predictable food web of the Southern Ocean, The circumpolar distributions of blue, fin and humpback whales from spring to midsummer trace the non-uniform high-latitude penetration of shoaled, nutrient-rich Upper Circumpolar Deep Water, which is carried eastward by the ACC, The poleward extent of this water mass delineates the Southern Boundary(1) of the ACC and corresponds not only to the circumpolar distributions of baleen whales, but also to distributions of krill and to regions of high, seasonally averaged, phytoplankton biomass, Sperm whales, which feed on cephalopods(2), also congregate in highest densities near the Southern Boundary. The association of primary production, Krill, and whales with the Southern Boundary, suggests that it provides predictably productive foraging for many species, and is of critical importance to the function of the Southern Ocean ecosystem.																	0028-0836					APR 16	1998	392	6677					708	710		10.1038/33675							WOS:000073129000056

We used a related species, Meganyctiphanes, North Atlantic krill, to visualize the flow field produced by tethered shrimps in an aquarium. In this situation, the propulsion jet flow some centimeters behind the shrimp is surrounded by a vortex ring of recoiling water motion from which, if the vortex is also produced by unrestrained swimming shrimp, a following shrimp hypothetically can draw forces of lift and propulsion to decrease energy expense in long-distance migration. Two antennular sensitivities to water vibration in frequency ranges 5-40 and 40-150 Hz were calibrated, and the activity of connected interneurons was traced into the abdominal pleopod-carrying segments. Water oscillation of 3-10 Hz frequency, applied to the antennules, was shown to entrain a closely synchronous pleopod beat in the stimulated specimens.

However, understanding their population dynamics is limited by a paucity of data due to sampling challenges. Antarctic fur seal Arctocephalus gazella scats provide large collections of otoliths and other prey remains that can be used to form time series for important mesopelagic taxa such as Gymnoscopelus nicholsi (Gn). Examination of otoliths from scats allowed for a reconstruction of Gn age and length structure from 8 selected sample years between 2000 and 2015. While mean reconstructed length did not change significantly over the time series, mean age declined. Older age classes were scarce in scat samples, and age-6 animals were not found after 2008. During the same time period, Gn otoliths in fur seal scats declined from approximately 2000 to fewer than 200. The decline in the number of otoliths in Antarctic fur seal scat samples coupled with the negative trend in mean age suggests declines in the availability of Gn on the South Shetland Island slope region between 2000 and 2015. This study demonstrates the utility of central-place foragers in assessing populations of unfished but ecologically important mesopelagic fishes, thus allowing evaluation of hypotheses about their population structure and dispersal.

J	Willis, J				Willis, Jay			Whales maintained a high abundance of krill; both are ecosystem engineers in the Southern Ocean	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												Krill abundance was predicted to rise after the end of commercial whaling in the Southern Ocean due to the release of predatory pressure from 2 million whales that were killed between 1915 and 1970, but contrary to expectations, there has been a substantial decline in abundance of krill since the end of whaling. I presented a model 7 yr ago which explained how krill behaviour, in response to the threat of predation by whales, may provide an answer to this paradox. The original model contained a speculative link: a mechanism by which krill could detect the presence of whales over a wide area, and therefore could behave in response to a credible threat. Recently, iron has been implicated in a positive feedback cycle between whales, krill and primary production. The cycle depends on the buoyant faeces of whales fertilising surface layers. This is both a plausible way for krill to detect whales over a wide area and an explanation for enhanced feeding at the surface, but this was not incorporated in the original model. Thus, nutrient retention and behavioural control are probably an example of niche construction and ecosystem engineering by both krill and whales. In this paper I revisit and update the simple model of krill mentioned above. The model is calibrated against known system states and is used to imply the ecosystem level changes caused by commercial whaling.

Modelling spatiotemporal trends in range shifts of marine commercial fish species driven by climate change surrounding the Antarctic Peninsula	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												In recent decades, the relationships between species distributional shifts and climate change have been investigated at various geographic scales, yet there is still a gap in understanding the impacts of climate change on marine commercial fish species surrounding the Antarctic Peninsula. The dynamic bioclimate envelope model (DBEM) is a mechanistic model that encompass species distribution model and population dynamic model approaches to project the spatiotemporal change of marine commercial fish species driven by various climate change scenarios in the Southern Ocean. This paper focuses on the spatiotemporal changes of marine commercial fish species surrounding the Antarctic Peninsula under a high emissions scenario (RCP8.5) and a low emissions scenario (REP2.6) from 1970 W 2060 following three different Earth System Models (ESMs), namely, the GFDL-ESM 2G, IPSL-CM5A-MR and MPI-ESM-MR. Results reveal that: i) The general latitudinal gradient patterns in species richness shifts poleward associated with a global abundance decrease ii) The Spp. richness in Eastern Antarctic Peninsula (EAP) is higher than in the Western Antarctic Peninsula (WAP) at the same latitude (>6.5 degrees S latitude). iii) The reasons are that the krill-dependent predators in WAP could face a higher risk of depletion than that in EAP clue to ocean warming and anthropogenic activities.

J	Jarman, SN				Jarman, SN			The evolutionary history of krill inferred from nuclear large subunit rDNA sequence analysis	BIOLOGICAL JOURNAL OF THE LINNEAN SOCIETY												Early events in the speciation history of krill (Malacostraca: Euphausiacea), an abundant group of extant pelagic crustaceans, were studied with slowly evolving nuclear DNA sequences (large subunit ribosomal DNA, 288 rDNA). Krill have no fossil record, so very little is known about their palaeobiology. The timing of past speciation events in krill was estimated by comparing change in their 288 rDNA to change in the 288 rDNA of their close relatives that do have a fossil record. Relationships between krill genera were also studied by phylogenetic analysis of partial 288 rDNA sequences. The analyses estimated the time that the last common ancestor of the krill family Euphausiidae lived to be the lower Cretaceous about 130 million years ago (Mya). Two lineages of krill survived the end Cretaceous extinctions 65 Mya and the modern genera of krill were established before the end of the Palaeogene 23 Mya.

J	Kasamatsu, F				Kasamatsu, F			Species diversity of the whale community in the Antarctic	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												The impact of commercial exploitation of whales on species diversity in the Antarctic whale community has not yet been documented. I report a correlation between the lowest species diversity and the largest biomass in the high productivity region near the ice-edge. Species diversity was higher and constant in waters beyond 60 n miles (similar to 111 km) away from the ice-edge. Density and biomass showed the opposite trend. Species diversity increased with time in a part of the study area where large whales were depleted, but numbers are now recovering. This suggests that the whale community is moving toward a new balance of species composition during its recovery from past whaling impacts.																	0171-8630						2000	200						297	301		10.3354/meps200297							WOS:000088651400026

Such SA/AKP fiber did not only have similar crystalline structure with human hair, but also had super flame resistance and mechanical performance. It should be noted that the whole preparation process was green without any incorporation of non-toxic solution. Moreover, comparing with human hair, the SA/AKP fiber had a lot of unique groove upon the fiber surface, which contributed a lot to excellent hygroscopicity. Meanwhile, the dyeing performance could be improved notably due to incorporation of protein into the matrix. Herein, the SA/AKP fiber with superior mechanical and functional performance had practical value for application in the field of synthetic wig. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Diet and trophic niche of Antarctic silverfish Pleuragramma antarcticum in the Ross Sea, Antarctica	JOURNAL OF FISH BIOLOGY												The diet of Antarctic silverfish Pleuragramma antarcticum was evaluated by examining stomach contents of specimens collected in the Ross Sea (71 degrees 77 degrees S; 165 degrees 180 degrees E) in January to March 2008. Pleuragramma antarcticum (50236 mm standard length, LS) and prey items were analysed for stable-isotopic composition of carbon and nitrogen. According to index of relative importance (IRI), which incorporates frequency of occurrence, mass and number of prey items, the most important prey items were copepods (81%IRI over all specimens), predominantly Metridia gerlachei and Paraeuchaeta sp., with krill and fishes having low IRI (2.2 and 5.6%IRI overall). According to mass of prey (M) in stomachs, however, fishes (P. antarcticum and myctophids) and krill dominated overall diet (48 and 22%M, respectively), with copepods being a relatively minor constituent of overall diet by mass (9.9%M). Piscivory by P. antarcticum occurred mainly in the extreme south-west of the region and near the continental slope. Krill identified to species level in P. antarcticum stomachs were predominantly Euphausia superba (14.1%M) with some Euphausia crystallophorias (4.8%M). Both DistLM modelling (PRIMER-permanova+) on stomach contents (by IRI) and stepwise generalized linear modelling on stable isotopes showed that LS and location were significant predictors of P. antarcticum diet. Postlarval P. antarcticum (5089 mm LS) consumed exclusively copepods. Juvenile P. antarcticum (90151 mm LS) consumed predominantly krill and copepods by mass (46 and 30%M, respectively). Small adult P. antarcticum (152178 mm LS) consumed krill, fishes and copepods (37, 36 and 15%M, respectively). Large adult P. antarcticum (179236 mm LS) consumed predominantly fishes and krill (55 and 17%M, respectively), especially in the north (near the Ross Sea slope) and in the SW Ross Sea. Amphipods were occasionally important prey items for P. antarcticum (western Ross Sea, 39%M). General concordance between stomach contents and trophic level of P. antarcticum and prey based on d15N was demonstrated. Pleuragramma antarcticum trophic level was estimated as 3.7 (postlarval fish) and 4.1 (fish aged 3+ years).

This paper examines in situ feeding cycles, ingestion rates and growth of larval krill Euphausia superba. Larval krill were exceptionally numerous, especially over the shelf break and continental slope: mean 8872 larvae m(-2), maximum 30 084 larvae m-2. The developmental stage composition of krill larvae over the shelf was advanced compared to that at continental slope stations, which may have resulted from enhanced food availability over the shelf. Despite the season being late autumn, the feeding activity of larval krill was similar to published summer rates. The intermoult period of larval krill ranged from 6 to 17 days, with daily growth rates reaching 2.2% of body length, 8.7% of body wet mass and 5.7% of body carbon. Daily ingestion rates were 8.5-17.6 mug C ind(-1) d(-1) for calyptopis 3 to furcilia 2 and 35.1-57.4 mug C ind(-1) d(-1) for furcilia 3-5, and were positively correlated with ambient chlorophyll a concentrations. Daily rations showed the same tendency, ranging from 21.5 to 44.5% of body Cd-1 (catyptopis 3 to furcilia 2) and from 17.8 to 29.2% of body Cd-1 (furcilia 3-5). Comparison of daily rations between open water and sea ice stations supports the notion that larval krill at low pelagic food supply under the sea ice have to exploit ice biota to sustain their metabolic demands.

A serine proteinase isolated from E. superba shows collagenolytic properties: it acts on collagens from Achilles tendon (type I and V) and reconstituted fibrils of calf skin collagen under conditions that do not denature the substrates. 2. At 25-degrees-C and pH 7.5 the enzyme both splits the calf skin collagen in solution to the fragments TC(A) and TC(B) and catalyses the conversion of dimeric molecules to monomeric chains. 3. The enzyme exhibits strong chymotrypsin-like and lower trypsin-like activities. 4. All the enzyme activities are inhibited to the same degree by diisopropylfluorophosphate (DFP), phenylmethylsulphonyl fluoride (PMSF), N-alpha-tosyl-L-lysine chloromethyl ketone (TLCK), soybean trypsin inhibitor (SBTI), chicken ovomucoid (CHOM), chymostatin and leupeptin. None of the activities is inhibited by chelating agents and L-cysteine. 5. pH-Optima of the proteinase in protein substrates hydrolysis (6.0-6.2) are lower than those of synthetic substrates cleavage (7.8-8.0 in the case of BzTyrOEt and 8.7-8.9 for BzArgOEt). 6. Four from nine cysteine residues present in the enzyme molecule possess free thiol-groups. Since the enzyme is inhibited by p-chloromercuribenzoate (pCMB), N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) and iodoacetic acid (IAA), the role of its thiol-groups has been discussed.

Submarine canyons represent an essential habitat network for krill hotspots in a Large Marine Ecosystem	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS												Submarine canyon systems are ubiquitous features of marine ecosystems, known to support high levels of biodiversity. Canyons may be important to benthic-pelagic ecosystem coupling, but their role in concentrating plankton and structuring pelagic communities is not well known. We hypothesize that at the scale of a large marine ecosystem, canyons provide a critical habitat network, which maintain energy flow and trophic interactions. We evaluate canyon characteristics relative to the distribution and abundance of krill, critically important prey in the California Current Ecosystem. Using a geological database, we conducted a census of canyon locations, evaluated their dimensions, and quantified functional relationships with krill hotspots (i.e., sites of persistently elevated abundance) derived from hydro-acoustic surveys. We found that 76% of krill hotspots occurred within and adjacent to canyons. Most krill hotspots were associated with large shelf-incising canyons. Krill hotspots and canyon dimensions displayed similar coherence as a function of latitude and indicate a potential regional habitat network. The latitudinal migration of many fish, seabirds and mammals may be enhanced by using this canyon-krill network to maintain foraging opportunities. Biogeographic assessments and predictions of krill and krill-predator distributions under climate change may be improved by accounting for canyons in habitat models.																	2045-2322					MAY 15	2018	8								7579	10.1038/s41598-018-25742-9							WOS:000432108700025	29765085

Data obtained from these drifters and from a select number of local historical drifters provide the most detailed observations to date of the surface circulation in the northwestern Weddell Sea. The Antarctic Slope Front (ASF), characterized by a similar to 20 cm s(-1) current following the 1000-m isobath, is the dominant feature east of the peninsula. The slope front bifurcates when it encounters the South Scotia Ridge with the drifters following one of three paths. Drifters (i) are carried westward into Bransfield Strait; (ii) follow the 1000-m isobath to the east along the southern edge of the South Scotia Ridge; or (iii) become entrained in a large-standing eddy over the South Scotia Ridge. Drifters are strongly steered by contours of f/h (Coriolis frequency/depth) as shown by calculations of the first two moments of displacement in both geographic coordinates and coordinates locally aligned with contours of f/h. An eddy-mean decomposition of the drifter velocities indicates that shear in the mean flow makes the dominant contribution to dispersion in the along-f/h direction, but eddy processes are more important in dispersing particles across contours of f/h. The results of the ADELIE study suggest that the circulation near the tip of the Antarctic Peninsula may influence ecosystem dynamics in the Southern Ocean through Antarctic krill transport and the export of nutrients.

The nipper trophic levels of this open-ocean epipelagic community are exceptional in that they contain no fish species. Fishes are replaced by cephalopods, including the ommastrephid squid, Martialia hyadesi. This squid preys on mesopelagic myctophids (lanternfish), which feed largely on copepods. We identify here a geographically distinct, Antarctic, open-ocean food chain which is of importance to air breathing predator species but where Antarctic krill, Euphausia superba, is absent. This system is probably prevalent in al eas of higher primary productivity, especially the Scotia Sea and near the peri-Antarctic islands, Squid stocks in the APFZ may have potential for commercial exploitation, but they, and the predators they support, are likely to be sensitive to overfishing. Squid have a short, semelparous lifecycle, so overfishing in a single year can cause a stock to collapse.

J	Kooyman, GL				Kooyman, GL			Evolutionary and ecological aspects of some Antarctic and sub-Antarctic penguin distributions	OECOLOGIA												Penguins probably originated in the core of Gondwanaland when South America, Africa, and Antarctica were just beginning to separate. As the continents drifted apart, the division filled with what became the southern ocean. One of the remaining land masses moved south and was caught at the pole by the Earth's rotation. It became incrusted with ice and is now known as East Antarctica. Linking it to South America was a series of submerged mountain ranges that formed a necklace of islands. The northern portion of the necklace, called the Scotia Are, is now the "fertile crescent" of the Southern Ocean. The greatest numbers and biomass of penguins are found here as well as that of krill, the primary prey species of most penguins, and many other marine predators, Today penguins are found throughout the sub-Antarctic islands and around the entire Antarctic continent. Using satellite transmitters and time-depth recorders, while taking advantage of the parental dedication of breeding birds, numerous investigators have described foraging habits of several species of penguins. The information obtained is labor intensive and costly so that studies are restricted to certain species, areas and seasons. Here I review the patterns evident among six of the most abundant and completely Studied of the penguins. The variation in behavior is considerable from those species that seldom dive deeper than 20 m in search of prey to those that will dive to depths >500 m to catch mesopelagic fish and squid. Foraging trips from breeding colonies vary among species and with the season. Often the birds travel no more than 30 km and at other times the trips may exceed 600 km. Sub-Antarctic species often reach more productive waters near or within the Antarctic Polar Front zone, where the mixing of Antarctic and sub-Antarctic waters provide rich resources for their prey. Antarctic species usually remain close to shore, along the continental slope, or near the sea ice edge. Less is known about penguins during the pelagic phase between breeding cycles. What we do know is surprising in regard to their dispersal, which ranges from hundreds to thousands of kilometers from the breeding colonies.					, gerald/0000-0002-8872-2950												0029-8549					FEB	2002	130	4					485	495		10.1007/s00442-001-0836-x							WOS:000174695700001	28547249

Climate variability and spatiotemporal dynamics of five Southern Ocean krill species	PROGRESS IN OCEANOGRAPHY												Understanding the ecological response of marine organisms to future climate change will benefit from quantifying spatiotemporal aspects of their distribution and abundance as well as the influence of ocean-atmospheric climate modes on their population cycles. Our study provides a synthesis of 18 years of data (1992-2009) for 5 krill (euphausiid) species monitored near the North Antarctic Peninsula (NAP) during austral summer. Distribution and abundance data are presented for postlarval stages of Euphausia crystallorophias, E. frigida, E. superba, E. triacantha and Thysanoessa macrura and larval E. superba and T. macrura. Intraseasonal, interannual and longer-term distribution and abundance patterns are quantified relative to climate modes driving ecosystem variability off the Antarctic Peninsula: El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), Southern Annual Mode (SAM) and associated zonal and meridional winds. Interannual abundance variations of all 5 species are significantly correlated with seasonally averaged ENSO indices and, with the exception of E. triacantha, elevated population sizes are associated with the higher productivity La Nina phase. Time-lagged responses of each species to ENSO indices approximate their generation times and suggest evolution of their life histories and reproductive efforts in accordance with the ENSO cycle. Postlarval E. aystallorophias and E. frigida and larval T. macrura demonstrate significant abundance increases after 1998 associated with a shift from an El Nino dominated period to predominantly La Nina and "Nino-neutral" conditions. Seasonal changes in species distributions and co-occurrence indicate portions of the southernmost E. frigida, E. triacantha and T. macrura populations move poleward with E. superba during late-summer, suggesting that environmental conditions associated with sea ice development (e.g., food, retention) may be more favorable than within the Antarctic Circumpolar Current during low productivity seasons. Spatial distributions of larval and postlarval T. macrura suggest 2 separate spawning populations within oceanic and coastal waters. Lastly, mean euphausiid species concentrations and abundance relationships encountered during 1992-2009 are remarkably similar to those reported for the Antarctic Peninsula during the 1928-1935 Discovery Investigations. Circumpolar observations of E. superba "superswarms" associated with a major climatically related ecosystem change in the late 1970s may have represented an episodic period of anomalous peak abundance. Subsequent abundance estimates compared to these anomalies would indicate a significant decrease, but should not be taken to reflect the impact of climate warming. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Dynamic foraging of a top predator in a seasonal polar marine environment	OECOLOGIA												They seasonal movement of animals at broad spatial scales provides insight into life-history, ecology and conservation. By combining high-resolution satellite-tagged data with hierarchical Bayesian movement models, we can associate spatial patterns of movement with marine animal behavior. We used a multi-state mixture model to describe humpback whale traveling and area-restricted search states as they forage along the West Antarctic Peninsula. We estimated the change in the geography, composition and characteristics of these behavioral states through time. We show that whales later in the austral fall spent more time in movements associated with foraging, traveled at lower speeds between foraging areas, and shifted their distribution northward and inshore. Seasonal changes in movement are likely due to a combination of sea ice advance and regional shifts in the primary prey source. Our study is a step towards dynamic movement models in the marine environment at broad scales.

Focusing on Antarctic suspension feeders, we surveyed the variation of carbon (delta C-13) and nitrogen (delta N-15) stable isotopes in three different stations with contrasting characteristics in terms of glacier-sedimentary regimes and distance from the glacier. Bayesian mixing models were used to estimate the relative contribution of eight potential food sources at the study sites and to the consumers' diet. The isotopically signatures of suspension feeders displayed a broad range of assimilate available food sources with distinct contributions at each site. Overall, for most of the suspension feeders analysed, contributions of suspended particulate matter and macroalgae detritus tended to prevail over the rest of the potential food sources. Additionally, we confirm the assimilation of krill faeces by benthic organisms reinforcing its relevance as food source in nearshore Antarctic ecosystems. Mixing models corroborated the influence of glacier discharge on the spatial distribution of available food sources, since their contribution in the suspension feeders diet was different and more heterogeneous in the internal stations (ice-proximal zone) than in the external one (ice-distal zone). The analysis of isotopic signatures of primary benthic consumers (suspension feeders) indicated the spatial heterogeneity of food sources and its composition in coastal Antarctic nearshore, as consequence of the glacial influence on the local environment and hydrology.

A Phospholipid-Protein Complex from Antarctic Krill Reduced Plasma Homocysteine Levels and Increased Plasma Trimethylamine-N-Oxide (TMAO) and Carnitine Levels in Male Wistar Rats	MARINE DRUGS												Seafood is assumed to be beneficial for cardiovascular health, mainly based on plasma lipid lowering and anti-inflammatory effects of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids. However, other plasma risk factors linked to cardiovascular disease are less studied. This study aimed to penetrate the effect of a phospholipid-protein complex (PPC) from Antarctic krill on one-carbon metabolism and production of trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO) in rats. Male Wistar rats were fed isoenergetic control, 6%, or 11% PPC diets for four weeks. Rats fed PPC had reduced total homocysteine plasma level and increased levels of choline, dimethylglycine and cysteine, whereas the plasma level of methionine was unchanged compared to control. PPC feeding increased the plasma level of TMAO, carnitine, its precursors trimethyllysine and -butyrobetaine. There was a close correlation between plasma TMAO and carnitine, trimethyllysine, and -butyrobetaine, but not between TMAO and choline. The present data suggest that PPC has a homocysteine lowering effect and is associated with altered plasma concentrations of metabolites related to one-carbon metabolism and B-vitamin status in rats. Moreover, the present study reveals a non-obligatory role of gut microbiota in the increased plasma TMAO level as it can be explained by the PPC's content of TMAO. The increased level of carnitine and carnitine precursors is interpreted to reflect increased carnitine biosynthesis.

Spatio-temporal persistence of top predator hotspots near the Antarctic Peninsula	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												We quantified species richness and abundance of seabirds and marine mammals in order to identify marine areas that are persistently attractive to top predators. Shipboard surveys across a 150 000 km(2) grid off the Antarctic Peninsula were conducted once or twice each year from 2003 to 2011 during which the distribution and abundance of top predators were mapped. We hypothesized that spatial organization of species richness and abundance hotspots reflect persistent habitat use and are regionalized according to distance from land and oceanographic boundaries. To test this, we used a new hotspot variance metric based on the percentage of time that the species richness or abundance estimate at any one location is greater than 1 standard deviation above the long term means for the entire survey grid. Species richness hotspots were based on all species sighted, while abundance hotspots were based on concentrations of 16 species: 13 seabirds (penguins, petrels and albatrosses), 1 pinniped and 2 baleen whales. Species abundance hotspots reflected 2 major groupings-those with oceanic and coastal origins. We identified 15 richness hotspots, 9 of which were in proximity to the southern Antarctic Circumpolar Current front; the 6 others were associated with major breeding colonies and the location of 2 submarine canyon systems. Our approach integrates temporal and spatial variances over 14 individual surveys and provides useful reference points for identifying ecologically important areas, refining food web models and developing spatial management of and conservation strategies for marine ecosystems.																	0171-8630	1616-1599					2013	487						287	304		10.3354/meps10350							WOS:000322577400023

Phytoplankton odor modifies the response of Euphausia superba to flow	POLAR BIOLOGY												Antarctic krill, Euphausia superba, are critical components of the Antarctic food web as well as important targets for conservation and management. Krill behavior has important effects on demographic properties and aggregation characteristics, but remains incompletely known. Krill clearly respond to different environmental stimuli such as light, flow and chemicals, but few studies have quantified these behaviors. We examined the behavior of krill in well-quantified current speeds in a laboratory flume and examined interactions of phytoplankton odor and flow. Krill are sensitive to flow speeds as low as 1 mm s(-1), and flow polarizes krill swimming and orientation in the up-current direction. Phytoplankton odor increases the sensitivity of krill to flow, and induces area-restricted search behaviors that presumably allow krill to exploit food patches efficiently. The ability to quantify krill behavior could have important consequences for understanding demographic processes and the properties of krill aggregations.																	0722-4060	1432-2056				MAR	2019	42	3					509	516		10.1007/s00300-018-02440-w							WOS:000459821700007						
J	Mikami, H; Mukai, T; Iida, K				Mikami, H; Mukai, T; Iida, K			Measurements of density and sound speed contrasts for estimating krill target strength using theoretical scattering models	NIPPON SUISAN GAKKAISHI												In recent years, acoustic technology has been extensively used for estimating krill abundance. This acoustic assessment is required for precise estimate of target strength (TS) of a krill. However, prediction of the target strength from the theoretical scattering models is generally dependent on the swimming angle, the density and sound speed contrasts between krill and seawater. In these parameters, the density contrasts and sound speed contrasts are known to change during the year. In this study, the seasonal variations of the specific density and sound speed contrasts of Euphausia pacifica are presented. The specific densities of E. pacifica were measured in a series of saline or glycerol solutions of different densities. The measurements of the sound speed were performed using T-shaped velocimeter with two transducers mounted at the ends of the horizontal tube. The specific densities of E. pacifica changed about 1% with season. The sound speed contrasts also varied about 3% with season. These seasonal changes yielded difference about 5 dB in target strength of E. pacifica calculated from a straight cylinder model.

There is increasing evidence that the occurrence and development of OA are modulated by the dietary intake of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA). This study investigated the effects of dietary PUFA, including n-3/n-6 PUFA proportion and the molecular form of n-3 PUFA, on OA using osteoporotic osteoarthritis dual model mice, where phospholipid type n-3 PUFA were specifically examined. The results revealed that a low proportion of n-6/n-3 PUFA in diets from 1 : 1 to 6 : 1 significantly improved the cartilage structure and inhibited articular cartilage polysaccharide loss. Furthermore, the low proportion n-6/n-3 PUFA diets inhibited the NF-kappa B signaling pathway by activating G-protein coupled receptor 120 (GPR120) to reduce inflammation and inhibit catabolism. Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) oil (AKO), rich in phospholipid-type n-3 PUFA, had a better effect on OA than linseed oil (plant-derived n-3 PUFA), which may be due to peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPAR gamma). These findings suggested that the low proportion n-6/n-3 PUFA diets, particularly with AKO, alleviated inflammation and inhibited articular cartilage degeneration. Therefore, dietary intervention can be a potential treatment for OA.

The Response of Antarctic Sea Ice Algae to Changes in pH and CO2	PLOS ONE												Ocean acidification substantially alters ocean carbon chemistry and hence pH but the effects on sea ice formation and the CO2 concentration in the enclosed brine channels are unknown. Microbial communities inhabiting sea ice ecosystems currently contribute 10-50% of the annual primary production of polar seas, supporting overwintering zooplankton species, especially Antarctic krill, and seeding spring phytoplankton blooms. Ocean acidification is occurring in all surface waters but the strongest effects will be experienced in polar ecosystems with significant effects on all trophic levels. Brine algae collected from McMurdo Sound (Antarctica) sea ice was incubated in situ under various carbonate chemistry conditions. The carbon chemistry was manipulated with acid, bicarbonate and bases to produce a pCO(2) and pH range from 238 to 6066 mu atm and 7.19 to 8.66, respectively. Elevated pCO(2) positively affected the growth rate of the brine algal community, dominated by the unique ice dinoflagellate, Polarella glacialis. Growth rates were significantly reduced when pH dropped below 7.6. However, when the pH was held constant and the pCO(2) increased, growth rates of the brine algae increased by more than 20% and showed no decline at pCO(2) values more than five times current ambient levels. We suggest that projected increases in seawater pCO(2), associated with OA, will not adversely impact brine algal communities.

Variability in tissue-specific trophic discrimination factors ( increment C-13 and increment N-15) between Antarctic krill Euphausia superba and free-ranging Pygoscelis penguins	POLAR BIOLOGY												For top consumers in marine environments, trophic discrimination factors ( increment C-13 and increment N-15) between food and consumers' tissues are expected to be similar among related species. However, few studies conducted in the laboratory indicate a large variability among species, which should be potentially higher in free-ranging animals. Here, we test for differences in tissue-specific increment C-13 and increment N-15 values of two wild penguin species (Chinstrap Pygoscelis antarctica and Gentoo P. papua) breeding in sympatry at Livingston Island, Antarctica. A total of 41 adults and 28 chicks, and food items comprised exclusively by Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba, n = 22) in Chinstraps and almost exclusively in Gentoos, were sampled for stable isotope analyses. Overall, Delta C-13 values varied between -1.8 and 4.0 parts per thousand and Delta N-15 values ranged from 1.2 to 6.1 parts per thousand, and these differed between species, tissues and age-classes. Delta C-13 in adult penguins differed between species for feather and blood. Species-specific differences in Delta C-13 and Delta N-15 were seen in chick nail and muscle, while only Delta C-13 values differed between species in feathers. Our results show that trophic discrimination factors can differ substantially between closely related species consuming similar prey, especially in Delta C-13 value. Variation in Delta C-13 was driven by species, tissue and age-class, while variation in Delta N-15 was mostly driven by tissue type. Trophic discrimination factors may be associated to physiological and/or stress factors which may fluctuate in the wild, and this was particularly evident on chicks. This study highlights the use of diet-specialised species for the determination of trophic discrimination factors in the wild.

COMMERCIAL FISHING VESSEL AS RESEARCH VESSELS IN THE ANTARCTIC - REQUIREMENTS AND SOLUTIONS EXEMPLIFIED WITH A NEW VESSEL	CCAMLR SCIENCE												The climate-induced changes presently seen in the ecosystems of the Antarctic region require a precautionary approach with respect to the human use of these ecosystems. In particular, resource harvesting requires enough basic knowledge, as well as adequate monitoring, to avoid unintended impacts on the harvested stocks and the associated ecosystem. Due to the vastness and remoteness of the Antarctic region, research vessel capacity is not readily available for conventional coverage of harvested stocks and their ecosystems. This paper describes the potential of using commercial fishing vessels to bridge the gap in research vessel capacity. The various tasks and required instrumentation are presented and discussed. To illustrate this concept a description of a Norwegian krill fishing vessel now under construction is presented. This type of combined fishing and research vessel could make a large amount of important data available for both management, through CCAMLR, and the broader scientific community and thus improve the basis for resource evaluation and management.

This study analyses samples obtained from Prydz Bay using a fine mesh (300 mu m) Rectangular Midwater Trawl (RMT1) net during summer 1992-93. Results demonstrate that a net of mesh 4.5 mm used in previous studies underestimates total copepod abundance by a factor of 38. The abundance of the smaller species has been underestimated the most. New estimates of copepod biomass indicate that copepods represent approximately 27% of krill biomass. Copepod and krill distributions are shown to be discrete at 82.4% dissimilarity. Mean temperature accounted for 33.6% of the variation in copepod distribution while two of the species showed a slight correlation with chlorophyll a pigment data. These results highlight the numerical importance of copepods and the species' distributions in the East Antarctic marine ecosystem.																	0954-1020					JUN	1997	9	2					121	133		10.1017/S0954102097000163							WOS:A1997XE79100002						
J	Bargu, S; Silver, MW				Bargu, S; Silver, MW			Field evidence of krill grazing on the toxic diatom genus Pseudo-nitzschia in Monterey Bay, California	BULLETIN OF MARINE SCIENCE												Both the interactions between toxic phytoplankton and their grazers, and the transport of these toxins through the food chain are relatively poorly understood. Recently, species of the diatom Pseudo-nitzschia have been found to produce the neurotoxin domoic acid, which has caused detrimental effects to higher trophic levels in the food web. One of the key potential vectors for the toxin is the euphausiids (krill). To determine whether krill feed in nature on local species of Pseudo-nitzschia, we compared diatoms in the water to those in the gut of three species of euphausiids in July 1998 during a P pseudodelicatissima bloom and in the gut of one species of euphausiid in August 2000 during a R australis bloom in Monterey Bay, California. Our findings show that Pseudo-nitzschia was the most abundant diatom in water samples at both times and was also the dominant food in krill. Our findings show that Pseudo-nitzschia was the most abundant diatom in water samples at both times and was also the dominant food in krill, though these diatoms were more common in the diet of resident than in transient species of krill. Thus we demonstrate that krill may be a critical vector in the transmission of domoic acid to organisms at higher trophic levels, including squid, seabirds, and whales, since these predators normally consume krill in Monterey Bay.																	0007-4977	1553-6955				MAY	2003	72	3					629	638									WOS:000187026500003

Effects of Whaling on the Structure of the Southern Ocean Food Web: Insights on the "Krill Surplus'' from Ecosystem Modelling	PLOS ONE												The aim of this study was to examine the ecological plausibility of the "krill surplus'' hypothesis and the effects of whaling on the Southern Ocean food web using mass-balance ecosystem modelling. The depletion trajectory and unexploited biomass of each rorqual population in the Antarctic was reconstructed using yearly catch records and a set of species-specific surplus production models. The resulting estimates of the unexploited biomass of Antarctic rorquals were used to construct an Ecopath model of the Southern Ocean food web existing in 1900. The rorqual depletion trajectory was then used in an Ecosim scenario to drive rorqual biomasses and examine the "krill surplus'' phenomenon and whaling effects on the food web in the years 1900-2008. An additional suite of Ecosim scenarios reflecting several hypothetical trends in Southern Ocean primary productivity were employed to examine the effect of bottom-up forcing on the documented krill biomass trend. The output of the Ecosim scenarios indicated that while the "krill surplus'' hypothesis is a plausible explanation of the biomass trends observed in some penguin and pinniped species in the mid-20th century, the excess krill biomass was most likely eliminated by a rapid decline in primary productivity in the years 1975-1995. Our findings suggest that changes in physical conditions in the Southern Ocean during this time period could have eliminated the ecological effects of rorqual depletion, although the mechanism responsible is currently unknown. Furthermore, a decline in iron bioavailability due to rorqual depletion may have contributed to the rapid decline in overall Southern Ocean productivity during the last quarter of the 20th century. The results of this study underscore the need for further research on historical changes in the roles of top-down and bottom-up forcing in structuring the Southern Ocean food web.

RF impacts on magnetic compasses have recently been demonstrated in migratory birds and other vertebrates. We set out to investigate the effect of RF on the magnetic orientation of the Antarctic krill species Gondogeneia antarctica, a small marine crustacean widespread along the Antarctic littoral line. Here, we show that upon release, G. antarctica (held under laboratory conditions) escaped in the magnetically seaward direction along the magnetic sea-land axis (y-axis) of the home beach. However, the animals were disoriented after being exposed to RF. Orientation was lost not only in an RF field with a magnetic flux density of 20 nT, as expected according to the literature, but even under the 2 nT originally intended as a control. Our results extend recent findings of the extraordinary sensitivity of animal magnetoreception to weak RF fields in marine invertebrates.																	0022-0949	1477-9145				JUN	2016	219	11					1717	1724		10.1242/jeb.132878							WOS:000376878000022	27026715

Mice were fed a low-fat control diet or a 3% (w/w) krill powder low-fat diet for 3 months. Gene expression profiling on liver samples revealed that the krill powder supplemented diet modulated a large number of pathways compared to the control diet. Metabolic pathways that were down-regulated included beta-oxidation, glucose metabolism, and amino acid catabolism. In contrast, the mitochondrial electron transport chain pathway was upregulated. Krill powder affected more pathways involved in protein metabolism than krill oil. Thus, a krill powder supplemented diet had potent and specific effects on energy metabolism and oxidative phosphorylation at the gene level. This indicates that krill powder supplementation could be an approach to prevent decline in mitochondrial respiratory chain function. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The mooring was situated at 150-m depth in the Oslofjord, connected with an onshore cable for power and transmission of digitized data. Records spanned 5 months from late autumn to spring. A current meter and CTD was associated with the acoustic mooring and a shore-based webcam monitored ice conditions in the fjord. The continuous measurements were supplemented with intermittent krill sampling campaigns and their physical and biological environment. The krill carried out diel vertical migration (DVM) throughout the winter, regardless of the distribution of potential prey. The fjord froze over in mid-winter and the daytime distribution of a mid-water SL of krill immediately became shallower associated with snow fall after freezing, likely related to reduction of light intensities. Still, a fraction of the population always descended all the way to the bottom, so that the krill population by day seemed to inhabit waters with light levels spanning up to six orders of magnitude. Deep-living krill ascended in synchrony with the rest of the population in the afternoon, but individuals consistently reappeared in near-bottom waters already <1 h after the ascent. Thereafter, the krill appeared to undertake asynchronous migrations, with some krill always being present in near-bottom waters even though the entire population appeared to undertake DVM.

J	Demer, DA				Demer, DA			An estimate of error for the CCAMLR 2000 survey estimate of krill biomass	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY												Combined sampling and measurement error is estimated for the CCAMLR 2000 acoustic estimate of krill abundance in the Scotia Sea. First, some potential sources of uncertainty in generic echo-integration surveys are reviewed. Then, specific to the CCAMLR 2000 survey, some of the primary sources of measurement error is explored. The error in system calibration is evaluated in relation to the effects of variations in water temperature and salinity on sound speed, sound absorption, and acoustic-beam characteristics. Variation in krill target strength is estimated using a distorted-wave Born approximation model fitted with measured distributions of animal lengths and orientations. The variable effectiveness of two-frequency species classification methods is also investigated using the same scattering model. Most of these components of measurement uncertainty are frequency-dependent and covariant. Ultimately, the total random error in the CCAMLR 2000 acoustic estimate of krill abundance is estimated from a Monte Carlo simulation which assumes independent estimates of krill biomass are derived from acoustic backscatter measurements at three frequencies (38, 120, and 200 kHz). The overall coefficient of variation (10.2less than or equal toCVless than or equal to11.6%; 95% CI) is not significantly different from the sampling variance alone (CV = 11.4%). That is, the measurement variance is negligible relative to the sampling variance due to the large number of measurements averaged to derive the ultimate biomass estimate. Some potential sources of bias (e.g., stemming from uncertainties in the target strength model, the krill length-to-weight model, the species classification method, bubble attenuation, signal thresholding, and survey area definition) may be more appreciable components of measurement uncertainty.

Here we provide a new analysis of body condition measurements, with particularly careful attention to the statistical model building and to model selection issues. We analyse body condition data for a large number (4704) of minke whales caught between 1987 and 2005. The data consist of five different variables related to body condition (fat weight, blubber thickness and girth) and a number of temporal, spatial and biological covariates. The body condition variables are analysed using linear mixed-effects models, for which we provide sound biological motivation. Further, we conduct model selection with the focused information criterion (FIC), reflecting the fact that we have a clearly specified research question, which leads us to a clear focus parameter of particular interest. We find that there has been a substantial decline in body condition over the study period (the net declines are estimated to 10% for fat weight, 7% for blubber thickness and 3% for the girth). Interestingly, there seems to be some differences in body condition trends between males and females and in different regions of the Antarctic. The decline in body condition could indicate major changes in the Antarctic ecosystem, in particular, increased competition from some larger krill-eating whale species.

Here, we present a new method for examining such interactions using the results from an acoustic survey of krill availability to foraging penguins. Analyses of fine-scale krill distributions within a 1852 x 1852 x 50 m volume of ocean revealed substantial prey patchiness in all dimensions. Our survey detected the presence of at least 6 krill aggregations in the survey area. The surface distribution of penguins was associated with the edges of these aggregations and was nonrandomly associated with krill densities above 0.1 krill m(-3) in the 30 to 40 m depth layer. The latter association was masked when krill abundance was integrated over the entire water column. Given that mean daytime dive depths for chinstrap penguins fall between 30 and 40 m, our data suggest penguins may fail to detect or choose to pass by shallow, denser prey aggregations and successfully forage on deeper, more homogeneously distributed krill offering higher encounter probabilities per unit volume searched. These findings reveal biologically important features of prey patchiness that cannot be addressed within the limitations of a primarily 2-dimensional analysis of predator-prey distributions. We emphasize that if we hope to gain a predictive understanding of the foraging behavior of diving predators, then we must consider fine-scale, 3-dimensional patterns of prey patchiness when assessing the availability of prey to diving predators.																	0171-8630					FEB	1996	131	1-3					1	10		10.3354/meps131001							WOS:A1996TZ66300001

Ice-associated (sympagic) microalgae could serve as a high-quality carbon source during winter, but their significance in the food web is so far unquantified. To better understand the importance of ice algae-produced carbon for the overwintering of Antarctic organisms, we investigated fatty acid (FA) and stable isotope compositions of 10 zooplankton species, and their potential sympagic and pelagic carbon sources. FA-specific carbon stable isotope compositions were used in stable isotope mixing models to quantify the contribution of ice algae-produced carbon ((Ice)) to the body carbon of each species. Mean (Ice) estimates ranged from 4% to 67%, with large variations between species and depending on the FA used for the modelling. Integrating the (Ice) estimates from all models, the sympagic amphipod Eusirus laticarpus was the most dependent on ice algal carbon ((Ice): 54%-67%), and the salp Salpa thompsoni showed the least dependency on ice algal carbon ((Ice): 8%-40%). Differences in (Ice) estimates between FAs associated with short-term vs. long-term lipid pools suggested an increasing importance of ice algal carbon for many species as the winter season progressed. In the abundant winter-active copepod Calanus propinquus, mean (Ice) reached more than 50% in late winter. The trophic carbon flux from ice algae into this copepod was between 3 and 5mgCm(-2)day(-1). This indicates that copepods and other ice-dependent zooplankton species transfer significant amounts of carbon from ice algae into the pelagic system, where it fuels the food web, the biological carbon pump and elemental cycling. Understanding the role of ice algae-produced carbon in these processes will be the key to predictions of the impact of future sea ice decline on Antarctic ecosystem functioning.

Lipid and fatty acid digestibility in Calanus copepod and krill oil by Atlantic halibut (Hippoglossus hippoglossus L.)	AQUACULTURE												Marine zooplankton represent a significant biomass of marine lipid that could supply lipid in diets for farmed marine fish. Digestibility of lipid and fatty acids of the copepod, Calanus finmarchicus and Antarctic krill, Euphausia superba by farmed juvenile Atlantic halibut (Hippoglossus hippoglossus) was investigated. Halibut were fed diets containing one of the following test oils at 15% inclusion level: fish oil (FO), Calanus copepod oil (CO) and Euphausia krill oil (1(0). KO contained the highest level of saturates (SFA: 39%) and monounsaturates (MUFA; 38%), and was low in polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA; 24%) compared to CO (50%) and FO (43%). CO and FO contained lower levels of SFA (31% and 33%, respectively) and MUFA (19% and 24%, respectively). Lipid digestibility of the CO diet (81%) was significantly lower than that of KO (90%) and FO (93%) diets (P < 0.05), likely due to wax esters in CO. Digestibility of SFA in the CO diet (70%) was significantly lower than FO (75%) and KO (77%) and MUFA in CO (84%) was significantly lower than KO (93%) and FO (93%). Digestibility of PUFA was significantly higher in FO (97%) than CO (94%) and KO (95%). Generally the CO diet was significantly less digestible than FO and KO diets.

Regression analyses clearly showed that blubber thickness, girth and fat weight have been decreasing for nearly 2 decades. The decrease per year is estimated at approximately 0.02 cm for mid-lateral blubber thickness and 17 kg for fat weight, corresponding to 9% for both measurements over the 18-year period. Furthermore, "date", "extent of diatom adhesion", "sex", "body length", "fetus length", "latitude", "age" and "longitude" were all identified as partially independent predictors of blubber thickness. The direct interpretation of this substantial decline in energy storage in terms of food availability is difficult, since no long-term krill abundance series is available. However, an increase in the abundance of krill feeders other than minke whales and a resulting decrease in the krill population must be considered as a likely explanation.				walloe, lars/P-6947-2018	Konishi, Kenji/0000-0002-6120-9903												0722-4060	1432-2056				NOV	2008	31	12					1509	1520		10.1007/s00300-008-0491-3							WOS:000260017200009

Five hauls were conducted north of the two islands at depths of 149 to 282 m on 21 February 2002. Published and unpublished reports from fishing operations in the 1970s and 1980s by the Fischkombinat in Rostock (former GDR), Sea Fisheries Institute in Gdynia (Poland) and material available from YugNIRO, Kerch (Ukraine) of what is known of fishing activities in the area were analysed. These data were previously unavailable to CCAMLR. Fishing and the extent of fishing was primarily dependant on whether and to what extent the target species of the fishery, the spiny icefish (Chaenodraco wilsoni), formed concentrations. Information on these fishing operations was, however, sparse, being restricted to the two seasons (1978/79 and 1979/80) when Polish and GDR vessels fished in the area. Length compositions from several fishing nations revealed that the fishery targeted primarily fish 25-35 cm long. The fish fauna at the tip of the Antarctic Peninsula represents a combination of low- and high-Antarctic elements. The available information on the biology of C. wilsoni was reviewed. Some new information was available on the reproduction and feeding of some of the species. Krill (Euphausia superba) formed a major element in the diet of icefish.																	1023-4063						2004	11						1	20									WOS:000225324900001

Histophagous ciliate Pseudocollinia brintoni and bacterial assemblage interaction with krill Nyctiphanes simplex. I. Transmission process	DISEASES OF AQUATIC ORGANISMS												Histophagous ciliates of the genus Pseudocollinia cause epizootic events that kill adult female krill (Euphausiacea), but their mode of transmission is unknown. We compared 16S rRNA sequences of bacterial strains isolated from stomachs of healthy krill Nyctiphanes simplex specimens with sequences of bacterial isolates and sequences of natural bacterial communities from the hemocoel of N. simplex specimens infected with P. brintoni to determine possible transmission pathways. All P. brintoni endoparasitic life stages and the transmission tomite stage (outside the host) were associated with bacterial assemblages. 16S rRNA sequences from isolated bacterial strains showed that Photobacterium spp. and Pseudoalteromonas spp. were dominant members of the bacterial assemblages during all life phases of P. brintoni and potential patho-bionts. They were apparently unaffected by the krill's immune system or the histophagous activity of P. brintoni. However, other bacterial strains were found only in certain P. brintoni life phases, indicating that as the infection progressed, microhabitat conditions and microbial interactions may have become unfavorable for some strains of bacteria. Trophic infection is the most parsimonious explanation for how P. brintoni infects krill. We estimated N. simplex vulnerability to P. brintoni infection during more than three-fourths of their life span, infecting mostly adult females. The ciliates have relatively high prevalence levels (albeit at <10% of sampled stations) and a short life cycle (estimated <7 d). Histophagous ciliate-krill interactions may occur in other krill species, particularly those that form dense swarms and attain high population densities that potentially enhance trophic transmission and allow completion of the Pseudocollinia spp. life cycle.				, Nelly/K-2552-2014; Del Angel-Rodriguez, Jorge A./AAI-9707-2021; Lopez-Cortes, Alejandro/AAF-7147-2020	, Nelly/0000-0002-8221-4680; Del Angel-Rodriguez, Jorge A./0000-0002-9960-1337; Lopez-Cortes, Alejandro/0000-0002-7567-3133; Zenteno-Savin, Tania/0000-0002-4080-9467												0177-5103	1616-1580				OCT 27	2015	116	3					213	225		10.3354/dao02922							WOS:000364088700007	26503776

Salp biomass ranged between 0 and 556 mgC.m-3 and was greatest at a station in the Bransfield Strait in late December 1990. Scalp biomass was lower than that of E. superba. Two species of salps; Salpa thompsoni and Ihlea racovitzai were found, and the former was dominant numerically. Spatial distribution and generation composition of these two species was different. Spatial distributions of salps and E. superba did not overlap particularly so the January-February period. While E. superba was found mainly in the coastal area which showed high-chlorophyll a values, salps exhibited high biomass in the oceanic area with low chlorophyll a concentrations. Predation by salps on small krill and the competitive removal of food by them, are discussed as potential reasons for the relatively low abundance of E. superba at the stations where salps were present in great numbers.

This study investigates the species physiological performance at different temperatures which it naturally experiences during diel vertical migration as well as its capacity to physiologically adapt to seven consecutive days of starvation. Moulting rates, metabolic rates, carbon demand, total lipid and protein contents, citrate synthase activity and kinetics, C:N ratios and stable isotope ratios were measured. These parameters were used to estimate the species physiological condition and adaptive capability within the nutritionally poly-pulsed Benguela upwelling system to cope with short periods of food absence. Moulting rates correlated negatively with temperature. Metabolic rates followed the Q(10) rule and declined significantly over the starvation period. Decreasing trends in the other parameters similarly suggest an adaptation to remain metabolically efficient. Ammonium excretion rates, oxygen to nitrogen ratios and stable isotopes showed strong distinctions between regions. Considerable differences were found between regions in the nutritional condition of E. hanseni. The total lipid content and the physiological reaction to starvation are different from euphausiids from other latitudes and help to define E. hanseni as a true upwelling organism.

It is an opportunistic feeder of Antarctic krill and the fluoride in the krill carapace is apparently not toxic. We investigated the interactive effect of fluoride, elevated temperatures, and low salinity on the plasmatic constituents of this Antarctic fish. The experiments were conducted at the Brazilian Antarctic Station Comandante Ferraz (EACF), located on King George Island. The Antarctic fish N. rossii was acclimatized to eight thermo-saline-trophic conditions, combining two temperatures (0 and 4 A degrees C), two salinities (35 and 20), and two trophic conditions (with/without fluoride) for an 11-day period. Trophic fluoride was not able to alter the plasmatic levels of glucose, cholesterol, plasmatic protein, Cl-, Mg2+, Ca2+, and inorganic phosphate, but induced an acute elevation of triglycerides at 0 A degrees C and salinity of 35. At low salinity, hyperglycemia, hypertriglyceridemia, and hypocalcemia were observed. The thermo-saline interaction at 4 A degrees C was able to minimize the effects of fluoride and low salinity on the plasmatic constituents levels.

J	Huenerlage, K; Buchholz, F				Huenerlage, Kim; Buchholz, Friedrich			Thermal limits of krill species from the high-Arctic Kongsfjord (Spitsbergen)	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												The high-Arctic Kongsfjord is mainly influenced by cold Arctic water, but also receives input of warmer water from the Atlantic. In recent years, the proportion of Atlantic inflow from the south has increased. Concurrently, one temperate-boreal (Meganyctiphanes norvegica) and one subtropical-temperate (Nematoscelis megalops) krill species are now regularly found in the Kongsfjord, in addition to the previously prevailing arcto-boreal species Thysanoessa inermis and T. raschii. In light of the recent changes in these species' biogeographic distributions, we compared their physiological tolerances. Using non-invasive optical oxygen sensors, respiration measurements served to characterize metabolic responses to temperature variations. The 2 Thysanoessa spp. appeared more cold-stenotherm than the other 2 krill species: the upper level of their respiratory capacity was reached at 12 degrees C and they were less tolerant of decreasing oxygen concentrations. This finding is consistent with their arcto-boreal distribution. In contrast, M. norvegica and N. megalops exhibited higher tolerance to temperature changes, robust nutritional condition and sexual maturity. Such physiological plasticity may explain the recent northward expansion of these species' geographic range.

Winter and spring controls on the summer food web of the coastal West Antarctic Peninsula	NATURE COMMUNICATIONS												Understanding the mechanisms by which climate variability affects multiple trophic levels in food webs is essential for determining ecosystem responses to climate change. Here we use over two decades of data collected by the Palmer Long Term Ecological Research program (PAL-LTER) to determine how large-scale climate and local physical forcing affect phytoplankton, zooplankton and an apex predator along the West Antarctic Peninsula (WAP). We show that positive anomalies in chlorophyll-a (chl-a) at Palmer Station, occurring every 4-6 years, are constrained by physical processes in the preceding winter/spring and a negative phase of the Southern Annular Mode (SAM). Favorable conditions for phytoplankton included increased winter ice extent and duration, reduced spring/summer winds, and increased water column stability via enhanced salinity-driven density gradients. Years of positive chl-a anomalies are associated with the initiation of a robust krill cohort the following summer, which is evident in Adelie penguin diets, thus demonstrating tight trophic coupling. Projected climate change in this region may have a significant, negative impact on phytoplankton biomass, krill recruitment and upper trophic level predators in this coastal Antarctic ecosystem.

J	Tarling, GA				Tarling, GA			Sex-dependent diel vertical migration in northern krill Meganyctiphanes norvegica and its consequences for population dynamics	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												The diel vertical migration (DVM) and population dynamics of northern krill were investigated in the Clyde Sea over several years using depth-discrete net-sampling and a moored 300 kHz acoustic Doppler current profiler. Krill performed DVM throughout each year of sampling. The respective arrival and departure of the krill scattering layer to and from the upper layers occurred consistently 30 min after sunset and 30 min before sunrise. DVM of males and females was different, with females migrating closer to the surface at night than males of equivalent size. The sex ratio was initially 1:1 when juveniles matured into adults after their first winter, but the ratio became increasingly biased towards males as the season progressed such that, by October, the ratio was close to 3:1. A deterministic individual-based model, in which predation risk was a function of the light available to visual predators, showed that the bias could be accounted for by the difference in risk taken by males and females as a result of their DVMs. The same model also showed that, during summer, the difference in these DVMs resulted in females making a net energy gain that was 40% higher than that of males. The predicted net energy gain for females met the immediate energetic demand for egg production as well as providing a surplus that could offset any future decline in food availability. The model did not predict the observation that the decline in male numbers was greater than that of females over the winter. This may be a result of females being more able to cope with starvation through reabsorption of their lipid-rich ovaries. The greater demand for energy to fuel reproduction appeared to be driving females to undertake a riskier DVM than males. This drive is likely to be common to most euphausiid species.																	0171-8630	1616-1599					2003	260						173	188		10.3354/meps260173							WOS:000186420500015

Comparative morphology of Southern Ocean Euphausia species: ecological significance of sexual dimorphic features	POLAR BIOLOGY												Species of the genus Euphausia dominate the euphausiid biomass of the Southern Ocean, the three largest being Euphausia superba, E. triacantha and E. crystallorophias. We measured a number of morphological features to identify differences between, and within, these species to obtain ecological insights. Interspecifically, the greatest difference was carapace size, with that of E. superba being by far the largest and most variable. This likely reflects its prolific spawning capacity compared with other euphausiid species. E. triacantha exhibited an extended sixth abdominal segment that could facilitate greater levels of thrust in the tail flip escape response. The pleopods, which provide propulsion in forward swimming, were more than 50% larger in E. superba, indicating a greater capacity for directional movement at high velocities. E. crystallorophias had eyes that were almost double the size of those in E. superba and E. triacantha, which may help retain visual resolution within its under-ice habitat. Intraspecifically, we found the above morphological features differed little between sexes and developmental stages in E. crystallorophias and E. triacantha, but differed significantly in E. superba. Compared to females and juveniles, male E. superba had significantly larger eyes and pleopods, whilst the carapace in males became shorter as a proportion of body length during growth. These features indicate a greater capacity for searching and swimming in males, which, we hypothesise, increases their ability to locate and fertilise females. This morphological specialisation in male E. superba is indicative of comparatively greater inter-male competition resulting from its tendency to form large, dense swarms.

J	Quillfeldt, P				Quillfeldt, P			Variation in breeding success in Wilson's storm petrels: influence of environmental factors	ANTARCTIC SCIENCE												The climatic and sea ice conditions of the Southern Ocean are highly variable within and between years, and a better understanding of the influence of climatic conditions on the various parts of the marine food chain is needed. This paper summarizes data on breeding success of a krill-dependent predator, the Wilson's storm petrel Oceanites oceanicus, in a colony on King George Island, South Shetland Islands, Antarctica, over four breeding seasons from 1995/1996 to 1999/2000. The seasons differed greatly in environmental conditions and in the resulting food availability which was reflected in inter- and intra-annual variations in feeding frequency. The breeding success was consequently variable. Starvation, the main cause of chick mortality in three out of four breeding seasons was associated with reduced sea ice cover in winter, which is known to depress food availability in the following breeding season. Food delivery rates also depended on the prevailing winds, which drive the transport of zooplankton-rich water masses. Snowstorms caused additional chick mortality in two out of four seasons when nest burrows became blocked. Implications for the use of Wilson's storm petrels for monitoring of krill are considered.

Bacterial community composition in Ad,lie (Pygoscelis adeliae) and Chinstrap (Pygoscelis antarctica) Penguin stomach contents from Signy Island, South Orkney Islands	POLAR BIOLOGY												Penguin stomach microbiota and its variability are important as these microbes may contribute to the fitness of the host birds and their chicks, and influence the microbial ecosystem of the surrounding soils. However, there is relatively little knowledge in this area, with the majority of studies focused on their deposited faeces. Here we investigated whether similar foraging strategies in adjacent colonies of different penguin species lead to similar temporarily conserved stomach microbiota. To do this, we studied the inter- and intra-specific variations in bacterial community composition in the stomach contents of sympatrically breeding Ad,lie (Pygoscelis adeliae) and Chinstrap (Pygoscelis antarctica) Penguins, which consumed a diet of 100% Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) under a similar foraging regime on Signy Island (maritime Antarctic), using a high-throughput DNA sequencing approach. Our data show that Ad,lie and Chinstrap Penguins shared 23-63% similarity in the stomach bacterial community composition, with no significant differences observed in the alpha-diversity or the assemblages of frequently encountered groups of operational taxonomic units (OTUs). The most frequently encountered OTUs that were shared between the species represented members of the phyla Fusobacteria, Firmicutes, Tenericutes and Proteobacteria. OTUs which were unique to individual birds and to single species formed approximately half of the communities identified, suggesting that stomach microbiota variability can occur in penguins that forage and breed under similar environmental conditions.

Antarctic Peninsula. Species composition suggested the area was a faunal transition zone between oceanic and nearshore communities. In a comparison between the study area and two oceanic areas, four of the top five numerically dominant species were identical (Euphausia superba, Salpa thompsoni, Thysanoessa macrura and Sagitta gazellae). In the nearshore region a mysid (Antarctomysis ohlinii) replaced the oceanic chaetognath Euhrohnia hamata in numerical ranking. E. superba was primarily responsible for the much higher nearshore biomass values when compared with those of oceanic regions (52.6 vs 2.4-3.1 g DM/m(2)). The ctenophore Callianira antarctica, the mysid A. ohlinii, and the pelagic notothemid fish Pleuragramma antarcticum were important neritic biomass species. Some oceanic species, notably S. thompsoni and the mesopelagic fish Electrona antaretica, were also important contributors to total micronektonic biomass. Fish predation by P. antarcticum and E. antaretica on E. superba (assuming constant fish and krill populations through the season that was sampled, the austral fall (90 d), and using our daily consumption values) is estimated at 2.5% and 2.9% of the total krill numbers, respectively, mostly on the juvenile segment of the population. Krill densities vary considerably in time and space, while available data suggest that pelagic fishes show less seasonal and spatial change. The most likely explanation for those observations is that the fishes are reliably more vulnerable to sampling gear than krill, but it also implies a consistent low level of fish predation on krill throughout the year, particularly on juveniles.

The population structure of N. rossii (n = 221) was composed of juveniles, and that of N. coriiceps (n = 151) was composed of adults. The greatest mean length and weight measurements of N. coriiceps may be related to warming waters in the Antarctic Peninsula region. Salps were the dominant item in the diet of both species responsible for high protein quantity item found in muscle tissues and liver. The krill and amphipods were an important food item and related to lipid reserves. Among the indices evaluated, greater variation was observed in the hepatosomatic index of N. coriiceps and was related to the greater sizes and ages attained by this species. The liver and muscle energetic components showed great variability between different months may be related by the variability in diet. The plasma components did not exhibit seasonal patterns but displayed large monthly variation. Long-term analysis of the biological parameters evaluated in this study should be continued to monitor the species present in Admiralty Bay, a region with great biological diversity.

Mature, adult Euphausia superba was the staple diet of fur seals at Nyroysa, while squid and myctophid fish appeared to be taken opportunistically. In metric tons, the total Bouvetoya fur seal population is estimated to have consumed a minimum of 14,365 t krill (representing 1.2713 x 10(10) individuals of 1.13 g mass), 186 t fish, 184 t squid and 14,735 t over 3 months, but there are many possible sources of error in these estimates.

A description of the post-naupliar development of Southern Ocean krill (Thysanoessa macrura)	POLAR BIOLOGY												Southern Ocean krill (Thysanoessa macrura) is one of the most abundant euphausiid species in the Southern Ocean. Despite a wide distribution and high abundance this species remains poorly understood. Unique ecological traits of this species, including a late-winter reproductive period, highly omnivorous diet and large lipid deposits within the carapace, suggest T. macrura is attuned to the seasonal patterns of the Southern Ocean. The absence of the descriptions of T. macrura larval stages limits the development of a comprehensive understanding of the early life-history of this species. Here, I provide the first detailed descriptions of the post-naupliar larval developmental stages of T. macrura with accompanying photographic documentation. Three calyptopis and 6 furcilia stages were identified and described for T. macrura, providing an accessible guide for their identification in both historical samples and for future investigations.

Marine microbes are an essential part of the marine food web and are a critical link in biogeochemical processes in the ocean, such as the cycling of nutrients and carbon. Despite this, the response of Antarctic marine microbial communities to ocean acidification is poorly understood. We investigated the effect of increasing fCO(2) on the growth of heterotrophic nanoflagellates (HNFs), nano- and picophytoplankton, and prokaryotes (heterotrophic Bacteria and Archaea) in a natural coastal Antarctic marine microbial community from Prydz Bay, East Antarctica. At CO2 levels >= 634 mu atm, HNF abundance was reduced, coinciding with increased abundance of picophytoplankton and prokaryotes. This increase in picophytoplankton and prokaryote abundance was likely due to a reduction in top-down control of grazing HNFs. Nanophytoplankton abundance was elevated in the 634 mu atm treatment, suggesting that moderate increases in CO2 may stimulate growth. The taxonomic and morphological differences in CO2 tolerance we observed are likely to favour dominance of microbial communities by prokaryotes, nanophytoplankton, and picophytoplankton. Such changes in predator-prey interactions with ocean acidification could have a significant effect on the food web and biogeochemistry in the Southern Ocean, intensifying organic-matter recycling in surface waters; reducing vertical carbon flux; and reducing the quality, quantity, and availability of food for higher trophic levels.

Combined with biomass of the krill community, the grazing potential on phytoplankton along the fjord was estimated. Gut evacuation rates were 3.9 and 2.3 h(-1) for T. raschii and T. inermis, respectively. Ingestion rates were 12.2 +/- A 7.5 A mu g C mg C-1 day(-1) (n = 4) for T. inermis and 4.9 +/- A 3.2 A mu g C mg C-1 day(-1) (n = 4) for T. raschii, corresponding to daily rations of 1.2 and 0.5 % body carbon day(-1). Clearance experiments conducted in parallel to the gut evacuation experiment gave similar results for ingestion rates and daily rations. Krill biomass was highest in the central part of the fjord's length, with T. raschii dominating. Community grazing rates from krill and copepods were comparable; however, their combined impact was low, estimated as < 1 % of phytoplankton standing stock being removed per day during this late spring study.

To this end, we deployed baited cameras at 20 locations along similar to 500 km of the Western Antarctic Peninsula (WAP) at depths from 90 to 797 m. We identified 111 unique taxa, with mud bottom accounting for 90% of the dominant (>= 50% cover) habitat sampled. Amphipoda comprised 41% of the total maximum number of individuals per camera deployment (MaxN) and occurred on 75% of deployments. Excluding this taxon, the highest MaxN occurred around King George/25 de Mayo Island and was driven primarily by the abundance of krill (Euphausiidae), which accounted for 36% of total average MaxN among deployments around this island. In comparison, krill comprised 22% of total average MaxN at Deception Island and only 10% along the peninsula. Taxa richness, diversity, and evenness all increased with depth and depth explained 18.2% of the variation in community structure among locations, which may be explained by decreasing ice scour with depth. We identified a number of Vulnerable Marine Ecosystem taxa, including habitat-forming species of cold-water corals and sponge fields. Chan-nichthyidae was the most common fish family, occurring on 80% of all deployments. The Antarctic jonasfish (Notolepis coatsorum) was the most frequently encountered fish taxa, occurring on 70% of all deployments and comprising 25% of total MaxN among all deployments. Nototheniidae was the most numerically abundant fish family, accounting for 36% of total MaxN and was present on 70% of the deployments. The WAP is among the fastest warming regions on Earth and mitigating the impacts of warming, along with more direct impacts such as those from fishing, is critical in providing opportunities for species to adapt to environmental change and to preserve this unique ecosystem.

Antarctic Futures: An Assessment of Climate-Driven Changes in Ecosystem Structure, Function, and Service Provisioning in the Southern Ocean	ANNUAL REVIEW OF MARINE SCIENCE, VOL 12	Annual Review of Marine Science											In this article, we analyze the impacts of climate change on Antarctic marine ecosystems. Observations demonstrate large-scale changes in the physical variables and circulation of the Southern Ocean driven by warming, stratospheric ozone depletion, and a positive Southern Annular Mode. Alterations in the physical environment are driving change through all levels of Antarctic marine food webs, which differ regionally. The distributions of key species, such as Antarctic krill, are also changing. Differential responses among predators reflect differences in species ecology. The impacts of climate change on Antarctic biodiversity will likely vary for different communities and depend on species range. Coastal communities and those of sub-Antarctic islands, especially range-restricted endemic communities, will likely suffer the greatest negative consequences of climate change. Simultaneously, ecosystem services in the Southern Ocean will likely increase. Such decoupling of ecosystem services and endemic species will require consideration in the management of human activities such as fishing in Antarctic marine ecosystems.

J	Buchholz, CM; Buchholz, F; Tarling, GA				Buchholz, Cornelia M.; Buchholz, Friedrich; Tarling, Geraint A.			On the timing of moulting processes in reproductively active Northern krill Meganyctiphanes norvegica	MARINE BIOLOGY												The interactions between moult phasing, growth and environmental cues in Northern krill (Meganyctiphanes norvegica) were examined through analysing populations at seasonal, weekly, and daily timescales. The analyses were carried out on resident populations of krill found in three different neritic locations that experience similar environmental signals (the Clyde Sea, Scotland; the Kattegat, Denmark; Gullmarsfjord, Sweden). Seasonal analyses were carried out on the Clyde Sea population and showed that moulting frequency increased significantly moving from winter to summer. The proportion of moulting females in summer samples was often more than double the proportion of moulting males, suggesting that females had a comparatively shorter intermoult period (IMP). Weekly samples taken from the Kattegat showed a similar pattern. However, although the difference between the proportion of female and male moulters was significant in one week, it was not another, mainly because of the variability in the proportion of female moulters. Such variability in females was equally evident in the daily samples taken at Gullmarsfjord. It suggests that females have a shorter IMP (12.5 days) than males (18.4 days) and are more likely to moult in synchrony. Nevertheless, the daily samples revealed that males are also capable of moult synchronisation, although less frequently than females. Shortened IMPs in females were not a result of the abbreviation of specific moult stages. Accordingly, reproductive activity did not alter the course of the normal moult cycle. There was no significant difference between the total body lengths of males and females indicating that females achieve the same levels of growth despite moulting more frequently and having to provision the energy-rich ovaries. This is in contrast to most other crustaceans where the energy costs of reproduction reduce female growth. The fact that females were less abundant than males, probably by suffering a greater level of mortality, suggests that different behavioural strategies, particularly vertical migration regimes, were adopted by each sex to maximise growth and reproduction.

In a 25,000 km2 sampling area at the western end of Bransfield Strait and during the period from mid-December 1986 to late March 1987, four 2-week cruises were made over a 69-station grid encompassing the coastal shelf, the continental shelf break, numerous island shelves, the Bellingshausen Sea-Weddell Sea confluence, and a portion of Drake Passage. Studies were focused on the upper ocean (0-200 m) and included detailed measurements of hydrography, ocean optics, vertical flux, and the distribution, abundance and productivity of bacteria, phytoplankton, zooplankton and krill. This paper describes the program logistics and presents the results of a carbon flux model, based on empirical observations, for the nearshore pelagic marine ecosystem.

AQUACULTURE												Releasing hatchery-reared juveniles in the wild can mitigate the general decline in the natural stocks of European lobster, Homarus gammarus, L.. However, growth and survival rates in lobster culture are low, presumably due to suboptimal nutrition and feeding. With the aim of determining appropriate nutrient levels, we tested different formulated extruded feeds for the culture of juvenile European lobster. Baseline metabolism (standard metabolic rate, SMR), in combination with the metabolic cost of feeding (specific dynamic action, SDA), and nitrogen retention during digestion and assimilation was investigated for six experimental diets. Diets were formulated to contain two different levels of protein (400 and 500 g kg(-1)), with three lipid to carbohydrate (L:CHO) ratios (low, medium, and high). These experimental diets were tested over a 32-day period, against a conventional control diet (Antarctic krill, Euphausia superba). During this period, the growth performance of the juveniles was assessed as molting frequency, increments in carapace length and whole body wet weight. At the end of the growth performance trial, oxygen consumption (MO2) and nitrogen excretion rates of individual lobsters were determined prior to and following the ingestion of a single meal. Molting occurred more frequently in juveniles fed with krill and krill resulted in a significantly higher specific growth rate than experimental dry feeds except for the 500-low diet. However, lobsters fed any of the three 500 and the 400-low diets had carapace length increments, SMR, SDA, and nitrogen retention similar to those fed the krill diet. Results suggest that protein is an important macronutrient for juveniles of this species and must be included above 40%. Also, lobsters have a dietary requirement for carbohydrates ranging from 24% to 35% probably related to the need for glycogen in chitin synthesis. The lower the protein content, the higher the requirement in carbohydrates.

J	Burrows, MT; Tarling, G				Burrows, MT; Tarling, G			Effects of density dependence on diel vertical migration of populations of northern krill: a Genetic Algorithm model	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												Net and acoustic studies of diel vertical migration (DVM) in krill often show a degree of dispersion around the mean population depth, which becomes greater during night-time. Trade-off models can predict optimum depths over diet cycles but rarely explain why there is vertical scatter and why aggregations disperse at certain times. We examined density-dependent factors as a potential explanation for these phenomena. A Genetic Algorithm model was developed that predicted DVM,in a krill population based on internal state (i.e. levels of energy reserves), risk of predation and location of conspecifics. The modelling approach was designed to be dynamic in that optimal policies could respond to changing circumstances through time. Parameterisation of the model was achieved through measurements made in the Clyde Sea Area on northern krill Meganyctiphanes norvegica and its environment. Light intensity at depth was used to assess the level of risk of visual predation. Food provision was a mixture of vertically stratified phytoplankton and vertically migrating copepods. A negative exponential function was used to simulate density dependence in the food returns at each depth. Sensitivity analyses involved alterations to the level of density dependence and the metabolic rate. DVM was predicted in all sensitivity analyses and each correlated positively with net catch and acoustic observations. Increased density dependence in feeding success did not affect the mean depths chosen at night but did increase the spread of the population. The closest fit to observations was achieved when the metabolic rate was lowered and risk of mortality rate was assessed over a yearly rather than daily period. The model predicted that the population should spread more under low food conditions. We recommend that density-dependent factors be included in future state-dependent models predicting krill behaviour and life-cycle patterns.

Surface and near surface potential TS properties indicated the presence of three water types: a near-shore group of stations characterised by water which became progressively warmer and fresher closer to South Georgia, an offshore grouping in which sea surface temperatures and those at the winter water level were relatively warm (1.8degreesC and 0.5degreesC, respectively), and a third in which surface and winter water temperatures were cooler and reflected the presence of the SACCF. The transect bisected the SACCF twice, revealing that it was flowing in opposite directions, north-westward closest to South Georgia and south-eastwards at its furthest point from the island. The innermost limb was a narrow intense feature located just off the shelf break in 2000-3500m of water and in which rapid surface baroclinic velocities (up to 35cm s(-1)) were encountered. Offshore in the outermost limb, shown subsequently to be a mesoscale eddy that had meandered south from the retroflected limb of the SACCF, flow was broader and slower with peak velocities around 20cm s(-1). Chlorophyll a biomass was generally low (< 1 mg m(-3)) over much of the transect but increased dramatically in the region of the innermost limb of the SACCF, where a deepening of the surface mixed layer was coincident with a subsurface chlorophyll maximum (7.4 mg m(-3)) and elevated concentrations down to 100m. The bloom was coincident with depleted nutrient concentrations, particularly silicate, nitrate and phosphate, and although ammonium concentrations were locally depleted the bloom lay within an elevated band (up to 1.5 mmol m(-3)) associated with the frontal jet. Increased zooplankton abundance, higher copepod body carbon mass and egg production rates all showed a strong spatial integrity with the front. The population structure of the copepods Calanoides acutus and Rhincalanus gigas at stations within the front suggested that rather than simply resulting from entrainment and concentration within the jet, increased copepod abundance was the result of development in situ. Estimates of bloom duration, based on silicate and carbon budget calculations, set the likely duration between 82 and 122d, a figure supported by the development schedule of the two copepod species. Given this timescale, model outputs from FRAM and OCCAM indicated that particles that occurred on the north side of South Georgia in December would have been in the central-southern Scotia Sea 2-3 months earlier, probably in sea ice affected regions.

J	Staniland, IJ; Pond, DW				Staniland, IJ; Pond, DW			Investigating the use of milk fatty acids to detect dietary changes: a comparison with faecal analysis in Antarctic fur seals	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												We compared the use of fatty acid signature analysis with results from traditional faecal methods using milk samples and enemas concurrently collected from 8 female Antarctic fur seals Arctocephalus gazella foraging from Bird Island, South Georgia. The seals were serially sampled throughout the 1998/1999 breeding season, with collections taken after every foraging trip when possible. The total lipid content of the milk increased throughout the season. A general linear model using 4 principal components showed that it was the point within the breeding season at which a milk sample was collected that had the biggest influence on its fatty acid composition, There were also significant differences in the milk composition of individual seals. However, the results of faecal analysis, which are themselves subject to potential biases, were not correlated with the relative amounts of individual fatty acids. It has been suggested that seasonal changes in the milk fatty acids, previously observed in the same population of seals, are a result of increased consumption of fish. We found no evidence of this in the faecal material and suggest that the seasonal variability may be a result of changes in the fatty acid composition of the seals' main prey (krill), or because of the changing needs of the developing pups. This study highlights the need for comprehensive testing of milk fatty acid signature analysis before the full potential of this technique can be realised.

Distribution, abundance and ecological relevance of pelagic fishes in the Lazarev Sea, Southern Ocean	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												The distribution and abundance of larval and postlarval fishes was investigated in the Lazarev Sea, Southern Ocean, in March and April 2004. The upper 200 m of the water column were sampled with an 8 m(2) rectangular midwater trawl at 93 stations. The larval species community clustered in a diverse coastal community with high densities of Antarctic silverfish Pleuragramma antarcticum larvae and a less diverse offshore community dominated by Antarctic jonasfish Notolepis coatsi and the lanternfish Electrona antarctica. No postlarval fish were caught in coastal areas. The offshore community of postlarval fishes consisted of the deep-sea smelt Bathylagus antarcticus, and the lanternfishes Gymnoscopelus braueri, G. nicholsi and E. antarctica. The latter species clearly dominated, occurring at mean individual and wet mass densities of 0.17 individuals m(-2) and 0.26 g m(-2), respectively. A generalized additive model significantly related the density of postlarval E. antarctica to the abundance of Antarctic krill Euphausia superba, ocean depth and sea surface temperature. The diet of E. antarctica was dominated by copepods and euphausiid larvae. Mean energy density of E. antarctica in the upper 200 m was 2.8 kJ m(-2), which is equivalent to 36% of the energy stored in Antarctic krill stocks and probably would be considerably higher if a greater depth range were considered. This suggests that E. antarctica is a major energy transmitter in the food web of the Lazarev Sea, challenging the classical krill-dominated food web paradigm of the Southern Ocean.

The experiments were carried out with 24 male rabbits randomly divided into four groups: KO-castrated, treated with KO; FO-castrated, treated with FO; C-castrated, non-treated; NC-non-castrated, non-treated. At the end of treatment period (2 months), an intravenous glucose tolerance test (IVGTT) was performed in all rabbits. Fasting blood glucose concentrations in FO and KO animals were significantly lower than in group C. The blood glucose concentrations in FO- and KO-treated animals returned to initial values after 30 and 60 min of IVGTT, respectively. In liver, carnitine palmitoyltransferase 2 (Cpt2) and 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-CoA synthase 2 (Hmgcs2) genes were significantly increased in FO-fed rabbits compared with the C group. Acetyl-CoA carboxylase alpha (Acaca) expression was significantly reduced in both KO- and FO-fed rabbits. In skeletal muscle, Hmgcs2 and Cd36 were significantly higher in KO-fed rabbits compared with the C group. Acaca expression was significantly lower in KO- and FO-fed rabbits compared with the C group. The present results indicate that FO and KO supplementation decreases fasting blood glucose and improves glucose tolerance in obese New Zealand white rabbits. This could be ascribed to the ameliorated insulin sensitivity and insulin secretion and modified gene expressions of some key enzymes involved in beta-oxidation and lipogenesis in liver and skeletal muscle.

Crabeater seal diving behaviour in eastern Antarctica	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												Southern Ocean waters are highly productive and contain important food resources for many indigenous predators, including humans. Management of these resources has fallen under the regulation of the Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR), which has identified a suite of predators as indicator species for monitoring ecosystem fluctuations, including crabeater seals. For crabeater seals to fulfil this role, however, they must respond predictably to fluctuations in krill distribution and abundance. Here, we investigated the validity of using the diving behaviour of this species as an indicator of krill distribution and abundance. We used behavioural data collected from 23 crabeater seals fitted with satellite-linked time-depth recorders off eastern Antarctica to quantify habitat use as a function of the amount of time they spent within geographic regions with varying environmental characteristics. This was then linked with diving behaviour in those regions. By integrating geographic location and diving parameters, we demonstrated that habitat use and foraging behaviour within eastern Antarctic waters fluctuated in response to seasonal and spatial environmental variability. Our attempts to use oceanographic variables to develop models of crabeater seal habitat use and behaviour demonstrated real limitations in inferring behaviour from a simple set of environmental factors, but we identified ocean depth and the proximity to the ice edge as factors influencing seasonal habitat use and diving behaviour. Whilst our understanding of the influences driving crabeater seal distribution has improved as a result of telemetry studies, it would appear premature to infer cross-species patterns in distribution and abundance with krill given the low predictive power of models derived in the present study. Furthermore, the dynamic and regionally variable use of pelagic habitat by this widely abundant Antarctic predator has important implications for the estimation of crabeater seal biomass.

We examined the delta(15)N and delta(13)C values of Antarctic euphausiids and copepods from the Polar Front, Lazarev Sea, and Marguerite Bay against their foodweb baseline of particulate organic matter (POM). Interpretations of trophic level were helped by comparison with other approaches and by calibration experiments with Euphausia superba fed known diets: Results for well-known mesozooplankters (e.g., Calanoides acutus and Metridia gerlachei) were internally consistent and corresponded to those derived from independent methods. This gave confidence in the isotope approach for copepods and probably larval euphausiids. Among the dominant yet poorly known species, it suggested mainly herbivory for Rhincalanus gigas but omnivory for Calanus simillimus and furcilia larvae of Thysanoessa spp. and Euphausia frigida. The delta(15)N values of adult copepods were up to 3parts per thousand higher than those of early copepodites, pointing to ontogenetic shifts in diet. In the Lazarev Sea in autumn, the isotopic signals of E. superba larvae suggested pelagic, mainly herbivorous, feeding rather than feeding within the ice. In contrast to the mesozooplankton, some anomalous results for postlarval krill species indicated problems with this method for micronekton. The experiments showed that postlarval E. superba did not equilibriate with a new diet within 30 d. We suggest that the slower turnover of these larger species, partly in combination with their ability to migrate, has confounded trophic effects with those of a temporally/spatially changing food-web baseline. Interpretations of food sources of micronekton could be helped by analyzing their molts or fecal pellets, which responded faster to a new diet.

Abundance and breeding distribution of seabirds in the northern part of the Danco Coast, Antarctic Peninsula	POLAR RESEARCH												Seabird abundances and breeding distribution have the potential to serve as ecological indicators. The western Antarctic Peninsula is one of the three sites in the world with the greatest increases in local temperature during the last 50 years. The aim of this study was to monitor the distribution and abundance of breeding populations of seabirds in the northern sector of the Danco Coast, north-west of the Antarctic Peninsula, during the breeding season 2010/11. The birds were the Wilson's storm petrel (Oceanites oceanicus), South Polar skua (Stercorarius maccormicki), kelp gull (Larus dominicanus), Antarctic tern (Sterna vittata), snowy sheathbill (Chionis alba), chinstrap penguin (Pygoscelis antarctica), southern giant petrel (Macronectes giganteus), gentoo penguin (Pygoscelis papua), Cape petrel (Daption capense) and Antarctic shag (Phalacrocorax bransfieldensis). Annual breeding population growth increased in pygoscelids, southern giant petrel and sheathbill, and for the remaining species, breeding population trends were stable. Given that seabird populations can provide valuable information on the conditions of their feeding and nesting environments, this study highlights the need to maintain basics monitoring studies.

Differing foraging strategies influence mercury (Hg) exposure in an Antarctic penguin community	ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION												Seabirds are ideal model organisms to track mercury (Hg) through marine food webs as they are long-lived, broadly distributed, and are susceptible to biomagnification due to foraging at relatively high trophic levels. However, using these species as biomonitors requires a solid understanding of the degree of species, sexual and age-specific variation in foraging behaviors which act to mediate their dietary exposure to Hg. We combined stomach content analysis along with Hg and stable isotope analyses of blood, feathers and common prey items to help explain inter and intra-specific patterns of dietary Hg exposure across three sympatric Pygoscelis penguin species commonly used as biomonitors of Hg availability in the Antarctic marine ecosystem. We found that penguin tissue Hg concentrations differed across species, between adults and juveniles, but not between sexes. While all three penguins species diets were dominated by Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) and to a lesser extent fish, stable isotope based proxies of relative trophic level and krill consumption could not by itself sufficiently explain the observed patterns of inter and intra-specific variation in Hg. However, integrating isotopic approaches with stomach content analysis allowed us to identify the relatively higher risk of Hg exposure for penguins foraging on mesopelagic prey relative to congeners targeting epipelagic or benthic prey species. When possible, future seabird biomonitoring studies should seek to combine isotopic approaches with other, independent measures of foraging behavior to better account for the confounding effects of inter and intra-specific variation on dietary Hg exposure.

Effect of 1 Year Krill Oil Supplementation on Cognitive Achievement of Dutch Adolescents: A Double-Blind Randomized Controlled Trial	NUTRIENTS												Long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFA) are important for brain development and function, maybe especially during adolescence. Observational studies have demonstrated an association between fish consumption (a source of LCPUFA) and cognition in adolescents, but intervention trials are lacking. The goal of the current study was to investigate the effect of one year of krill oil (a source of LCPUFA) supplementation on the cognitive performance of adolescents with a low Omega-3 Index (O3I <= 5%). A double-blind, randomized, and placebo-controlled supplementation trial with repeated measurements (baseline (T0), three months (T1), six months (T2), and 12 months (T3)) in adolescents (267 randomized) was executed. Participants were randomized to 400 mg eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) per day in Cohort I or placebo and 800 mg EPA + DHA per day in Cohort II or placebo. O3I was monitored by a finger prick at all time points. At T0, T2, and T3, participants executed a neurocognitive test battery. Covariate corrected mixed models were run with either condition (krill or placebo) or O3I as predictors. Krill oil supplementation led to a small but significant increase in mean O3I, but few participants increased to the intended O3I range (8-11%). There was no significant effect of supplementation on the neurocognitive tests, nor a relationship between O3I and neurocognitive test scores. The increase in O3I was small in most participants, probably due to non-compliance. Possibly the increase in O3I was too small to demonstrate an effect. More research on the influence of LCPUFAs on cognition in adolescents is needed.					von Schacky, Clemens/0000-0001-6022-6624; Kirschner, Paul A./0000-0002-8743-0462													2072-6643				JUN	2019	11	6							1230	10.3390/nu11061230							WOS:000474936700036	31151199

There have been no reports on the miRNAs of the Antarctic krill Euphausia superba despite the specie's crucial position in Antarctic food webs. Two small RNA libraries were constructed from eyestalk and muscle, subsequently, and deep sequencing analysis was performed to investigate and profile E. superba miRNAs. A total of 19 304 586 and 23 005 104 unique sequences were obtained from the eyestalk and muscle, respectively. After compared the small RNA sequences with the Rfam database, 12 342 039 and 7 907 477 reads in eyestalk and muscle were matched to the transcriptome sequence of E. superba. A total of 236 distinct miRNAs were identified after annotation to known animal miRNAs registered in miRBase 21. In both libraries, the most abundant known miRNA were miR-750 with 92 583 reads in muscle and miR-1304-3p with 56 386 reads in eyestalk while the average value was less than 106, revealing a wide range of different expression levels. In addition, niR-277a enriched in both libraries and may be involved in modulating Krebs cycle by targeting to Vimar. Differential expression analysis showed that 56 mature miRNAs were significantly up/down regulated according to expression fold change. It appeared that the expression of several abundant miRNAs maybe tissue-specific or tissue-bias. Notably, the expression pattern of miR-750 and miR-1 family, which was suggested as the crucial candidates, involved in muscle development. Taken together, this study provides the first miRNA profile of E. superba and some of these miRNAs were expected to play important role in immune response, reproduction, energy metabolism, and muscle development and so on. Thus, the results provides a reference for functional studies of miRNAs in E. superba.																	2096-5508					NOV	2018	36	6			SI		2278	2287		10.1007/s00343-019-7229-7							WOS:000454629000030

J	Silverman, ED; Veit, RR				Silverman, ED; Veit, RR			Associations among Antarctic seabirds in mixed species feeding flocks	IBIS												We studied ten mixed-species feeding flocks of seabirds and seals off South Georgia (55 degreesS, 35 degreesW) to assess the factors that influenced the species composition of the flocks. The ten flocks were distributed between two oceanographic regions; four flocks were observed off the northwestern end of South Georgia, and six off the island's southeastern end. The flocks differed dramatically in size and species composition. The northwestern flocks were ten to 20 times larger and contained more seals and penguins. We tested whether these differences were a consequence of location, because the two regions were populated by different assemblages of species, and determined that this was not the case. Differences in flock size and species composition reflected differences in the depth distribution of the birds' and seals' prey. The northwestern flocks were associated with deep swarms of Antarctic krill Euphausia superba with a significant quantity of krill also present at the surface. We also tested for differential flock participation by the species found in the surrounding waters and classified species by their proclivity to participate in the flocks. Our results indicate that Black-browed Albatross Diomedea melanophris have a strong tendency to join, and diving-petrels Pelecanoides spp, to avoid, mixed-species feeding flocks. We postulate that Black-browed Albatrosses serve as visual cues to the presence of food for one another and for other species, and that diving-petrels avoid mixed-species flocks in part because of the risk of predation.																	0019-1019					JAN	2001	143	1					51	62		10.1111/j.1474-919X.2001.tb04169.x							WOS:000166159100007

Here we present results from a four-year (2003-2006) numerical simulation using a regional coupled physical-biogeochemical model to assess the Fe sources and transport on the AP shelf and toward the southern Scotia Sea. The model was validated with a suite of data derived from in situ surveys and remote sensing. Model results indicate that sediments in the AP shelf and the South Orkney Plateau (SOP) provide the dominant source of Fe to the upper 500 m in the southern Scotia Sea. Additional Fe inputs to the region are associated with the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) and the northern limb of the Weddell Gyre, deep-ocean sediment sources, dust deposition, and icebergs. Fe on the AP shelf originates primarily from sediments on the relatively shallow inner shelf and is directly injected into the water column and subsequently transported toward Elephant Island by the confluent shelf currents. Off-shelf Fe export is primarily through entrainment of shelf waters by the ACC's Southern Boundary frontal jet along the northern edge of the AP shelf, the Hesperides Trough, and the SOP shelf. About 70% of the off-shelf export takes place below the surface mixed layer, and is subsequently re-supplied to the euphotic zone through vertical mixing, mainly during austral fall and winter. The exported shelf-derived Fe is then advected downstream by the ACC and Weddell Gyre and spread over the southern and eastern Scotia Seas. Taken together, shelf Fe export witin top 500 m meets nearly all of the Fe demand of phytoplankton photosynthesis in the southern Scotia Sea. Waters with elevated Fe concentrations in the Scotia Sea are largely restricted to south of the Southern ACC Front.

J	SINIFF, DB				SINIFF, DB			AN OVERVIEW OF THE ECOLOGY OF ANTARCTIC SEALS	AMERICAN ZOOLOGIST												Four species of seals occupy the pack-ice region of the oceans surrounding the Antarctic Continent. These seals include the crabeater (Lobodon carcinophagus), Leopard (Hydrurga leptonyx), weddell (Leptonychotes weddellii), and ross and are true seals with special adaptations for living in the pack-ice region. Two other seal species, the southern elephant seal (Mirounga leonina) and the fur seal (Arctocephalus gazella) (the only eared seal of this region) generally occur further to the north and use land rather than ice during the period of birth of young. This paper reviews the status of these species, and examines the general ecology of the four species that inhabit the pack-ice zone. In general, the four species that occupy the pack-ice zone have specialized in habitats and habits so that little overlap in diets or habitat use exist among these species. The exception is the interaction between the leopard and the crabeater which occupy the same regions and eat krill (Euphausia superba), particularly during the winter. The impact of the potential harvest of krill by man on these species is discussed. Further, the impact that recovery of the large baleen whales that feed in this region during the summer is discussed with regard to the changes that might occur as competition for krill by the large vertebrate species increases.																	0003-1569						1991	31	1					143	149									WOS:A1991FD12300011						
J	Vargas, R; Osman, LP; Torres, D				Vargas, Romeo; Osman, Layla P.; Torres, Daniel			Inter-sexual differences in Antarctic fur seal pup growth rates: evidence of environmental regulation?	POLAR BIOLOGY												We investigated the variation of Antarctic fur seal (Arctocephalus gazella) pup growth rates in response to sex, breeding season and duration of both maternal foraging trip and attendance bouts. Data were collected during five consecutive rearing seasons at Cape Shirreff, the most important breeding colony in the South Shetland Islands, Antarctica. Our results showed significant interannual and sexual variations in pup growth rates. Male pups grew significantly faster than female pups during 2000, 2001, 2002 and 2004 seasons, whilst during 2003 no difference was found. The interannual variation in pup growth rates was correlated with the interannual fluctuation in maternal foraging trip and attendance bouts. There was a significant effect of pup sex and maternal foraging trip duration on pup growth rates, which varied between years having foraging trip duration a major effect during 2003, when females spent more time at sea and interestingly on that year there were no sexual differences in pup growth rates. The effect of attendance bout on pup growth rates was not significant. Diet analysis showed that Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) was the most frequent prey item during the study period. Analysis of krill size distribution showed a significant difference in krill length, during 2003, when A. gazella preyed upon the smallest sizes of krill. In this study, sex was the most important factor on pup growth rates, but when prey availability seemed more limited, there are longer foraging trips and shorter attendance bouts the sex factor became less significant.																	0722-4060	1432-2056				AUG	2009	32	8					1177	1186		10.1007/s00300-009-0615-4							WOS:000268787700008

Despite these species are largely studied, little is known about their diet outside the breeding period. In the present study, we investigated the intra-annual diet of Adelie and Emperor Penguins belonging to five colonies in the Ross Sea through the stable isotope analysis of different tissues (feathers and shell membranes), synthetized in different seasons, and guano that indicates recent diet. Penguin samples and prey (krill and fish) were collected during the Antarctic spring-summer. delta C-13 and delta N-15 of tissues and guano indicate spatio-temporal variation in the penguin diet. The krill consumption by Adelie Penguins was lowest in winter except in the northernmost colony, where it was always very high. It peaked in spring and remained prevalent in summer. The greatest krill contribution to Emperor Penguin's diet occurred in summer. The relative krill and fish consumption by both species changed in relation to the prey availability, which is influenced by seasonal sea ice dynamics, and according to the penguin life cycle phases. The results highlight a strong trophic plasticity in the Adelie Penguin, whose dietary variability has been already recognized, and in the Emperor Penguin, which had not previously reported. Our findings can help understand how these species might react to resource variation due to climate change or anthropogenic overexploitation. Furthermore, data provides useful basis for future comparisons in the Ross Sea MPA and for planning conservation actions.

C. wilsoni has been exploited on a commercial scale from the late 1970s to the end of the 1980s off Joinville-D'Urville Islands (CCAMLR Statistical Sub-area 48.1) and in the Cosmonauts and Cooperation Seas and Prydz Bay in the Indian Ocean sector (CCAMLR Statistical Division 58.4.2). This paper presents new information on biological features and life history characteristics of C. wilsoni, based on research survey collections along the northern Antarctic Peninsula in 2006 and 2007 and samples taken in the commercial fishery in 1987. Length frequency compositions from the research surveys demonstrated that fish 21-34 cm long predominated in the catches. Sexual maturity is attained at 24-25 cm. Absolute fecundity and relative fecundity is low (1,000-2,500 eggs; 6-12 eggs). Oocyte diameter varied from 4.0 to 4.9 mm very close to spawning. Spawning at the tip of the Antarctic Peninsula is likely to occur in October-November. Remotely operated vehicle deployments in the northern Weddell Sea demonstrated that C. wilsoni exhibit parental nest guarding where males protect the eggs. The incubation period is likely to be 8 months long. Fish feed primarily on Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) in the Antarctic Peninsula region and in the Cosmonauts and Cooperation Seas while fish take ice krill (Euphausia crystallorophias), Pleuragramma antarcticum and myctophids to some extent in other areas. Age determination still awaits validation. Preliminary ageing attempts suggested a maximum age of about 8-10 years.																	0722-4060					FEB	2008	31	3					381	393		10.1007/s00300-007-0366-z							WOS:000252193100013						
J	D'Amico, VL; Coria, N; Palacios, MG; Barbosa, A; Bertellotti, M				D'Amico, Veronica L.; Coria, Nestor; Gabriela Palacios, Maria; Barbosa, Andres; Bertellotti, Marcelo			Physiological differences between two overlapped breeding Antarctic penguins in a global change perspective	POLAR BIOLOGY					11th Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research Symposium	JUL 16-19, 2013	Barcelona, SPAIN					Global change has affected the Antarctic Peninsula influencing the abundance of krill, one of the main preys of penguins. In areas where breeding penguin populations overlap, species with a more diverse diet have generally been less affected than krill-specialist species, which have shown population declines. Human activities can add to these changes, as penguins are sensitive to anthropic impacts such as contamination. Our objective was to assess whether selected physiological parameters of Adelie and Gentoo penguins reflect their contrasting population trends in a colony located at Punta Stranger (25 de Mayo Island/King George, South Shetland Islands) where they breed sympatrically. During 2012, we assessed the leukocyte profile, heterophil to lymphocyte ratio (H/L), erythrocytic nuclear abnormalities (ENAs), hematocrit, biochemical profile, and a measure of immune function (bacterial agglutination) in adults and chicks of both species. Higher values of ENAs, indicative of genotoxic damage caused by contaminants, are in accordance with a greater sensitivity to ongoing global changes by Adelie penguins. Levels of cholesterol and triglycerides strengthen this idea since individuals could be investing more resources in energy reserves to successfully cope with challenging environmental conditions during the breeding season. The remaining physiological parameters did not provide a clear picture. Furthermore, some results could be related to differences in diet. Gentoos show greater prey diversity than Adelie penguins, incorporating a richer parasite fauna, which could explain their higher heterophils and H/L. The physiological parameters measured here serve as baseline for a sustained monitoring of these rapidly changing populations. Further physiological variables, including stress hormone and indices of oxidative stress, remain to be assessed as potential indicators of population susceptibility to global change in this system.

Numbers of grazers were experimentally manipulated in containers with natural phytoplankton assemblages. With natural levels of copepods but no krill a high (700 950 mug C . l-1, ca 30 mug chl a . l-1) phytoplankton biomass developed. In these cultures large diatoms, e.g. Corethron criophilum and chains of Thalassiosira sp., made up 80% of total phytoplankton cell carbon at the end of the experiment. In cultures with elevated numbers of copepods (5X or 10X the natural level) phytoplankton biomass was somewhat reduced (ca 23 mug chl a . l-1) compared to cultures with natural copepod abundance, but still high. Phytoplankton species composition was on the other hand greatly influenced. Instead of large diatoms these cultures were dominated by Phaeocystis pouchetii (70%) together with small Nitszchia sp. and Chaetoceros neogracile (20%). In containers with krill (both juveniles and adults), but without elevated numbers of copepods, phytoplankton biomass rapidly approached zero. With 10X the in situ level of copepods, krill first preyed on these before Corethron criophilum and Thalassiosira sp. were grazed. When krill were removed a plankton community dominated by flagellates (60-90%), e.g. Pyramimonas sp. and a Cryptophycean species, grazed by an unidentified droplet-shaped heterothrophic flagellate, developed. These flagellates were the same as those which dominated the plankton community in the Weddell Sea after the 'spring bloom'. A similar succession was observed in situ when a krill swarm grazed down a phytoplankton 'bloom' in a few hours. Our experiments show that copepods cannot control phytoplankton biomass in shipboard cultures even at artificially elevated numbers. Krill at concentrations similar to those in natural swarms have a great impact on both phytoplankton biomass and species composition in shipboard cultures. Both copepods and krill may have an impact on phytoplankton species composition and biomass in situ since the rates of phytoplankton cell division were probably artificially increased in ship-board cultures compared to natural conditions, where lower growth rates make phytoplankton more vulnerable to grazing. A similarity between phytoplankton successions in containers and in situ, especially with respect to krill grazing, supports the conclusion that grazing may structure phytoplankton communities in the Scotia-Weddell Sea.

J	Huenerlage, K; Graeve, M; Buchholz, F				Huenerlage, Kim; Graeve, Martin; Buchholz, Friedrich			Lipid composition and trophic relationships of krill species in a high Arctic fjord	POLAR BIOLOGY												Our study deals with the lipid biochemistry of the krill community in the ecosystem of the high Arctic Kongsfjord (Svalbard). During the last decades, Kongsfjord experienced a change in krill species composition due to recent increased advection of Atlantic water masses carrying characteristic boreal as well as subtropical-boreal euphausiids into the ecosystem. The lipid biochemistry and trophic relationships of the species recently inhabiting the Arctic water masses are scarcely known, although a change in a krill population may have a significant impact on the ecosystem. A comparison of nutrition and energy storage strategies, stable isotopes, lipid profiles and fatty acid compositions showed remarkable differences between the krill species. These reflected the diverse feeding behaviours and specific adaptations to the environments of their origin: the boreal Meganyctiphanes norvegica and subtropical Nematoscelis megalops appear more carnivorous and have significantly lower mean lipid contents (29 and 10 %, respectively) and a different energy storage pattern (triacylglycerols and polar lipids, respectively) than the arcto-boreal Thysanoessa inermis, which consists of up to 54 % of lipids mainly stored as wax esters (> 40 %). These differences may have significant implications for the rapidly changing marine food web of Kongsfjord-especially for higher trophic levels relying on the nutritional input of animal lipids.

The purified enzymes were identified as trypsins by LC-ESI-MS/MS analysis. The relative molecular mass of TLE I and TLE II were 33 and 32.3 kDa, respectively, with isoelectric points of 4.5 and 4.3, respectively. The TLEs showed excellent thermal stable in the crude extract and the purified TLEs were active over a wide pH (6.0-11.0) and temperature (10-70 degrees C) range. Compared with trypsins from other organisms, the purified TLEs had physiological efficiencies of 1.6-6.7-fold. The difference in Arg, Ile and Asp content might explain why E. pacifica TLEs have good thermal stability and physiological efficiency.

J	Brown, DJ; Boyd, IL; Cripps, GC; Butler, PJ				Brown, DJ; Boyd, IL; Cripps, GC; Butler, PJ			Fatty acid signature analysis from the milk of Antarctic fur seals and Southern elephant seals from South Georgia: implications for diet determination	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												Fatty acid signature analysis (FASA) makes use of specific fatty acids, as well as entire profiles, to study dietary relationships at different trophic levels. Previously, FASA has been used in marine ecosystems in which diet determination by more direct methods is difficult and sometimes misleading. This study examined fatty acid profiles in milk from 2 species of pinniped from the Southern Ocean that were expected to have highly contrasting diets. Milk samples were collected from Antarctic fur seals Arctocephalus gazella in 3 consecutive years, from 1991 to 1993 (n = 72), and from Southern elephant seals Mirounga leonina in 1988 (n = 53) at South Georgia. Lipids were extracted and fatty acid profiles determined by temperature-programmed gas chromatography. Possible prey species collected from waters around South Georgia were also analysed. Cluster analysis as well as classification and regression trees (CART) indicated that profiles from fur seals and elephant seals were significantly different. Southern elephant seal data could be distinguished from Antarctic fur seals by lower levels of the fatty acids 16:4 n1, 18:2 n6, 18:4 n3, 18:4 nl and 20:5 n3 and by higher levels of 18:0, 18:1 n9/ n11 (i.e. 18:1 n9 co-eluting with 18:1 n11) and 20:1 n9. Fatty acid signatures from the milk of Antarctic fur seals were closest to krill and fish species that were also known to feed on krill. Southern elephant seal fatty acid profiles were closest to species that are not known as krill predators such as larger notothenids and myctophids. The fatty acid profiles of Antarctic fur seals showed considerable inter-and intra-annual variability, which was congruent with diet variability detected using seat analyses. Southern elephant seals showed little variation in profile through lactation. In contrast to previous diet analyses based on examination of stomach contents, the results from FASA were consistent with a fish-based diet for Southern elephant seals.																	0171-8630	1616-1599					1999	187						251	263		10.3354/meps187251							WOS:000083830200022						
J	Berger, WH				Berger, W. H.			Cenozoic cooling, Antarctic nutrient pump, and the evolution of whales	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY					Synthesis Workshop on Paleoceanography and Paleoclimatology of the Southern Ocean	JAN, 2005	Univ Colorado, Boulder, CO		Univ Colorado			The evolution of large marine mammals and their invasion of the pelagic realm is tied to the availability of sufficient food, which in turn is linked to upwelling areas and other highly productive regions in the ocean, as has been recognized for some time. Here I propose that silicate-supported upwelling (which provides the shorter food chain and hence the higher yield for apex consumers) and deep mixing within the Southern Ocean are the crucial ingredients of the system providing the stage for the evolution of whales. The Circumpolar Current receives silicate from various Sources but especially from the North Atlantic Deep Water introduced in the Atlantic sector. The silicate is largely trapped in the Ring, some in the water, and some in the sediment, and is made available to shallower waters by unusually deep mixing. From these shallower depths silica-rich waters can enter the thermocline all through the southern hemisphere, stimulating diatom growth in upwelling systems to the equator and beyond. From the link diatoms-krill-whales and diatoms-krill-small fishes, it is readily apparent that the link between the climate narrative and the narrative of whale evolution (both for mysticetes and odontocetes) is the silica cycle. Studying it will generate hypotheses about whale evolution that can be tested using fossils. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Staniland, IJ; Taylor, RI; Boyd, IL				Staniland, IJ; Taylor, RI; Boyd, IL			An enema method for obtaining fecal material from known individual seals on land	MARINE MAMMAL SCIENCE												Female Antarctic fur seals returning ashore after foraging trips were restrained, and fecal material was obtained by introducing approximately one litre of warm water into the animal's colon via the anus. The material then naturally expelled by the animal was collected and analyzed. Of 159 enemas attempted, 148 (93%) produced enough fecal material for subsequent analysis, i.e., where ten or more carapaces or one or more otoliths were recovered. The method produced no obvious external signs of damage to any of the animals, and all were observed suckling their pups within the same season. There was no significant difference in the mean krill sizes collected by enema compared to scat sampling. Also, using their incidence, there was no significant difference in the two sampling methods for any of the fish species considered, though using the proportion of otoliths of a given species of the total otoliths found, there was a difference with one species, Gymnoscopelus nicholsi. With this technique, it is possible to target individual seals or specific demographic categories for diet analysis. This means that, by using feces collected from enemas, a wider range of questions can be addressed than are currently possible using scat collection alone.

It was found that the diatom Thalassiosira is preferred by E. superba as a food item and small pennate diatoms, Nitzschia. and Navicula are only tolerated as food. Other algae taxa, such as Tropidoneis, Dactyliosolen, Chaetoceros, and Gyrodinium, are clearly avoided. With respect to phytoplankton cell size, E. superba prefers cells with a length of 20-40 mu m and cells larger than 70 mu m are rejected, Trophic conditions only slightly affect the food selection of E. superba.																	0722-4060					APR	1997	17	4					350	357		10.1007/PL00013376							WOS:A1997WN68000007

Therefore, they can compete with krill for primary production. Over the last three decades, significant variability in S. thompsoni occurrence has been observed as a response to the environmental fluctuations of the Southern Ocean ecosystem (e.g. changes in sea surface temperature and ice-cover shrinkage around the cold Antarctic waters). This study presents historical abundance data of salps from the south-west Atlantic Sector of the Southern Ocean, covering a time span of 26 years. These data allow tracking of fluctuations in Antarctic salp abundance and their distribution with bottom depth, temperature, and ice conditions, aiming to reveal salp hot spots and to predict the future range of S. thompsoni distribution with upcoming climate warming in the next 50 years. Results showed the highest salp density in shallow shelf waters with ice cover and low temperatures between 1 and -1 degrees C. In the studied area, S. thompsoni hot spots were located mostly around Elephant Island, but also the islands around Brensfield and Gerlache Straits, as well as to the south near the Bellingshausen Sea. Inferences made of future salp distribution suggest that the range of S. thompsoni will move southwards, enlarging their habitat area by nearly 500,000 km(2), which may have significant implications on the whole Antarctic food web. The information presented herein may be used for Antarctic ecosystem management, protection, and conservation.

This study investigates environmental factors determining abundance and distribution of blue whales (Balaenoptera musculus), humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) and their prey (Euphausia pacificaandThysanoessa spinifera) in central California. We provide insights into environmental drivers of the ecology and distribution of these species, model whale distributions and determine coincident hotspots of whales and their prey that will help decrease human threats to whales and protect critical feeding habitat. We developed separate predictive models of whale abundances (using negative binomial regression on count data) and krill abundance (using a two-part hurdlemodel combining logistic and negative binomial regressions) over a 14 year period (2004-2017). Variables includedin situsurface and midwater oceanographic measures (temperature, salinity, and fluorescence), basin-scale climate indices, and bathymetric- and distance-related data. Predictions were applied to 1 km(2)cells spanning the study area for May, June, July, and September during each of the 14 years of surveys to identify persistent distribution patterns. Both whales and krill were found to consistently use the northeast region of Cordell Bank, the Farallon Escarpment, and the shelf-break waters. The main identified blue whale hotspots were also krill hotspots, while co-occurrence was more limited and varied seasonally for humpback whales and krill. These results are valuable in identifying patterns in important areas of ecological interaction to assist management of whales. Areas north of Cordell Bank are of particular management concern since they overlap with the end of the San Francisco Bay northern shipping lane. Our findings can help decrease threats to whales, particularly in important foraging areas, by supporting implementation of vessel management and informing potential conflicts with other human uses.

The infestation prevalence of E. planet and the number of individuals attached increased from postmolt stage to premolt stage of E. pacifica, and concurrently cell growth of E. plana was observed. Budding individuals of E. plana first appeared at early premolt stage and increased to 21% at late premolt stage. Thus the life cycle of E. piano seems to be adapted to the molt cycle of E. pacifica.

In this study we examined the utility of head movement as a proxy of prey encounter rates in medium-sized Antarctic penguins, under the presumption that the birds should move their heads actively when they encounter and peck prey. A field study of free-ranging chinstrap and gentoo penguins was conducted at King George Island, Antarctica. Head movement was recorded using small accelerometers attached to the head, with simultaneous monitoring for prey encounter or body angle. The main prey was Antarctic krill (>99% in wet mass) for both species. Penguin head movement coincided with a slow change in body angle during dives. Active head movements were extracted using a high-pass filter (5 Hz acceleration signals) and the remaining acceleration peaks (higher than a threshold acceleration of 1.0. g) were counted. The timing of head movements coincided well with images of prey taken from the back-mounted cameras: head movement was recorded within +/- 2.5.s of a prey image on 89.1 +/- 16.1% (N=7 trips) of images. The number of head movements varied largely among dive bouts, suggesting large temporal variations in prey encounter rates. Our results show that head movement is an effective proxy of prey encounter, and we suggest that the method will be widely applicable for a variety of predators.																	0022-0949	1477-9145				NOV	2011	214	22					3760	3767		10.1242/jeb.058263							WOS:000296581500011	22031740

J	Staniland, IJ; Pond, D				Staniland, IJ; Pond, D			Variability in milk fatty acids: recreating a foraging trip to test dietary predictions in Antarctic fur seals	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY												Using Antarctic fur seals (Arctocephalus gazella (Peters, 1875)) in a feeding trial, we investigated the use of milk fatty acids to determine diet. In a regime designed to replicate an average foraging trip, six female seals were fed on four successive days meals of krill (Euphausia superba Dana, 1850; day 1), mixed krill and icefish (Champsocephalus gunnari Lonnberg, 1905; day 2), and icefish (days 3 and 4). Four milk samples were collected from each female, one every 12 h from the time of the last feed. Fatty acid profiles of samples were analysed using canonical discriminant analysis and classification trees. Milk fatty acids could be used to distinguish between seals fed the experimental diet, which was high in fish, and those feeding naturally, thought to be consuming mostly krill. However, there was significant variation between individual seals, which may have been the influence of feeding prior to the experiment. Milk fatty acids remained relatively unchanged over time, suggesting that the influence of dietary fatty acids was averaged over the suckling period. We conclude that, whilst this technique has potential in studying the diet of higher predators, further work is needed to test the underlying assumptions and mechanisms involved in the transfer of fatty acids from the diet into milk.

J	Suzuki, H; Sasaki, H; Fukuchi, M				Suzuki, H; Sasaki, H; Fukuchi, M			Loss processes of sinking fecal pellets of zooplankton in the mesopelagic layers of the antarctic marginal ice zone	JOURNAL OF OCEANOGRAPHY												A time-series sediment trap deployment was carried out in the marginal ice zone (MIZ) of the Antarctic Ocean (64degrees42' S, 139-58' E; sea depth of 2930 m), during the austral summer. Cylindrical fecal pellets were the predominant sinking particles at 537 in in the middle of January and most of them disappeared below that depth, the loss of which were 25.3 mg C m(-2) day(-1) in the depth range of 537-796 m. Small-sized sinking particles other than fecal pellets increased in that depth range. Analyses of fecal pellets for remnant DNA corresponding to 16S mitochondrial RNA and 28S ribosomal RNA suggested that the large cylindrical fecal pellets at 537 in were produced by Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) and copepods. According to the presence of the DNA associated with sinking particles, E. superba fecal pellets rapidly disappeared below 537 in, while copepod fecal pellets still remained in the mesopelagic and bathypelagic layers. Small-sized amorphous sinking particles at 537 in also contained E. superba- and copepod-derived DNA. The abundance of trap-collected copepods (Oithona spp. and Oncaea spp.) which are known to be coprophagous increased at 796 in where many fecal pellets disappeared. We suggest that those rapidly sinking pellets were fragmented by copepods with intensified coprorhexy activity (fragmentation of fecal pellets) in the mesopelagic layers, reducing their sinking rates. These smaller and slower sinking particles can be important food sources for detritivorus or coprophagous animals in mesopelagic and bathypelagic layers in the MIZ.																	0916-8370					DEC	2003	59	6					809	818		10.1023/B:JOCE.0000009572.08048.0d							WOS:000186403900005						
J	Staniland, IJ; Boyd, IL				Staniland, IJ; Boyd, IL			Variation in the foraging location of Antarctic fur seals (Arctocephalus gazella) and the effects on diving behavior	MARINE MAMMAL SCIENCE												This study investigated how female Antarctic fur seals adapt their foraging behavior, over time scales of days, to spatial unpredictability in the distribution of their food. Lactating Antarctic fur seals are central-place foragers that feed on highly patchy but spatially and temporally dynamic food. We measured the foraging distribution of 28 fur seals to test whether variation in foraging trip durations was reflected in variation in the location of foraging and the diving behavior of seals at sea. Based on the maximum distance travelled from the breeding beach, three categories of foraging trips were defined: those to the continental shelf area (n = 12, median = 71 km), to oceanic water (n = 11, median = 164 km), and to farther offshore oceanic waters (n = 5, median = 260 km). Trip duration and mean surface speed were positively correlated with the maximum distance travelled from the breeding beach. Seals on longer trips spent proportionally less of their time submerged, but there was no significant difference in the total number of dives or the total time spent foraging by seals in relation to trip duration. Evidence from this study and previous work investigating energy gain suggests that an animal on a longer foraging trip could potentially have a higher mean energy return per dive than a similar animal on a shorter foraging trip. Evidence presented suggests that the type of foraging trip (near or far) is not predetermined by the animal but may be a simple response to the stochastic distribution of the resources available.

J	Bates, ML; Hawker, DW; Cropp, R				Bates, Michael L.; Hawker, Darryl W.; Cropp, Roger			Spatio-temporal variations in hexachlorobenzene partitioning in a near shore Antarctic marine environment from a one-dimensional coupled ecosystem-chemical distribution model	JOURNAL OF MARINE SYSTEMS												Hexachlorobenzene (HCB) is an example of a persistent organic pollutant (POP) that is relatively abundant and widespread in near shore Antarctic marine environments. By definition, POPs may distribute with an ecosystem, bioaccumulating and potentially reaching hazardous levels in some organisms. Modelling approaches may provide insight into this behaviour and complement physical sampling that is difficult in such environments. Here, a dynamic, trophically complex ecosystem (biological) model comprising biological groups from plankton to apex predators is coupled to a mass conserving, fugacity based chemical distribution model with vertical resolution of the seawater compartment. The model accommodates seasonal variations in solar irradiance, sea ice coverage, and boundary layer air temperature. The greatest proportion of the HCB is predicted to be in sediment with comparatively little intra-annual variation. For biota, highest lipid based concentrations are in aerial seabirds, baleen whales and seals but considerable seasonal variation is apparent. The POPcline, the water depth where vertical HCB concentration gradient is greatest, is coupled with the base of the mixed layer throughout the Antarctic year. Seasonal partitioning of POPs in Antarctic environments is shown to be subject to oscillating or "flip-flop" dynamics with significantly different controlling factors in summer and winter. In summer, HCB in the surface waters, where most of the biological activity is occurring, is isolated from the sediments that contain most of the POP mass. During winter however, fractional sea ice cover increases turbulent diffusion and the mixed layer and POPcline deepen increasing homogenisation in water column. Surface waters are more likely to come into direct contact with sediments, and biota such as krill migrate to the ocean floor and feed on detritus produced from summer plankton blooms that has since sunk to the ocean floor.

Feeding rates and under-ice foraging strategies of the smallest lunge filter feeder, the Antarctic minke whale (Balaenoptera bonaerensis)	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY												Body size and feeding mode are two fundamental characteristics that determine foraging performance and ecological niche. As the smallest obligate lunge filter feeders, minke whales represent an ideal system for studying the physical and energetic limits of filter feeding in endotherms. We used multi-sensor suction cup tags to quantify the feeding performance of Antarctic minke whales. Foraging dives around and beneath sea ice contained up to 24 lunges per dive, the highest feeding rates for any lunge-feeding whale. Their small size allows minke whales access to krill in sea-ice environments not easily accessible to larger baleen whales. Furthermore, their ability to filter feed provides an advantage over other smaller sympatric krill predators such as penguins and seals that feed on individual prey. The unique combination of body size, feeding mechanism and sea-ice habitat of Antarctic minke whales defines a previously undocumented energetic niche that is unique among aquatic vertebrates.

Using passive acoustics to model blue whale habitat off the Western Antarctic Peninsula	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY												Habitat preferences of calling blue whales were investigated using data from two multidisciplinary oceanographic cruises conducted off the Western Antarctic Peninsula (WAP) during the austral falls of 2001 and 2002. Data were collected on depth, temperature, salinity, chlorophyll a (Chl-a) concentration, krill biomass, zooplankton abundance, and blue whale call presence. In 2001, the study area was sea ice free, high Chl-a concentrations occurred over a small area, krill biomass and zooplankton abundance were high, and few blue whale calls were detected. In 2002 the sea ice covered the southern part of the survey area. Chl-a was high over a large area, krill and zooplankton were low, and there were more blue whale calls. Logistic regression analysis revealed blue whale calls were positively correlated with depth and SST, and negatively correlated with the mean zooplankton abundance from 101 to 300 m and the mean krill biomass in the top 100 m. The negative correlation between blue whale calls and zooplankton could occur if feeding animals do not produce calls. Our survey area did not cover the full range of blue whale habitat off the WAP, as blue whales probably follow the melting and freezing ice edge through this region. Passive acoustics can provide insight to mesoscale habitat use by blue whales in the Southern Ocean where visual sightings are rare, but the ability to localize on the calling animals would greatly improve the ability to model at a finer scale.

J	FEDOTOV, AS				FEDOTOV, AS			EUPHAUSIID LARVAE IN THE EASTERN PART OF THE ANTARCTIC CIRCUMPOLAR CURRENT-WEDDELL SEA CONFLUENCE ZONE IN THE AUSTRAL WINTER	OKEANOLOGIYA												According to data of the complex oceanographical survey in the east Atlantic waters of the South Ocean in June 1982, distribution, abundance and age composition of euphausiid larvae have been described in different modifications of the Antarctic waters. Larvae of Euphausia triacantha and E. frigida were caught only in the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) waters, larvae of E. superba and Thysanoessa macrura encountered both in the ACC and the Weddell Sea waters. Larvae of E. frigida and S. superba were most abundant in gyre structures within the current fields of secondary frontal zone. There were observed a delay in euphausiid spawning season in the ACC waters (E. frigida and E. superba), as well as in the Weddell Sea waters (E. superba). The spawning season of E. superba in the Weddell Sea waters was short, while in the ACC waters it lasted longer. It has been assumed that the oceanic spawning of E. superba which takes place in the eastern part of ACC-Weddell Confluence Zone is important for the reproduction and the recruitment of krill stock in the Atlantic sector of the Antarctic.																	0030-1574					MAR-APR	1992	32	2					285	292									WOS:A1992HT43300014

Particle export from the upper ocean over the continental shelf of the west Antarctic Peninsula: A long-term record, 1992-2007	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY												We report on results of a long-term (1993-2007) time series sediment trap moored at 170 m to the west of the Antarctic Peninsula in the mid-continental shelf region (350 m depth; 64 degrees 30'S, 66 degrees 00'W). This is a region characterized by late spring-summer diatom blooms, moderately high seasonal primary productivity (50-150 mmol C m(-2) d(-1) in December-February), and high phytoplankton and krill biomass in the seasonal sea-ice zone. The mass flux ranged from near 0 to over 1 g m(-2) d(-1) and was near 0% to >30% organic carbon (mean 8%). Sedimentation from the upper ocean as estimated by the trap collections at 170m exhibited strong seasonality with high fluxes (1-10 mmol cm(-2) d(-1)) in November-March following ice retreat and very low fluxes (<0.001 mmol C m(-2) d(-1)) during the Austral winter and under sea-ice cover. An average of 85% of the annual export of 212 mmol C m(-2) occurred during the seasonal peak flux episodes. over the trap record, the annual peak flux episode has tended to occur later in the Austral summer, advancing by about 40 days since 1993. The time-integrated sedimentation during the peak flux episode was < 1-50% of the SeaWiFS-estimated primary production (mean 4%) at the trap site over the period 1998-2006. The elemental composition of material captured in the traps had an average C:N:P of 212:25:1, greater than the canonical Redfield values. High C:P ratios (400-600) corresponded with the annual flux peak, indicating preferential loss of P from the sinking particles in the summer, ice-free period. The composition of the exported material more closely approximated the Redfield composition during the low-flux, winter period. (C) 2008 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Winter and summer biogeography of macrozooplankton community structure in the northern Antarctic Peninsula ecosystem	PROGRESS IN OCEANOGRAPHY												Climate forcing is impacting polar marine ecosystems through increased variability of winter sea-ice dynamics, which likely influences the distribution, abundance and structure of zooplankton assemblages, and thereby trophodynamics of marine food webs. Due to the challenges of working in polar marine ecosystems, most knowledge on polar zooplankton community structure is derived from summer surveys. Here we examine the spatial distribution, abundance and community structure of macrozooplankton in relation to sea-ice and oceanclimate dynamics within the Antarctic Peninsula marine ecosystem over five consecutive winters. We compare the patterns revealed during winter with historical data collected in the same region during austral summer. Hydrographic and macrozooplankton data were collected from >100 standard stations off the northern Antarctic Peninsula during summer (2003-2011) and winter (2012-2016). Using multivariate methods, the environmental drivers and geographic structuring of the macrozooplankton community during winter and summer were investigated. Eight taxa made up 90% of total macrozooplankton abundance in winter including Metridia species, post-larval and larval Euphausia superba, post-larval Thysanoessa macrura, Limacina helicina, Chaetognatha, Ostracoda and Radiozoa. Eight slightly different taxa including Calanoides acutus, Salpa thompsoni, T. macrura (post-larvae and larvae), Metridia spp., E. superba larvae, Chaetognatha, and Rhincalanus spp. made up 87% of the total abundance in summer. Macrozooplankton clustered into five groups in winter and seven groups in summer. Winter macrozooplankton structure was more spatially consistent among years compared to summer regardless of sea-ice conditions. Salinity, chlorophyll a biomass, upper mixed layer depth and time of day were most strongly correlated with the multivariate ordination in winter whereas salinity, phaeopigment biomass and year had the highest correlations for summer, indicating the importance of similar physical features in both seasons. However, the importance of time scales differed among seasons. Although environmental determinants of summer and winter macrozooplankton community structure indicate that community structure and occurrence were strongly tied to regional variability of salinity and primary productivity gradients, macrozooplankton community structure is likely much more complex than only a few hydrographic variables can explain. Cluster boundaries are likely driven by dynamic locations of currents, fronts and localized eddies in any given season or year.																	0079-6611	1873-4472				AUG	2021	196								102610	10.1016/j.pocean.2021.102610							WOS:000677549200001						
J	KOCK, KH; WILHELMS, S; EVERSON, I; GROGER, J				KOCK, KH; WILHELMS, S; EVERSON, I; GROGER, J			VARIATIONS IN THE DIET COMPOSITION AND FEEDING INTENSITY OF MACKEREL ICEFISH CHAMPSOCEPHALUS-GUNNARI AT SOUTH GEORGIA (ANTARCTIC)	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												The diet composition and feeding intensity of mackerel icefish Champsocephalus gunnari around Shag Rocks and the mainland of South Georgia was analyzed from ca 8700 stomachs collected in January/February 1985, January/February 1991 and January 1992. Main prey items were krill Euphausia superba, the amphipod hyperiid Themisto gaudichaudii, mysids (primarily Antarctomysis maxima), and in 1985 also Thysanoessa species. The proportion of krill and T gaudichaudii in the diet varied considerably among the 3 years, whereas the proportion of mysids in the diet remained fairly constant, Krill appears to be the preferred food. In years of krill shortage, such as in 1991, krill was replaced by T gaudichaudii. The occurrence of krill in the diet in 1991 was among the lowest within a 28 yr period of investigation. Variation in food composition among sampling sites was high. This high variation appears to be primarily associated with differences in prey availability, but much less with prey size selectivity. Feeding intensity varied considerably among seasons. It was highest in 1992. The proportion of empty stomachs was uncommonly high and stomach content weight was uncommonly low in January 1991, a period when energy-rich food was needed for the final maturation of gonads. At the same time, an unusually high proportion of sexually mature fish showed no signs of the gonad development necessary for spawning in that season. It was hypothesized that as in some other non-Antarctic fish species the shortage of suitable food may have forced the fish to sacrifice gonad maturation in order to maintain body size.																	0171-8630					MAY	1994	108	1-2					43	57		10.3354/meps108043							WOS:A1994NN70000005						
J	Atkinson, A; Whitehouse, MJ				Atkinson, A; Whitehouse, MJ			Ammonium regeneration by Antarctic mesozooplankton: an allometric approach	MARINE BIOLOGY												Given the importance of copepods in the Southern Ocean food web, there are few assessments of their N budgets or their role in regenerating N. In this study we measured elemental composition and ammonium-excretion rates of copepods and small euphausiids, and estimated the role of metazoans in recycling ammonium in the South Georgia region. Measurements were made during summer on animals ranging over about two orders of magnitude in body mass. A phytoplankton bloom extended throughout the study area, and high C and dry masses of late-stage copepodites suggested good recent feeding conditions. Excretion rates declined roughly exponentially during the similar to1 day incubations in filtered sea water. The patterns observed suggested that the onset of starvation rather than the stress of capture caused this. Allometric relationships between body mass in and excretion rate R were derived using the equation R = am(b). Large compilations of literature data produce a value of b (the body-mass scaling coefficient) of 0.7-0.8. However, in this study, b ranged from 0.57 (for C as the unit of body mass) to 0.71 for N as the unit of body mass. Such low values are also common to previous studies of feeding and excretion among Antarctic copepods. We suggest that this reflects peculiarities of polar environments, namely, lipid storage and diapause in the largest copepods. Previous studies have suggested that ammonium is a preferred N source for algae at South Georgia. Based on the monitoring of a region to the north-east of South Georgia and on zooplankton abundance and excretion rates from this study, we estimate that within the upper mixed layer the copepods and small euphausiids excrete at least one third of the ammonium potentially required by phytoplankton. Krill excretion in this area was measured in a previous study, and it appears that mesozooplankton and krill are together significant regenerators of N in parts of the South Georgia pelagic system.																	0025-3162					AUG	2001	139	2					301	311									WOS:000170744200009

In this study, the Mg3-xCaxAlNO3-HTlcs (x = 0-3, x is the mol.% of Ca) were synthesized and characterized by SEM, XRD, FTIR, BET, ICP-AES and pHzpc analysis. The sorption experiments were conducted in protein systems of bovine serum albumin (BSA) and lysozyme (LSZ). The batch experiment results showed that the NO3-HTlc with Mg/Ca/Al molar ratio of 2.5/0.5/1 had remarkable fluoride sorption ability with maximum sorption capacities of 82.35 mg/g and 72.69 mg/g at pH 5.0 and 40 degrees C in BSA and LSZ system, respectively. Moreover, the loss of BSA of 0.71% was low and there was no loss of LSZ. It was evident that the Mg2.5Ca0.5AlNO3-HTlc could selectively adsorb fluoride from protein solutions. The equilibrium sorption data fitted well to the Langmuir model and the kinetic data conformed to the pseudo-second-order model. Thermodynamic parameters (Delta G degrees, Delta H degrees and Delta S degrees) were evaluated and revealed that the sorption process was spontaneous and endothermic in nature. Furthermore, the results from Antarctic krill processing wastewater study confirmed the feasibility and practicality of the Mg2.5Ca0.5AlNO3-HTlc for fluoride removal in fluoride bearing protein system.

The aim of this study was to further our understanding of the distribution and phylogeny of krill species that were collected in the Ross Sea during the XIX PNRA expedition. Krill from 33 net samples were examined by sequencing parts of two mitochondrial genes; 530 bp of the gene 16S from a total of 20 specimens and 983 bp of NADH from 200 specimens. BIO-ENV analysis showed that the distribution of these species correlated best with water temperature than bottom depth and the ice presence. AMOVA analysis, conducted using the NADH data among geographic populations, revealed no significant differences of nucleotide diversity within the two Euphausia species: E. superba (n = 100, h = 0.97533 +/- 0.0472, p(i) = 0.53433 +/- 0.17212), E. crystallorophias (n = 100, h = 0.81762 +/- 0.07431, p(i) = 0.48578 +/- 0.46825).

Here we describe a class of algal communities that occur on the submerged flanks of large, free-drifting, glacially-derived tabular icebergs. We used remotely operated vehicles to examine these icebergs directly for the first time, to survey the algal communities and collect material for shipboard laboratory studies. The communities, principally diatoms, were associated with a characteristic cupped configuration of the ice surface, and they served as feeding sites for aggregations of Antarctic krill. Production rate measurements indicate that these communities are providing a substantial contribution to regional primary production in summer. As the number of icebergs grows, the number of algae communities may also be increasing, along with their cumulative contribution to organic carbon flux. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

J	NORMAN, FI; WARD, SJ				NORMAN, FI; WARD, SJ			FOODS AND ASPECTS OF GROWTH IN THE ANTARCTIC PETREL AND SOUTHERN FULMAR BREEDING AT HOP ISLAND, RAUER-GROUP, EAST ANTARCTICA	EMU												Foods of adult Antarctic Petrels Thalassoica antarctica and Southern Fulmars Fulmarus glacialoides breeding on Hop Island, Rauer Group, East Antarctica, were obtained using water-offloading techniques, from late incubation to late post-guard periods. Both species took mainly krill, particularly Euphausia superba, and fish, almost entirely Pleuragramma antarcticum; other crustaceans and cephalopods were infrequent. The increase of E. crystallorophias, particularly in Southern Fulmars, was associated with increased P. antarcticum in the diet of both species. No significant differences in prey sizes were detected but the smaller Antarctic Petrel tended to contain more fish and less krill. Results are compared with previous studies; all show a restricted number of prey species, and a wide range of prey sizes. Variations in proportions of specific groups may reflect sampling methods, but more likely reflect prey abundance or availability. The importance of ice cover is discussed. Inshore feeding by Southern Fulmars, and differing feeding methods, may allow segregation of foraging: assuming similar rates of digestion, the more digested food in Antarctic Petrels suggests a greater foraging range. This is supported by differences in attendance shifts at nests. Growth rates of chicks deprived a meal were compared with those of chicks given supplementary meals, and controls. Deprivation apparently caused no immediate effects; additional meals tended to increase growth of Antarctic Petrel chicks. Small sample sizes confounded interpretation but suggested that Antarctic Petrels, which typically breed further south than Southern Fulmars, are better adapted to local conditions where sympatric with Southern Fulmars. The slightly larger volumes of oil retrieved with Antarctic Petrel food supports this since oil offers a more efficient method of transporting food to growing chicks. For these two fulmarine petrels, segregation of food requirements may be by foraging differences; where sympatric, segregation of peak demands may also result from separation of laying periods.																	0158-4197					DEC	1992	92		4				207	222		10.1071/MU9920207							WOS:A1992KG65300002						
J	Tarling, GA; Jarvis, T; Emsley, SM; Matthews, JBL				Tarling, GA; Jarvis, T; Emsley, SM; Matthews, JBL			Midnight sinking behaviour in Calanus finmarchicus: a response to satiation or krill predation?	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												The vertical migration of Calanus finmarchicus and krill (Meganyctiphanes norvegica and Thysanoessa raschii) was monitored during the summer of 1999 in the Clyde Sea using a combination of acoustic and net sampling methods. A moored 300 kHz acoustic Doppler current profiler (ADCP) identified a sound scattering layer (SSL) that started to ascend to the surface during the last moments of daylight. Net samples showed that the SSL was mostly composed of krill. C. finmarchicus rose to the surface in the late afternoon, causing a small but detectable increase in backscatter that did not vary in time through the summer. The ascent of krill, by contrast, became earlier as day length decreased towards autumn. Net samples showed that the strong downward Doppler velocities following the rise of the SSL was caused by the descent of C. finmarchicus. The fact that this coordinated sinking of C. finmarchicus occurred earlier towards autumn, even though the time of ascent to surface remained constant, implies that the feeding 'window' diminished over the course of the season. Feeding conditions did not become significantly better during this same period, discounting satiation as a likely cause of descent. The close temporal coupling between the arrival of krill and the subsequent descent of C. finmarchicus from the surface suggests that midnight sinking in Calanus is a response to predation.																	0171-8630	1616-1599					2002	240						183	194		10.3354/meps240183							WOS:000178457600017						
J	Cresswell, KA; Wiedenmann, J; Mangel, M				Cresswell, K. A.; Wiedenmann, J.; Mangel, M.			Can macaroni penguins keep up with climate- and fishing-induced changes in krill?	POLAR BIOLOGY												Macaroni penguins have evolved to cope with the highly variable conditions of the Southern Ocean. However, changes in prey supply and patchiness potentially associated with changes in climate and krill fishing activity may be occurring too rapidly for the penguins to adapt. We use a stochastic dynamic programming model to examine how changes in both the mean and patchiness of krill supply may affect the foraging decisions, and therefore breeding success, of female macaroni penguins at South Georgia. We predict that rapid changes in the mean supply of prey will have more of an effect on the condition of the female and chick than changes in prey patchiness, and that changes in foraging behavior compensate for changes in prey up to a threshold point, beyond which breeding success is likely impacted. In particular., we predict that the location of the threshold is affected by whether or not the penguins are adapted to the prey environment in which they are foraging, with the female and chick receiving on average 20% less of their daily energetic requirement if the female is not foraging optimally.

J	Cotte, C; Simard, Y				Cotte, C; Simard, Y			Formation of dense krill patches under tidal forcing at whale feeding hot spots in the St. Lawrence Estuary	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												Hydroacoustics (38 and 120 kHz) was used to estimate the abundance and 3-dimensional distribution of krill and small pelagic fishes at the downstream end of Ile Rouge Bank (St. Lawrence Estuary) over the semidiurnal tidal cycle in July 2002. During the flood, upwelling and strong tidal currents (> 1 m s(-1)) forced the krill to aggregate in a patch against the slope of the bank and the mouth of the South Channel. This rich krill patch was then advected in the Laurentian Channel during the ebb. The mean krill density changed from 4 g m(-3) in the neighbouring scattering layer of the Laurentian Channel to 500 g m(-3) in the shoaling zone where the patch formed. This aggregation is ascribed to the interaction between the semidiurnal tidal currents, the local topography, and the negative phototactism of krill. The krill scattering layer was composed of Thysanoessa raschi and Mega-nyctiphanes norvegica. Its upper limit was at a depth corresponding to a light level of 3.1 x 10(-1) to 1.2 x 10(-3) mu W cm(-2) nm(-1) which varied with the turbidity gradient and chlorophyll a concentration. The upper krill scattering layer at this light level was observed to swim down with a mean speed of 5 cm s(-1) (maximum 13 cm s(-1)). The recurrent and tidally predictable availability of rich krill patches makes this part of Ile Rouge bank a highly attractive area for predators such as small pelagic fishes and whales, the latter of which forage on both types of prey during the flood tide.

Seasonal upwelling brings low pH water to the surface along the Pacific Coast of North America. In Monterey Bay, California Euphausia pacifica, a key species supporting a diverse multi-trophic-level ecosystem, currently experiences broad pCO(2) and pH ranges due to both diel vertical migrations and seasonal upwelling. We determined tolerances of E. pacifica to prolonged exposure to pH levels predicted for 2100 by maintaining adults at two pCO(2) levels (380 and 1200 mu atm) for 2 months. Rates of survival and moulting were the same at both pCO(2) levels. High pCO2 slowed growth in all size classes. In additional experiments to determine pCO2 threshold levels above which E. pacifica is adversely affected, survival was not affected down to pH 6.96 (6050 mu atm), but declined rapidly at pH 6.92 (7228 mu atm) and lower, with 100% mortality within 10 d at pH 6.89.																	1054-3139	1095-9289				MAY-JUN	2017	74	4					1005	1012		10.1093/icesjms/fsw021							WOS:000404450100012

Competition among penguins and cetaceans reveals trophic cascades in the western Ross Sea, Antarctica	ECOLOGY												An apparent trophic cascade that appears during summer in the western Ross Sea, Antarctica, explains why the Antarctic silverfish (Pleuragramma antarcticum) there becomes cannibalistic; its principal prey, crystal krill ( Euphausia crystallorophias) becomes scarce; and the diatom community is minimally grazed compared to adjacent areas. The krill is the major grazer of diatoms. On the basis of fieldwork at Ross Island, we suggest that the cascade results from foraging by unusually numerous Adelie Penguins (Pygoscelis adeliae), minke whales (Balaenoptera bonaerensis), and fish-eating killer whales (Orcinus orca). These species and other top predators apparently deplete the krill and silverfish. In drawing our conclusions, we were aided by two "natural experiments.'' In one "experiment,'' large, grounded icebergs altered the seasonal pattern of change in regional sea-ice cover, but not the seasonal change in penguin diet and foraging behavior that was also detected during the pre-iceberg era. In the other "experiment,'' a short-term polynya ( opening in the ice) brought penguins and whales together in a confined area, this time altering both penguin diet and foraging behavior. We conclude that the foraging of penguins and whales, and not a formerly hypothesized seasonal decrease in sea-ice cover, explains (1) the annual switch in the penguins' prey from krill to silverfish, (2) the subsequent lengthening of penguin foraging trips, and (3) a marked decline of cetaceans in the area later in the season. Reduction in the middle-trophic-level prey is expressed in the relaxed grazing pressure on phytoplankton.																	0012-9658					AUG	2006	87	8					2080	2093		10.1890/0012-9658(2006)87[2080:CAPACR]2.0.CO;2							WOS:000239833400025	16937647

A small unmanned aerial system for estimating abundance and size of Antarctic predators	POLAR BIOLOGY												Quantifying the distribution and abundance of predators is integral to many ecological studies, but can be difficult in remote settings such as Antarctica. Recent advances in the development of unmanned aerial systems (UAS), particularly vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) aircraft, have provided a new tool for studying the distribution and abundance of predator populations. We detail our experience and testing in selecting a VTOL platform for use in remote, windy, perennially overcast settings, where acquiring cloud-free high-resolution satellite images is often impractical. We present results from the first use of VTOLs for estimating abundance, colony area, and density of krill-dependent predators in Antarctica, based upon 65 missions flown in 2010/2011 (n = 28) and 2012/2013 (n = 37). We address concerns over UAS sound affecting wildlife by comparing VTOL-generated noise to ambient and penguin-generated sound. We also report on the utility of VTOLs for missions other than abundance and distribution, namely to estimate size of individual leopard seals. Several characteristics of small, battery-powered VTOLs make them particularly useful in wildlife applications: (1) portability, (2) stability in flight, (3) limited launch area requirements, (4) safety, and (5) limited sound when compared to fixed-wing and internal combustion engine aircraft. We conclude that of the numerous UAS available, electric VTOLs are among the most promising for ecological applications.				, Jefferson/AAG-1702-2021	, Jefferson/0000-0002-3600-1414; Krause, Douglas/0000-0002-2517-3106												0722-4060	1432-2056				MAY	2015	38	5					619	630		10.1007/s00300-014-1625-4							WOS:000370838600003

Large-scale oceanographic fluctuations drive Antarctic petrel survival and reproduction	ECOGRAPHY												Polar Regions are experiencing environmental changes at unprecedented rates. These changes can spread throughout entire food webs from lower trophic levels to apex predators. As many top predators forage over large areas, these indirect effects may be associated with large-scale patterns of climate variability. Using global climate indices that are known to impact the Southern Ocean ecosystem (the El Nino Southern Oscillation and Antarctic Oscillation Indices) we assessed their efficacy to predict variation in the demographic parameters of Antarctic seabirds. First, we used a long-term dataset on adult survival (estimated from capture-mark-recapture data) and reproduction of Antarctic petrel Thalassoica antarctica, from the largest known breeding colony (Svarthamaren, Dronning Maud Land) and examined whether large-scale oceanographic fluctuations impact survival and reproduction. Second, we conducted an exhaustive literature review to determine whether the effects of large-scale environmental variability on Antarctic seabirds have a coherent fingerprint across the Antarctic continent and nearby islands. We found that most of the variation in both reproductive success, timing of hatching, and survival of Antarctic petrels can be accurately modeled using the two modes of large-scale climate variability in Antarctica. The literature review, combined with the results from our field study, suggests that while the anticipated trends in the global patterns of climatic variability will generally have detrimental effects on populations of top predators in the Southwest Atlantic, these conclusions cannot be extrapolated to all seabird populations in Antarctica without additional data.

Swarm signals occurring on the echorecords were mainly found in the upper 100 m of the watercolumn, in size varying vertically from 1 to 70 m, and horizontally from less than 5 to over 3,000 m. Catches with a RMT 1 + 8 indicated that the observed swarm signals were most probably caused by krill, Euphausia superba. From late November to early January the swarms migrated northwards away from the ice-edge and towards greater depths, while simultaneously growing in size. The average number of swarms observed per 10 nautical miles along the transects remained fairly constant throughout the cruise, but the average swarm-size and total aggregation size increased during the period studied. The echo-data give evidence of the spring-summer migration of major parts of the krill stock from under the ice-cover towards open waters.																	0722-4060					SEP	1992	12	2					261	268									WOS:A1992JN35500014

Krill powder increases liver lipid catabolism and reduces glucose mobilization in tumor necrosis factor-alpha transgenic mice fed a high-fat diet	METABOLISM-CLINICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL												A promising approach to ameliorate obesity and obesity-associated diseases is the identification of new sources of dietary ingredients. The present study investigated the hepatic regulation of energy metabolism after feeding a powder isolated from Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) in a transgenic mouse model of chronic inflammation (human tumor necrosis factor-alpha (hTNF alpha) mice) known to display unfavorable effects on lipid metabolism. Male hTNF alpha mice were fed high-fat diets (23.6%, w/w) with or without krill powder (6.4% lipids, 4.3% protein, w/w) for 6 weeks. Blood, liver lipid, and fatty acid composition, as well as hepatic enzyme activities and gene expressions, were determined. Krill powder fed mice displayed lowered hepatic and plasma triacylglycerol levels compared to mice on a high-fat casein diet. This was accompanied by down-regulated hepatic expression of genes involved in lipogenesis and glycerolipid synthesis, and increased beta-oxidation activity. In addition, the krill powder diet lowered plasma levels of cholesterol, as well as hepatic gene expression of sterol regulatory element binding transcription factor 2 (SREBP2) and enzymes involved in cholesterol synthesis. Notably, genes involved in glycolysis and gluconeogenesis were significantly reduced in liver by the krill powder diet, while genes involved in oxidative phosphorylation and uncoupling were not affected. Krill powder also reduced endogenous TNF alpha in liver, indicating an anti-inflammatory effect. In a high-fat mouse model with disturbed lipid metabolism due to persistent hTNF alpha expression, krill powder showed significant effects on hepatic glucose- and lipid metabolism, resulting in an improved lipid status in liver and plasma.

To gain insight into the structural and folding mechanisms of AK from Euphausia superba (ESAK), we purified ESAK from muscle properly. The enzyme behaved as a monomeric protein with a molecular mass of about 40 kDa and had pH and temperature optima of 8.0 and 30 degrees C, respectively. The K-m(Arg) and K-m(ATP) for the synthesis of phosphoarginine were 0.30 and 0.47 mM, respectively, and k(cat)/K-m(Arg) was 282.7 s(-1)/mM. A study of the inhibition kinetics of structural unfolding in the denaturant sodium dodecyl sulfate (SOS) was conducted. The results showed that ESAK was almost completely inactivated by 1.0 mM SDS. The kinetics analyzed via time-interval measurements revealed that the inactivation was a first-order reaction, with the kinetic processes shifting from a monophase to biphase as SDS concentrations increased. Measurements of intrinsic and 1-anilinonaphthalene-8-sulfonate-binding fluorescence showed that SDS concentrations lower than 5 mM did not induce conspicuous changes in tertiary structures, while higher concentrations of SDS exposed hydrophobic surfaces and induced conformational changes. These results confirmed that the active region of AK is more flexible than the overall enzyme molecule.(C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

ANTARCTIC SCIENCE												Investigations in recent years of the ecological structure and processes of the Southern Ocean have almost exclusively taken a bottom-up, forcing-by-physical-processes approach relating various species' population trends to climate change. Just 20 years ago, however, researchers focused on a broader set of hypotheses, in part formed around a paradigm positing interspecific interactions as central to structuring the ecosystem (forcing by biotic processes, top-down), and particularly on a "krill surplus" caused by the removal from the system of more than a million baleen whales. Since then, this latter idea has disappeared from favour with little debate. Moreover, it recently has been shown that concurrent with whaling there was a massive depletion of finfish in the Southern Ocean, a finding also ignored in deference to climate-related explanations of ecosystem change. We present two examples from the literature, one involving gelatinous organisms and the other involving penguins, in which climate has been used to explain species' population trends but which could better be explained by including species interactions in the modelling. We conclude by questioning the almost complete shift in paradigms that has occurred and discuss whether it is leading Southern Ocean marine ecological science in an instructive direction.

The still images from the camera loggers showed that the penguins encountered the swarms of krill for 25.5% (range: 8-38%) of their dives (> 5 m) on average, during their foraging trips (mean duration of 5.4 h, n = 7 trips). They encountered krill swarms during the dives to 10-70 m depth, in pelagic as well as benthic habitats. In the benthic habitat, the penguins swam just above the sea floor and headed downward over a krill swarm, probably using the sea floor to assist them to feed on mobile swarms. The shallow coastal waters would be the important foraging habitat of gentoo penguins breeding in King George Island.																	0722-4060	1432-2056				SEP	2008	31	10					1291	1294		10.1007/s00300-008-0502-4							WOS:000258635600015

In addition, the progress of krill development from egg to furcilia was studied from March to August 2010 in a fjord branching off the Godthabsfjord. Krill spawned from late April until early May, with a second spawning event in early July. Spawning took place in the warmer, innermost part of the fjord, correlated with phytoplankton blooms. Naupliar abundance peaked immediately after spawning, and naupliar stage duration was 3 d. Sequences of the calyptopis and furcilia stages lasted 22 and 63 d, respectively. The growth rate from metanauplius to calyptopis was 0.12 d(-1), while the growth rate across all developmental stages was 0.05 d(-1). Mortality rates were calculated as 25% from eggs to nauplii, 48% from eggs to calyptopes and 83% from eggs to furcilia. During development, the larvae were dispersed from the shallow, warmer hatching area in the inner part of the fjord to the main fjord by tidal currents and runoff from land. The study showed that developmental stages of krill are a key group in Greenland coastal waters, one which should be considered in future studies of the pelagic food web.

Historically, a large component of Southern Ocean ecosystem research has focused on Antarctic krill, which provide a short, highly efficient food chain, linking primary producers to higher trophic levels. Over the last 15 years, the presence of alternative energy pathways has been identified and hypotheses on their relative importance in different regions raised. Using the largest circumpolar dietary database ever compiled, we tested these hypotheses using an empirical circumpolar comparison of food webs across the four major regions/sectors of the Southern Ocean (defined as south of 40 degrees S) within the austral summer period. We used network analyses and generalizations of taxonomic food web structure to confirm that while Antarctic krill are dominant as the mid-trophic level for the Atlantic and East Pacific food webs (including the Scotia Arc and Western Antarctic Peninsula), mesopelagic fish and other krill species are dominant contributors to predator diets in the Indian and West Pacific regions (East Antarctica and the Ross Sea). We also highlight how tracking data and habitat modeling for mobile top predators in the Southern Ocean show that these species integrate food webs over large regional scales. Our study provides a quantitative assessment, based on field observations, of the degree of regional differentiation in Southern Ocean food webs and the relative importance of alternative energy pathways between regions.

Individual-based modeling explains the contrasted seasonality in size, growth, and reproduction of the sympatric Arctic (Thysanoessa raschii) and Nordic krill (Meganyctiphanes norvegica) in the St. Lawrence Estuary, eastern Canada	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												The Nordic krill Meganyctiphanes norvegica and Arctic krill Thysanoessa raschii both dominate the krill community within the Estuary and Gulf of St. Lawrence system where they are central forage species for its pelagic ecosystem. We developed a species-specific physiological individual based model that implements the critical physiological processes of growth, molting, and reproduction of female adults as responses to environmental forcing. Key innovations of our approach were the decoupling between the molting schedule and growth, as well as considering two distinct sources of prey (phytoplankton and mesozooplankton). Our simulation results revealed that the details of the feeding process were critical for an accurate representation of the production dynamics of adult individuals from both species. Their specific feeding preferences on phytoplankton and mesozooplankton resulted in distinct species-specific phenological patterns that reproduced observations. The present study highlights the importance of detailed knowledge of diet and feeding behavior of krill species to improve our understanding of population responses in a rapidly changing environment.

Monounsaturated C-21 n-alkenes and highly branched polyunsaturated C-25 n-alkenes were analysed in the aliphatic fraction of the lipids of Antarctic pelagic and inshore marine organisms. Cluster analysis of the species-based data set produced four main groups: phytoplankton, epipelagic herbivores, epipelagic carnivores and mesopelagic omnivores. The detailed pattern of alkenes exhibited differences within the groups and also with tissue type (krill, Euphausia superba). The origin of alkenes in Antarctic biota appeared to be either synthesis de novo or due to the condensation of smaller molecules. Formation of alkenes by the decarboxylation of fatty acids was not consistent with the hydrocarbon and fatty acid composition of Antarctic zooplankton. There was no evidence for direct assimilation of C-21 and C-25 alkenes by zooplankton or higher predators from their diet. Zooplankton C-25 alkenes are probably transported unaltered directly to the sediment as detritus or via predators in faecal material. Sedimentary C-25 alkenes are proposed as biomarkers of recent zooplankton activity in the water column.																	0722-4060					APR	1995	15	4					253	259									WOS:A1995QV57000003

The oceanography of the South Georgia region is principally that of the Southern Ocean rather than the South Atlantic. A combination of factors, including advection, local bathymetry and high local productivity, leads to relatively large concentrations of krill (Euphausia superba) in the region and this is a food source for large populations of penguins and seals that breed at South Georgia. 2. A history of over-exploitation of the marine resources of the region has led to the development of ecosystem approaches to management. The current system for managing krill harvests includes precautionary features that account for interannual variability in krill populations and the food requirements of natural predators. However, in future, it may be possible to use information from the natural krill predators to set reasonable levels of krill exploitation.

J	Berrow, SD; Croxall, JP				Berrow, SD; Croxall, JP			The diet of white-chinned petrels Procellaria aequinoctialis, Linnaeus 1758, in years of contrasting prey availability at South Georgia	ANTARCTIC SCIENCE												The diet of breeding white-chinned petrels was studied during the summers of 1996 and 1998 at South Georgia. Krill abundance/availability was high throughout 1996 but apparently low at the beginning of the 1998 breeding season. The diet of white-chinned petrels was similar between years and consistent with previous studies. Krill Euphausia superba (41-42% by weight) was the single most important prey item followed by fish (39-29%) and squid(19-25%). Meal mass was consistent(110 g in 1996, 119 g in 1998) between years but a significant decrease (46%) in feeding frequency in 1998 (0.54 meals day(-1) compared to 0.75 meals day(-1) in 1996) resulted in 19% less food delivered to chicks in 1998 than in 1996. Breeding success, however, was consistent between years at 44% and similar to that recorded previously at Bird Island. This is in contrast to black-browed and grey-headed albatrosses, both of which experienced almost total breeding failure in 1998. It is suggested that their varied and versatile feeding methods, together with their greater diving ability, capacity to feed at night and extensive foraging range, help white-chinned petrels minimise the effects of krill shortage.																	0954-1020	1365-2079				SEP	1999	11	3					283	292		10.1017/S0954102099000371							WOS:000086753000003

Using three decades of satellite and field data, we document that ocean biological productivity, inferred from chlorophyll a concentration (Chl a), has significantly changed along the WAP shelf. Summertime surface Chl a (summer integrated Chl a similar to 63% of annually integrated Chl a) declined by 12% along the WAP over the past 30 years, with the largest decreases equatorward of 63 S and with substantial increases in Chl a occurring farther south. The latitudinal variation in Chl a trends reflects shifting patterns of ice cover, cloud formation, and windiness affecting water-column mixing. Regional changes in phytoplankton coincide with observed changes in krill (Euphausia superba) and penguin populations.

Interannual variability in the feeding of ice fish (Notothenioidei, Channichthyidae) in the southern Scotia Arc and the Antarctic Peninsula region (CCAMLR Subareas 48.1 and 48.2)	POLAR BIOLOGY												We have studied the annual variation in food intake of three sub-Antarctic ice fish species (Champsocephalus gunnari, Chaenocephalus aceratus, and Pseudochaenichthys georgianus) and three high-Antarctic ice fish species (Chionodraco rastrospinosus, Cryodraco antarcticus, and Chaenodraco wilsoni). Stomach content analyses were conducted during bottom trawl surveys around the South Shetland Islands in 1998, 2001, 2002, 2003, and 2007, the South Orkney Islands in 1999 and 2009, and off the north-western Antarctic Peninsula in 2002, 2006, and 2006/2007 in order to obtain further insight into the amount of food of Antarctic demersal fish consume during summer. Annual variation in food intake was comparatively low within an area in the krill-feeding species C. gunnari and C. wilsoni. Food intake was much more variable, by a factor of 2 or 3 among years and areas, in larger C. aceratus and C. antarcticus, which rely heavily on fish as their dietary source. Food consumption was intermediate in the two species P. georgianus and C. rastrospinosus, which rely on both krill and fish.																	0722-4060					OCT	2013	36	10					1451	1462		10.1007/s00300-013-1363-z							WOS:000324142700006

In this area, they are important prey for walleye pollock Gadus chalcogrammus and other marine animals. In this study, we examined the possibility of identifying krill and copepods based on diSerences in volume backscattering strength at different frequencies. Acoustic surveys were conducted in and around Funka Bay in March 2012 aboard the T/S Ushio-maru using a Simrad EK60 quantitative echo sounder. The acoustic data were collected at 38, 120 and 200 kHz. Biological samples were collected by a ring net with vertical towing. To identify the krill and copepods, diSerences in volume backscattering strength at three frequencies were examined. Krill and copepods showed stronger response at 120 and 200 kHz than at 38 kHz. The results showed that the diSerences in volume backscattering strength between 120 and 200 kHz (Delta SV200-120 kHz) were -1.5 to 1.3 dB for krill and 2.2-3.7 dB for copepods. Based on these diSerences between frequencies, we were able to identify krill and copepods.

J	Miao, K; Wang, ZY				Miao, Kun; Wang, Ziyang			Neighbor-Induction and Population-Dispersion in Differential Evolution Algorithm	IEEE ACCESS												The differential evolution (DE) optimization algorithm predominantly relies on elite individuals and random difference to direct evolution. Although the strategy is clear and easy to implement, identifying a suitable direction for the DE mutation strongly depends on the direction information provided beforehand. To address this, we present a neighbor-induced mutation operator that simulates the neighbor-induced movement of Antarctic krill to guide the evolution direction in a natural manner. Additionally, center dispersion is proposed to disperse the population and redistribute individual positions to escape search stagnation, inspired by the spreading out of krill around newly discovered food. Comprising the new operator and the center dispersion pattern, this paper proposes a neighbor-induced DE algorithm with dispersion pattern (NDEd). The results of the comparative experiments verify the effectiveness of the neighbor-induced mutation operator and the dispersion pattern. Further, experimental results from 28 test functions of CEC2013 demonstrate that NDEd performs better compared to the other classic DE algorithms.

Spatial patterns in activity of leopard seals Hydrurga leptonyx in relation to sea ice	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												Rapid changes to climate in the western Antarctic Peninsula region over the last 50 yr, which have led to decreases in the extent and duration of sea ice, are likely to have significant impacts upon the Antarctic ecosystem as a whole. Understanding the behaviour of higher trophic level animals occupying these regions is important, as they may be indicators of changes in prey availability and food-web structure. Leopard seals Hydrurga leptonyx are important components of the Antarctic ecosystem, because they are widespread and adapted to consuming prey at a range of trophic levels. They rely on sea ice for breeding, moulting and as a resting platform. Using tracks of 12 leopard seals, we calculated first-passage times (indicative of the intensity of area-restricted behaviour) and quantified relative habitat use, including both foraging and resting areas, using Cox proportional hazard models, in relation to coastline, bathymetry and sea ice. We also correlated monthly home range size with monthly sea-ice extent. We found that when sea-ice extent was low, leopard seals were restricted to coastal habitat, but that this effect was lost when sea-ice extent was greater. This was supported by the finding that leopard seal home range size decreased as the sea-ice extent decreased. Since leopard seals and other animals that consume krill are likely to be increasingly limited by sea-ice cover if the warming trend continues, we suggest that the krill fishery be restricted to offshore areas to avoid conflict with krill predators.

(2) The mean duration of foraging trips was 121 h and 100 h in 1988-89 and 1989-90, respectively, while periods ashore were 55 h and 45 h, respectively in the two years. There was a significant difference between these variables in the two years but there was no significant difference in the percentage of time spent at sea. In both years, there was significant variation between individuals in the foraging-attendance time budget. (3) There was a positive correlation between mean time spent ashore and mean time spent at sea for individual seals. The foraging-attendance patterns of seals changed significantly with time through lactation in one year of the study but not in the other. There was no effect of maternal age or size on foraging-attendance time budget. Duration of foraging trips or the period spent ashore had no effect on pup growth rate. (4) During short foraging trips (1-2 d) seals dived for a greater proportion of the time available for foraging than during longer foraging trips (> 3 d). Seals fed predominantly on krill during both years. Most foraging occurred at night and this was reflected in diel variation in times of arrival and departure of seals from the pupping colony. Based on estimated swimming speed and travel times to and from Bird Island, it was estimated that seals were normally feeding between 60 and 90 km from Bird Island.																	0021-8790					JUN	1991	60	2					577	592		10.2307/5299							WOS:A1991FT29200015

The regularities of the spatial distribution of krill and salp aggregations depending on the abiotic (hydrophysical) properties of the environment are distinguished. The characteristics of the aggregations of the biological objects studied and their variability in the time interval considered are given. The possible mechanisms facilitating the formation and spreading of krill and salp aggregations in the Antarctic waters are discussed. It is shown that the shelves of the South Shetland and South Orkney islands remain perspective regions for fishery in the Atlantic sector of Antarctica.

In contrast, euphausiids are suggested to be little impaired by moulting, enabling a swarming pelagic life. The aim of this study was to quantify moult cycle-related changes in the feeding activity of 2 euphausiids, Meganyctiphanes norvegica and Thysanoessa spp. Late furcilia larvae and early postlarvae were kept individually over 6 to 7 wk and fed with either a high or low concentration of Artemia salina nauplii or particulate fish food. The intermoult period, similar to9 d for M norvegica and similar to8 d for Thysanoessa spp., increased with body weight, but did not differ with food source. Moulting was partially synchronised, with up to 50 % of the individuals moulting within 48 h of each other. Daily feeding rates on A, salina decreased on the day before moulting, but increased during the next few days with highest values on Days 1 to 3 after moulting. The deviation from the mean feeding rate over the whole moult was more pronounced at the higher food concentration, reaching up to 40 %. Likewise, the defecation volume was reduced on the moulting day and the following day to similar to50 % of the mean, but increased to 180 % of the mean on Day 3 after moulting. Thus, the moult cycle induces significant changes in feeding rates of larval euphausiids with a similar succession of events and intensity as observed in decapods. Feeding rates, extrapolated from spot measurements on a few individuals, are unlikely to represent average values over the whole moult cycle, especially when populations moult synchronously. We propose a protocol to increase the precision of field estimates on feeding rates.																	0171-8630	1616-1599					2004	281						131	143		10.3354/meps281131							WOS:000225543400011

Diet of Ad,lie penguins (Pygoscelis adeliae) at Stranger Point (25 de Mayo/King George Island, Antarctica) over a 13-year period (2003-2015)	POLAR BIOLOGY												Knowledge of the feeding ecology of a species at local level is fundamental to determine the relationship between the fluctuations in local marine resources and population dynamics of predators. In this study, we examined the diet of Ad,lie penguins (Pygoscelis adeliae) during the crSche stage at the Stranger Point colony, South Shetland Islands, Antarctica, over a 13-year period (2002/2003-2014/2015). Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) was the dominant prey for Ad,lie penguins during the crSche period (contribution: 100% of occurrence and > 99.7% by mass). The fish component in the diet represented a small proportion of the total prey (contribution: from 4 to 24% of occurrence but < 0.15% by mass). A marked inter-annual variability in the mass of stomach contents, the krill size consumed and the proportion of juvenile krill was observed. Moreover, a possible recruitment event of krill was recorded. A negative relationship between the size of krill in the diet and breeding success was found, suggesting that population dynamics of krill also reflected changes in the local availability of this crustacean. This work is the first long-term study of dietary parameters of Ad,lie penguins for the Stranger Point colony.

They remained below prevailing fish schools, though varying numbers of deep-living fish occurred among the krill. The estimated light intensity at the top of the krill layer varied between 4.6 x 10(-6) and 2.3 x 10(-4) mu mol m(-2) s(-1). M, norvegica followed isolumes during ascent at dusk, but upward migration was mainly arrested at similar to 10-30 m and the krill were scattered throughout the water column at night. The minimum depth was not related to seasonal light levels, chlorophyll concentration or the pycnocline. Fish schools dispersed at sunset, and fish invaded the krill layer at night. Nocturnal avoidance of the surface water may thus have been an antipredator response. Herbivorous feeding was strongly related to abundance of algae (chl a levels). Feeding on phytoplankton increased at night, but daytime stomach pigment content was high during spring, when sedimenting phytoplankton appeared to represent a deep food source. Feeding on copepods was evident both day and night, with no consistent relation between copepod remains in the stomachs and integrated abundance of copepods in the water column. M. norvegica carried out diel vertical migrations irrespective of fluctuations in distribution and abundance of food resources.																	0171-8630						1998	171						209	219		10.3354/meps171209							WOS:000076561600018

Concentrations of dissolved iron (DFe) and total acid-leachable iron (TaLFe) were measured in the upper 150 m at 16 of these stations (both coastal and pelagic waters) to better resolve the factors limiting primary production in this area and in downstream waters of the Scotia Sea. The concentrations of DFe and TaLFe in the upper mixed layer (UML) were relatively high in Weddell Sea Shelf Waters (similar to 0.6 nM and 15 nM, respectively) and low in Drake Passage waters (similar to 0.2 nM and 0.9 nM, respectively). In the Bransfield Strait, representing a mixture of waters from the Weddell Sea and the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC), concentrations of DFe were similar to 0.4 nM and of TaLFe similar to 1.7 nM. The highest concentrations of DFe and TaLFe in the UML were found at shallow coastal stations close to Livingston Island (similar to 1.6 nM and 100 nM, respectively). The ratio of TaLFe:DFe varied with the distance to land: similar to 45 at the shallow coastal stations, similar to 15 in the high-salinity waters of Bransfield Strait, and similar to 4 in ACC waters. Concentrations of DFe increased slightly with depth in the water column, while that of TaLFe did not show any consistent trend with depth. Our Fe data are discussed in regard to the hydrography and water circulation patterns in the study area, and with the hypothesis that the relatively high rates of primary production in the central regions of the Scotia Sea are partially sustained by natural iron enrichment resulting from a northeasterly flow of iron-rich coastal waters originating in the South Shetland Islands-Antarctic Peninsula region.

Variability in transport pathways on and around the South Georgia shelf, Southern Ocean: Implications for recruitment and retention	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS												The waters around South Georgia are among the most productive in the Southern Ocean, with zooplankton populations close to the island, in particular Antarctic krill, supporting vast colonies of higher predators. However, our understanding of the processes governing variability in the supply of these food resources is limited by the poor spatial and temporal resolution of available data. Here, we use a numerical modeling approach to examine the underlying physical processes driving the recruitment and retention of zooplankton to the South Georgia shelf. Variability in the magnitude and spatial distribution of recruitment was dominated by the proximity and orientation of the southern Antarctic Circumpolar Current front to the shelf edge. Shelf retention was highest for source sites on the southwest shelf, with the main transport routes off the shelf to the north and northwest. Retention was lowest in the austral summer and winter; in summer increased glacial melt drives stronger off-shelf near-surface currents, while in winter, stronger winds lead to an increase in off-shelf transport. Of particular note was the prediction of a significant increase in retention for particles released throughout the shelf in April and July 2000. This period coincided with the development of pronounced anticlockwise shelf flows, associated with horizontal density gradients due to reduced wind mixing of shelf waters, and differences between shelf and oceanic waters, which significantly reduced off-shelf transport rates. Such findings are crucial for understanding the influence of variability in physical processes on the ecosystem at South Georgia.

Molecular clock estimates for divergence times of Antarctic and sub-Antarctic species of Euphausia of similar to 15 million years ago were fairly close to the time of formation of the Antarctic Convergence, consistent with their vicariant speciation. However, the confidence limits quantified for these time estimates were large at similar to 11 million and similar to 25 million years. A divergence time of between similar to 10 million years for Euphausia triacantha and Euphausia longirostris suggested that migration across oceanographic fronts like the Antarctic Convergence may also lead to speciation in krill. Genetic differentiation between Euphausia vallentini and Euphausia lucens was found to be relatively minor and occurred between 0.76 million and 1.65 million years ago. These species have overlapping ranges, suggesting that there is potential for sympatric genetic differentiation in krill.

The results showed that amphipods and krill were the major prey. However, there was a significant difference in the proportions of larger invertebrates such as squids, octopus and other crustaceans found in the fish stomachs between 2009/2010 and the previous years. Moreover, the percentage of amphipods and krill in fish stomachs declined over the 5-year period in all fish size classes. Several factors including sea ice melting, habitat and environmental changes might have influenced the pattern of feeding behavior. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. and NIPR. All rights reserved.

Influence of Delipidation on Hg Analyses in Biological Tissues: A Case Study for an Antarctic Ecosystem	WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION												The use of low-polarity organic solvents is widespread in cleanup/extraction processes in order to carry compounds of interest, remove interferences and separate phases, among other uses. A large number of studies have used delipidation to remove excess of lipids to analyse carbon stable isotopes in biological tissues for trophic and behavioural ecology investigations. In this context, the primary aim of this study is to assess the influence of one delipidation process on the results of total mercury (Hg) analyses and the possible use of delipidated samples from previous analyses, such as for stable isotopes, in Hg level determination. Samples of vegetation (angiosperm, lichens and mosses), invertebrates (krill and limpets), fish (marbled and black rockcod), bird liver and eggs (Antarctic, Gentoo and Adelie penguins, kelp gull, Antarctic tern, cape petrel and giant southern petrel) and pinniped tissues (Weddell seal, crabeater seal, southern elephant seal and Antarctic fur seal) were analysed for Hg before and after delipidation by cyclohexane. The difference between the two measurements ranged individually from -63 to 136% (in the moss Sanionia uncinata) and the averages ranged from -60 to 66% (in pinniped tissues). The proportion of organic Hg, which presents considerable lipophilicity, but also high affinity for sulfhydryl groups in proteins, might be responsible for such variability. Given the limitations of our study, we think it is safe to say that delipidated samples could not be used to infer total Hg values in non-delipidated ones.

Overall, fish were the most frequent prey (74.5%) and predominated by mass (54.4%), whereas krill predominated by number (94.2%). This coincides well with the pattern observed in 1997, but in 1996 krill was the most important prey by number and mass (50.2%). The importance of the remaining taxa represented in the samples (octopods, hyperiids and bivalves) was negligible. Among fish, myctophids represented 85.2% of the fish mass, with Gymnoscopelus nicholsi and Electrona antarctica being the main prey. These two species predominated in 1997, whereas the channichthyid Cryodraco antarcticus and the nototheniid Gobionotothen gibberifrons were dominant in 1996. The importance of the myctophids as prey of the Antarctic fur seal is discussed.																	0722-4060					DEC	1998	20	6					424	428		10.1007/s003000050324							WOS:000077363400009

Environmental conditions strongly influence microalgal photophysiology, biochemistry and macromolecular composition, which has implications for the quality and quantity of energy available for transfer through the food web. Here we assessed the photosynthetic performance, biochemical (dimethylsulfoniopropionate; DMSP) and macromolecular composition (lipids, carbohydrates and proteins) of selected diatoms sampled from 2 distinct Antarctic marine environments, namely the late spring bottom sea ice (sympagic) and near-shore ice-free coastal waters (pelagic). The photosynthetic efficiency and photoprotective capacity of the communities differed significantly, and chlorophyll a-specific gross primary productivity was 4-fold greater in the pelagic community. At the community level, pelagic microalgae had the highest DMSP content (1.4 nmol [mu g chl a](-1)) and the highest potential rates of DMSP lyase activity (0.87 nmol [mu g chl a](-)1 h(-1)). Comparisons within each community showed taxon-specific differences in macromolecular composition, which were strongest amongst the sympagic diatoms. Comparing across communities, pelagic diatoms had lower lipid to protein ratios, whereas sympagic diatoms were lipid rich and had significantly higher content of unsaturated fatty acids. These findings show variability in the physiology and nutritional quality of the base of the food web depending on habitat and taxonomic group and emphasise the importance of the sympagic community for providing a concentrated source of high-energy compounds during the pulsed productivity events for key grazers such as krill to survive through long dark winters.

Overall, krill and fish were the most frequent prey, occurring in an average of 97% and 69% of samples (n=128), followed by cephalopods (12%). Myctophids constituted almost 90% of the fish predated, with Electrona antarctica and Gymnoscopelus nicholsi being the most abundant and frequent species consumed. All fish taxa identified were krill-feeding species suggesting that seals foraged primarily on krill and opportunistically on fish species associated with krill swarms. A seasonal change observed in the relative proportions of the different fish prey taxa indicates that fur seals spent more time foraging over the shelf in summer and off the shelf in autumn. During the study period, commercial fishing in the area was not based upon any of the fish identified in this study.																	0722-4060					MAR	2005	28	4					329	333		10.1007/s00300-004-0693-2							WOS:000227552000011

By electronically tagging 175 penguins in four seasons with contrasting sea-ice conditions, we show that ice-free environments enhance, not deteriorate, foraging efficiencies and breeding success. In an ice-free season, penguins traveled by swimming rather than walking, leading to larger foraging areas, shorter trip durations, and lower energy expenditure than three ice-covered seasons. Freed from the need to find cracks for breathing, dive durations decreased, and more krill were captured per unit dive time, which may also be associated with phytoplankton blooms and increased krill density in the sunlit ice-free water. Consequently, adult body mass, chick growth rates, and breeding success increased. Our findings explain the regional population trends and demonstrate a key link among sea ice, foraging behavior, and reproductive success in this iconic species.

Essential krill species habitat resolved by seasonal upwelling and ocean circulation models within the large marine ecosystem of the California Current System	ECOGRAPHY												Due to their global distribution, high biomass and energy content, euphausiids (krill) are important prey for many mid and upper trophic level marine organisms. Understanding drivers of krill habitat is essential for forecasting range shifts, and to better understand the response of krill predators to climate change. We hypothesized that the distribution and abundance of krill species derived from ecosystem surveys in spring/summer relates to geomorphic features, coastal upwelling during the preceding winter, and spring mesoscale oceanographic conditions. To test this hypothesis, we used boosted regression trees with environmental data and ocean model output to quantify the habitat associations of two primary krill species (Euphausia pacificaandThysanoessa spinifera) in the central California Current Ecosystem from 2002 to 2018. Models confirmed the neritic distribution of T. spiniferaand pelagic, outer slope association of E. pacifica(deviance explained similar to 35%). Distribution of these species were influenced by depth and bottom rugosity; chlorophyll-a concentrations and increased winter upwelling conditions; and spring surface currents and wind stress. Thysanoessa spiniferaand E. pacifica-abundance responded negatively (positively) to warm (cold) climate events, confirming known relationships. As an independent evaluation of krill models, observations of krill predator (seabirds, marine mammals) distribution indicated they were present within habitats of predicted high krill species abundance. Our framework indicates species-specific habitat relationships for these foundational forage species and their negative response to large-scale climate variations, such as El Nino and marine heatwave conditions. The approach can be easily transferred to other ecosystems or krill species that respond to similar ocean and climate forcing.

We demonstrate here, for the first time, that the adjacent ocean showed profound coincident changes, with surface summer temperatures rising more than 1 degrees C and a strong upper-layer salinification. Initially driven by atmospheric warming and reduced rates of sea ice production, these changes constitute positive feedbacks that will contribute significantly to the continued climate change. Marine species in this region have extreme sensitivities to their environment, with population and species removal predicted in response to very small increases in ocean temperature. The WAP region is an important breeding and nursery ground for Antarctic krill, a key species in the Southern Ocean foodweb with a known dependence on the physical environment. The changes observed thus have significant ecological implications.

D.; Plaganyi, Eva E.; Brown, Christopher; Richardson, Anthony J.; Matear, Richard			Future recovery of baleen whales is imperiled by climate change	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY												Historical harvesting pushed many whale species to the brink of extinction. Although most Southern Hemisphere populations are slowly recovering, the influence of future climate change on their recovery remains unknown. We investigate the impacts of two anthropogenic pressures-historical commercial whaling and future climate change-on populations of baleen whales (blue, fin, humpback, Antarctic minke, southern right) and their prey (krill and copepods) in the Southern Ocean. We use a climate-biological coupled "Model of Intermediate Complexity for Ecosystem Assessments" (MICE) that links krill and whale population dynamics with climate change drivers, including changes in ocean temperature, primary productivity and sea ice. Models predict negative future impacts of climate change on krill and all whale species, although the magnitude of impacts on whales differs among populations. Despite initial recovery from historical whaling, models predict concerning declines under climate change, even local extinctions by 2100, for Pacific populations of blue, fin and southern right whales, and Atlantic/Indian fin and humpback whales. Predicted declines were a consequence of reduced prey (copepods/krill) from warming and increasing interspecific competition between whale species. We model whale population recovery under an alternative scenario whereby whales adapt their migratory patterns to accommodate changing sea ice in the Antarctic and a shifting prey base. Plasticity in range size and migration was predicted to improve recovery for ice-associated blue and minke whales. Our study highlights the need for ongoing protection to help depleted whale populations recover, as well as local management to ensure the krill prey base remains viable, but this may have limited success without immediate action to reduce emissions.

J	Weber, K; Goerke, H				Weber, K; Goerke, H			Persistent organic pollutants (POPs) in antarctic fish: levels, patterns, changes	CHEMOSPHERE												Organochlorine compounds were analysed in three fish species of different feeding types from the area of Elephant Island in the Antarctic. In 1996, hexachlorobenzene (HCB) (means: 15-20 ng/g lipid), p,p'-DDE (5-13 ng/g lipid) and mirex (1-7 ng/g lipid) predominated, while PCBs were minor components (PCB 153: 0.4-2 ng/g lipid). Concentration patterns were species-dependent: PCB 180, PCB 153, mirex, nonachlor III, trans-nonachlor and the toxaphene compound B8-1413 were highest in the bottom invertebrate feeder Gobionotothen gibberifrons and lowest in the krill feeder Champsocephalus gunnari. Levels of p,p'-DDE, PCB 138 and heptachloro-1'-methyl-1,2'-bipyrrole (Q1), a natural bioaccumulative product, were highest in the fish feeder Chaenocephalus aceratus, whereas HCB was present in about equal concentrations in all species. Most compounds were taken up preferentially via the benthic food chain, the chlorinated bipyrrole via the pelagic food chain and HCB from the water. In antarctic fish, biomagnification was generally more important than bioconcentration. Between 1987 and 1996, most persistent organic pollutant (POP) levels showed significant increases in the benthos feeder and the fish feeder, while they remained nearly constant or increased less in the krill feeder. Hence, the former species represent indicator species for changing POP levels in Antarctica. Ratios (1996/1987) of average concentrations in G. gibberifrons were: PCB 138 0.7, HCB 0.8, 138-1413 1.5, PCB 180 1.7, PCB 153 1.8, p,p'-DDE 2.0, nonachlor III 2.9, trans-nonachlor 3.3, mirex 6.7. By comparison with trends in the northern hemisphere it is concluded that global distribution of HCB is close to equilibrium. Changing levels of other POPs reflect global redistribution and increasing transfer to antarctic waters probably due to recent usage in the southern hemisphere and climate changes.

Climate change and the Antarctic marine ecosystem: an essay on management implications	ANTARCTIC SCIENCE												In this paper we review evidence for, and anticipated consequences of, climate change in Antarctic marine communities, examining the potential impacts on invertebrates and vertebrates alike and exploring plausible outcomes for species, with examples principally from the Antarctic literature. We suggest that industries with the greatest potential to aggravate climate change impacts on marine communities are marine capture fisheries. In the Southern Ocean, harvesting is governed under the Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR). CCAMLR espouses an ecological management framework and so has the capacity to mitigate harvesting impacts such that they do not worsen impacts from climate change. We discuss some of the implications of climate change and advocate that CCAMLR address certain key issues if it is to fulfil its international obligations. It will be essential for CCAMLR to determine relative risks (uncertainties), impacts and timescales, of various processes consequent on climate change. Such risk assessments should be feasible with current knowledge and should provide a focus for future work. We believe it will be important to prioritize issues that reduce impacts and uncertainties by the greatest degree, and propose that future plans should involve shared responsibility (e.g. with SCAR etc.) for each of the risks described.																	0954-1020	1365-2079				AUG	2010	22	4					387	398		10.1017/S0954102010000222							WOS:000280934100007

Ross seal (Ommatophoca rossii) annual distribution, diving behaviour, breeding and moulting, off Queen Maud Land, Antarctica	POLAR BIOLOGY												Six out of ten adult Ross seals that were tagged with Argos satellite-linked dive recorders off Queen Maud Land, just after the moult in February, provided data on location and diving activity throughout a year. Shortly after tagging, the animals headed 2,000 km north and stayed pelagic in the area south of the Antarctic Polar Front, until October when they went south into the pack-ice. Throughout the year they made about 100 dives a day, most to a depth of 100-300 m, the deepest dive on record being 792 m, while some dives were very shallow during their stay in the pack-ice. Most dives, outside the breeding and moulting period, lasted for 5-15 min throughout the year. This diving behaviour is consistent with feeding on mid-water fish, like Pleurogramma antarcticum, squid, and to some extent krill (Euphausia superba), when in the pack-ice, and myctophid fish and several species of squid, when in the open ocean. The nursing period was 13 days in mid-November, and moulting occurs in late January-early February, which is the period when sightings surveys for this species should be done.																	0722-4060	1432-2056				OCT	2007	30	11					1449	1458		10.1007/s00300-007-0306-y							WOS:000249306800009						
J	Reid, K; Hill, SL; Diniz, TCD; Collins, MA				Reid, K; Hill, SL; Diniz, TCD; Collins, MA			Mackerel icefish Champsocephalus gunnari in the diet of upper trophic level predators at South Georgia: implications for fisheries management	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												The mackerel icefish Champsocephalus gunnari Lonnberg is an important component of the ecosystem at South Georgia. Its diet is dominated by Antarctic krill Euphausia superba; in turn, it is also an important prey of a number of tipper trophic level predators, as well as being the target of commercial fisheries. Data on the frequency and size structure of mackerel icefish in the diet of Antarctic fur seals Arctocephalus gazella and gentoo penguins Pygoscelis papua from 1991 to 2002 were used to examine trophic interactions involving this species and to evaluate the potential impact of predators on its population. Mackerel icefish occurred in 10 to 20 % of scats from Antarctic fur seals and comprised 48 % of the diet by mass of gentoo penguins. The contribution of mackerel icefish to the diet of predators was in inverse proportion to the contribution of Antarctic krill. The length-frequency distributions of mackerel icefish indicated a dominant mode at 130 to 180 mm total length (the 1+ age class), with apparent strong cohorts entering the population in 1993, 1996, 1999 and 2001. Extrapolation of diet data to produce a consumption estimate for the South Georgia population of Antarctic fur seals and gentoo penguins suggests that scientific trawl surveys may underestimate the standing stock of mackerel icefish by I order of magnitude. Changes in the South Georgia ecosystem over the past 2 decades may have increased the level of consumption of mackerel icefish by predators, providing a potential ecosystem-based explanation for the lack of a recovery to the pre-exploitation population size.				, Martin/ABE-6728-2020; Collins, Martin A/J-8560-2017; Simeon, Hill L/B-2307-2008													0171-8630	1616-1599					2005	305						153	161		10.3354/meps305153							WOS:000235079200013

Four sites, at which topographically-induced upwelling of UCDW occurred, were identified in a 50 km by 400 km band along the outer WAP continental shelf. One additional site at which wind-driven upwelling occurred was also identified. Diatom-dominated phytoplankton assemblages were always associated with a topographically-induced upwelling site. Such phytoplankton communities were not detected at any other shelf location, although diatoms were present everywhere in the 80,000 km(2) study area and UCDW covered about one-third the area below 150 m. Phytoplankton communities dominated by taxa other than diatoms were restricted to transition waters between the UCDW and shelf waters, the southerly flowing waters out of the Gerlache Strait, and/or the summertime glacial ice melt surface waters very near shore. We suggest that in the absence of episodic intrusion and upwelling of UCDW, the growth requirements for elevated silicate/nitrate ratios and/or other upwelled constituents (e.g. trace metals) are not sufficiently met for diatoms to achieve high abundance or community dominance. One consequence of this is that the ice-free regions of the outer WAP continental shelf will not experience predictable spring diatom blooms. Rather, this region will experience episodic diatom blooms that occur at variable intervals and during different seasonal conditions, if the physical structuring events are occurring. Preferential drawdown of silicate relative to nitrate was observed at each of the offshore upwelling sites and resulted in a reduction in the ambient silicate:nitrate ratio relative to the corresponding value for unmodified UCDW (1.5 versus 3.0 for UCDW). The magnitude of the nutrient drawdown in areas of topographically-induced upwelling suggested that diatom growth had been elevated in response to recent upwelling but that the resulting increased algal biomass was either dispersed by advective processes and/or consumed by the larger krill that were observed to be associated with each offshore upwelling site. Thus, diatom bloom conditions on the outer WAP shelf may not be recognized based on elevated biomass and/or rates of carbon fixation. It was likely that similar physical forcing of significant phytoplankton growth, especially diatoms, may occur but be undetected in regions where the southern boundary of the ACC nears the Antarctic continental shelf edge. Our analyses from the west Antarctic Peninsula demonstrate coupling of the structure of the physical environment with nutrient distributions and phytoplankton assemblages and through to the higher trophic levels, such as Antarctic krill. This environment-trophic coupling may also occur in other regions of the Antarctic, as suggested by correspondences between the distribution of Southern ACC boundary and regions of high concentrations of Antarctic krill. The many mechanisms underlying this coupling remain to be determined, but it was clear that the ecology and biology of the components of the marine food web of the Antarctic continental shelf cannot be studied in isolation from one another or in isolation from the physical environment.

Feeding habits of three seal species at the Danco Coast, Antarctica: a re-assessment	POLAR BIOLOGY												The analysis of prey overlap among Weddell, Antarctic fur and leopard seals was conducted using fecal samples collected at the Danco Coast, Antarctic Peninsula, in 1998 and 2000. The re-occurrence of prey species was moderate in samples collected in 1998, and low in 2000, and reflects resource partitioning among seal species. Prey species that mostly co-occurred in seals' diet were the Antarctic krill Euphausia superba, bivalves, and the myctophids Gymnoscopelus nicholsi and Electrona antarctica. A dietary similarity index of prey overlap has been calculated and demonstrates evident fluctuations in pairwise comparisons between the seal species. The highest and lowest values of prey overlap were observed between Antarctic fur seals and leopard seals, and between Weddell seals and leopard seals, respectively. Prey overlap between Antarctic fur seals and Weddell seals was moderate in both seasons.																	0722-4060					OCT	2011	34	10					1615	1620		10.1007/s00300-011-0994-1							WOS:000297202300019

Data for Pb-210, the grandparent of Po-210, are less abundant: we therefore report here Pb-210 concentrations in a substantial collection of marine biota obtained from the Antarctic Ocean during the SIBEX II cruise in 1985. The general levels of Pb-210 are within the range of previously published data but, as in the case of Po-210, there are differences which can be associated with variations in the diet of the organism. The levels of Pb-210 in the krill Euphausia superba show seasonal changes which can be interpreted in terms of changing diet. In a simple classification of the pelagic food chain, the levels of Pb-210 tend to increase from omnivores to filter-feeders to predators.																	0025-3162	1432-1793				JAN	1993	115	1					161	171		10.1007/BF00349398							WOS:A1993KH00100020

Variable vital rates and the risk of population declines in Adelie penguins from the Antarctic Peninsula region	ECOSPHERE												Predicting population responses in changing environments is an important task for ecologists. In polar regions, climate warming, loss of sea ice, and more frequent anomalous events suggest that further reductions in ice-dependent animal populations are likely. We assess the risk of near-term (30-year) depletion of an Adelie penguin (Pygoscelis adeliae) population with a stochastic matrix model parameterized with 30 yr (1982-2011) of data from the Copacabana colony on King George Island, Antarctica. The model was fitted to nest census data by estimating correction factors for survival rates estimated from a multi-state mark-recapture model. We modeled future survival and fecundity scenarios during the projection period (2012-2041) based on a two-state Markov chain that randomly assigned survival rates and reproductive success from their respective historical distributions to represent "good" and "poor" years. Monte Carlo simulation was used to estimate population trajectories across a range of progressively worse survival conditions. The results suggest that, given historical distributions of survival and reproductive success, a limited scope for recovery of the population is present, commensurate with recent stabilization in population size at the study site. However, our projections mainly suggest that the Adelie penguin population will decline if the frequency of years with poor survival remains at, or increases above, its 30-year mean. The risk of local depletion within 30 yr, defined according to International Union for Conservation of Nature categories for endangered and critically endangered species, was 33% for > 90% declines, but near 100% for 50% declines given status-quo conditions. As survival conditions worsen, the risk of substantive depletions rose rapidly. Given expectations of further environmental and ecosystem changes in the northern Antarctic Peninsula region, continued declines in Adelie penguin population size at the northern extent of their range should be expected.				, Jefferson/AAG-1702-2021	, Jefferson/0000-0002-3600-1414												2150-8925					JAN	2017	8	1							e01666	10.1002/ecs2.1666							WOS:000396526300030						
J	Ligowski, R				Ligowski, R			Benthic feeding by krill, Euphausia superba Dana, in coastal waters off West Antarctica and in Admiralty Bay, South Shetland Islands	POLAR BIOLOGY												Diatoms in the food of krill caught in the summer in coastal waters close to the South Shetland Islands and in the summer and three winters in Admiralty Bay, King George Island were investigated. The diatoms were used as indicators of sources of krill food. Principal component analysis divided the diatom taxa into two groups, one being pelagic diatoms and from the food of krill in coastal waters, and the other being benthic diatoms and taxa from the food of krill in Admiralty Bay. All pelagic taxa of diatoms were consumed by krill. In the summer in coastal waters, benthic diatoms in krill food originated from the sublittoral. In the summer in Admiralty Bay, besides phytoplankton, diatoms were noted from the sublittoral and littoral in the food of krill. However, in the winter mostly sublittoral and epiphytic diatoms were present in krill food.																	0722-4060					SEP	2000	23	9					619	625		10.1007/s003000000131							WOS:000089208600004

By requiring that the difference between predicted and measured target strengths be a minimum in a least-squares sense, it is possible to infer the orientation distribution.

Five experimental diets consisted of different proportions of FM (0, 25, 50, 75, and 100 g/kg) were substituted with KM, corresponding to dietary inclusion levels of 0 (KM0), 28.8 g/kg (KM29), 57.6 g/kg (KM58), 86.4 g/kg (KM86), and 115.2 g/kg (KM115). The results showed that: (1) the weight gain rate (WGR) of the fish in the KM58, KM86, and KM115 groups were significantly higher than those of the KM0 group, whereas the opposite result was observed for the feed conversion ratio. (2) Serum complement 3 content and superoxide dismutase activity in the KM58 group and alkaline phosphatase activity in the KM29, KM58, and KM115 groups were significantly higher than those in the KM0 group. However, there were no significant differences in serum immunoglobulin M, complement 4, malondialdehyde content, and catalase activity among all groups. (3) The highest levels of hardness, cohesiveness, springiness, chewiness, gumminess, and adhesiveness of muscle tissues of M. albus fed with the KM58 diet were significantly higher than those of the other treatments. (4) No remarkable difference was detected in MEF2A, MEF2D, MyoG, and Myf5 mRNA expression levels in the muscle tissues among the dietary treatments. However, MyoD2, Myh6, MyoD1, MRF4, MEF2B, and MEF2C mRNA expression levels were significantly upregulated by KM replacement.

Male E. superba specimens were generally separated between the cephalothorax and abdomen while the majority of the females were intact. This finding has implications for current methods of analysis that use an "intact carapace" as a criterion for subsample selection. Such a criterion eliminates all individuals without a cephalothorax, which in this study were mostly male. Consequently, this subsampling method may lead to an underestimation of the male component of the sample.																	0722-4060					OCT	2002	25	10					717	720		10.1007/s00300-002-0397-4							WOS:000178842800001

The timing of sea ice formation and exposure to photosynthetically active radiation along the Western Antarctic Peninsula	POLAR BIOLOGY												Understanding the flow of solar energy into ecosystems is fundamental to understanding ecosystem productivity and dynamics. To gain a better understanding of this fundamental process in the Antarctic winter sea ice, we produced a model that estimates the time-integrated exposure of seasonal Antarctic sea ice to PAR through the use of remotely sensed sea ice concentrations, sea ice movement and spatially distributed PAR calculations that account for cloud cover and have applied this model over the past three decades. The resulting spatially distributed estimates of sea ice exposure to PAR by mid-winter are evaluated in context of changes in the timing of sea ice formation that have been documented along the Western Antarctic Peninsula (WAP) region and its potential effects on the variation (seasonal and inter-annual) in the accumulation of sea ice algae in this region. The analysis shows the ice pack is likely to have large inter-annual variations (10-100 fold) in productivity throughout the autumn to winter transition in the sea ice along the WAP. Moreover, the pack ice is likely to have spatial structure in regards to biological processes that cannot be determined from analysis of sea ice concentration information alone. The resulting inter-annual variations in winter processes are likely to affect the dynamics of Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba).																	0722-4060					MAY	2011	34	5					683	692		10.1007/s00300-010-0924-7							WOS:000289481400007

Metal and antibiotic-resistance in psychrotrophic bacteria from Antarctic Marine waters	ECOTOXICOLOGY												In the wake of the findings that Antarctic krills concentrate heavy metals at ppm level, (Yamamoto et al. 1987), the Antarctic waters from the Indian side were examined for the incidence of metal and antibiotic-resistant bacteria during the austral summer (13th Indian Antarctic expedition) along the cruise track extending from 50 degrees S and 18 degrees E to 65 degrees S and 30 degrees E. The bacterial isolates from these waters showed varying degrees of resistance to antibiotics (Chloramphenicol, ampicillin, streptomycin, tetracycline and kanamycin) and metals (K2CrO4, CdCl2, ZnCl2 and HgCl2) tested. Of the isolates screened, about 29% and 16% were resistant to 100 ppm of cadmium and chromium salt respectively. Tolerance to lower concentration (10 ppm) of mercury (Hg) was observed in 68% of the isolates. Depending on the antibiotics the isolates showed different percentage of resistance. Multiple drug and metal-resistance were observed. High incidence of resistance to both antibiotics and metals were common among the pigmented bacterial isolates. Increased resistance decreased the ability of bacteria to express enzymes. The results reiterate previous findings by other researchers that the waters of southern ocean may not be exempt from the spread of metal and antibiotic-resistance.																	0963-9292	1573-3017				MAY	2006	15	4					379	384		10.1007/s10646-006-0068-2							WOS:000238518000010	16703457

Results supported the hypothesis of a functional relationship between egg production and molt development for the duration of the reproductive season (March to August), with one reproductive cycle being made up of two molt cycles. Females remained in reproductive condition throughout the reproductive season, and the timing of their spawning and molting was synchronized at the population level throughout this period. A semiempirical model predicted that the krill population produced an egg pulse every 20 to 26 d (depending on temperature), and three cohorts were evident in net samples taken later in the year. The likely date on which the first cohort was spawned was around 26 d after the main phytoplankton bloom, suggesting that the bloom triggered egg development in all adult females. Such a synchronized spawning period was observed directly in adult females 26 d after a bloom in March 2000. A total of three cohorts over the 6-month reproductive season is less than the maximum of seven that would be possible if spawning occurred at a periodicity of between 20 and 26 d, suggesting that larval recruitment was not always successful. Analysis showed that successful recruitment was only achieved when chlorophyll a levels were adequate during both the period of egg maturation in the ovary and the subsequent development of larvae, especially the furcilia stages.																	0024-3590					SEP	2003	48	5					2020	2033		10.4319/lo.2003.48.5.2020							WOS:000185433700028

Among them, only 38 species were previously described, while at least 116 morphotypes (75%) represent species new to science. The faunal overlap of Antarctic Cumacea (Peracarida) is calculated between various deep-sea basins, between the deep sea and the shelf, and between different shelf areas of Antarctica and the Sub Antarctic islands. The degree of endemism is high (about 80%) for the Antarctic Cumacea, but within the Antarctic regions faunal overlaps are detectable. Maximal faunal overlap (about 50%) is found among the Antarctic shelf regions, but the deep-sea basins of the Antarctic Peninsula region and the Weddell Sea have also a high (about 30%) species overlap. Including the new findings of Cumacea from the various deep-sea basins, the overlap between the Antarctic shelf and the deep sea is only 18%. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Here we report on the successful use of micro geolocation logging sensor tags to track the movements, and activity, of four leopard seals for trips of between 142-446 days including one individual in two separate years. Whilst the sample size is small the results represent an advance in our limited knowledge of leopard seals. We show the longest periods of tracking of leopard seals' migratory behaviour between the pack ice, close to the Antarctic continent, and the sub-Antarctic island of South Georgia. It appears that these tracked animals migrate in a directed manner towards Bird Island and, during their residency, use this as a central place for foraging trips as well as exploiting the local penguin and seal populations. Movements to the South Orkney Islands were also recorded, similar to those observed in other predators in the region including the krill fishery. Analysis of habitat associations, taking into account location errors, indicated the tracked seals had an affinity for shallow shelf water and regions of sea ice. Wet and dry sensors revealed that seals hauled out for between 22 and 31% of the time with maximum of 74 hours and a median of between 9 and 11 hours. The longest period a seal remained in the water was between 13 and 25 days. Fitting GAMMs showed that haul out rates changed throughout the year with the highest values occurring during the summer which has implications for visual surveys. Peak haul out occurred around midday for the months between October and April but was more evenly spread across the day between May and September. The seals' movements between, and behaviour within, areas important to breeding populations of birds and other seals, coupled with the dynamics of the region's fisheries, shows an understanding of leopard seal ecology is vital in the management of the Southern Ocean resources.

We report evidence that significant levels of the artificial radionuclides Sr-90, Cs-137, Am-241 and plutonium isotopes can be found in sponges, bivalves, krill and demersal fish fauna of Terra Nova Bay (Ross Sea), sometimes with a seasonal pattern. Increasing concentrations of Cs-137 were detected in the bivalve Adamussium colbecki (Antarctic scallop) during austral summer months, as a result of major trophic activity and changes in metabolic rates. Bioconcentration factors for artificial radionuclides in different Antarctic species are presented and discussed in relation to their different trophic strategies. Unexpectedly high radiocesium bioconcentration factors determined in bivalves suggested the particular role played by filter feeding in bioaccumulation, particularly in summer when radionuclide bioavailability is enhanced. The feeding preference of the trematomiid fish Trematomus bernacchii for the scallop A. colbecki is confirmed, not only by fish gut content analyses, but also through radiometric results.

Different techniques were applied to precisely evaluate dietary quality and quality of fish growth performance. Inverse relationship between trypsin specific activity (T) and ratio of trypsin to chymotrypsin (T/C ratio) as a result of increased chymotrypsin specific activity (C) in the pyloric ceca indicated fish growth status as a reduction in growth rate. These protease values in the feces could also indicate fish digestive efficiency, but could not predict fish growth status. There were relationships among feed conversion efficiency (FCE), in vitro digestibility, and pyloric cecal T/C ratio, with inverse levels of krill meal in the diets. Krill meal seemed to increase muscle protein concentration through increasing protein retention, as capacity for protein synthesis was reduced. Dietary quality tests by in vitro digestibility were corresponded with growth studies, and indicated a possibility of inclusion of krill meal at 50-60% replacements, and larger fish were more sensitive to dietary quality than smaller ones. At 80-100% replacements, in vitro digestibility and FCE reduced, and oocyte quality changed through increased trypsin-like specific activity probably because of less or abnormal oocyte development.																	0145-8884	1745-4514				AUG	2007	31	4					509	540		10.1111/j.1745-4514.2007.00127.x							WOS:000247818200005

Fewer but Not Smaller Schools in Declining Fish and Krill Populations	CURRENT BIOLOGY												Many pelagic species (species that live in the water column), including herring and krill, aggregate to form schools, shoals, or swarms (hereafter simply "schools,'' although the words are not synonyms). Schools provide benefits to individual members, including locomotory economy [1] and protection from predators that prey on individuals [2], but paradoxically make schooling species energetically viable and commercially attractive targets for predators of groups [3] and for fishers. Large schools are easier to find and yield greater prey/catch than small schools, and there is a requirement from fields as diverse as theoretical ecology and fisheries management to understand whether and how aggregation sizes change with changing population size. We collated data from vertical echosounder surveys of taxonomically diverse pelagic stocks from geographically diverse ecosystems [4-6]. The data contain common significant positive linear stock-biomass to school-number relationships. They show that the numbers of schools in the stocks change with changing stock biomass and suggest that the distributions of school sizes do not change with stock biomass. New data that we collected using a multibeam sonar [7], which can image entire schools, contained the same stock-biomass to school-number relationship and confirm that the distribution of school sizes is not related to changing stock size: put simply, as stocks decline, individuals are distributed among fewer schools, not smaller schools. Since school characteristics affect catchability (the ease or difficulty with which fishers can capture target species) [8] and availability of prey to predators [3], our findings have commercial and ecological implications, particularly within the aspirational framework of ecosystem-based management of marine systems [9, 10].

R.; Thorpe, Sally E.; Ward, Peter; Atkinson, Angus			Do pelagic grazers benefit from sea ice? Insights from the Antarctic sea ice proxy IPSO25	BIOGEOSCIENCES												Sea ice affects primary production in polar regions in multiple ways. It can dampen water column productivity by reducing light or nutrient supply, provide a habitat for ice algae and condition the marginal ice zone (MIZ) for phytoplankton blooms on its seasonal retreat. The relative importance of three different carbon sources (sea ice derived, sea ice conditioned, non-sea-ice associated) for the polar food web is not well understood, partly due to the lack of methods that enable their unambiguous distinction. Here we analysed two highly branched isoprenoid (HBI) biomarkers to trace sea-ice-derived and sea-ice-conditioned carbon in Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) and relate their concentrations to the grazers' body reserves, growth and recruitment. During our sampling in January-February 2003, the proxy for sea ice diatoms (a di-unsaturated HBI termed IPSO25, delta C-13 = -12.5 +/- 3.3 parts per thousand) occurred in open waters of the western Scotia Sea, where seasonal ice retreat was slow. In suspended matter from surface waters, IPSO25 was present at a few stations close to the ice edge, but in krill the marker was widespread. Even at stations that had been ice-free for several weeks, IPSO25 was found in krill stomachs, suggesting that they gathered the ice-derived algae from below the upper mixed layer. Peak abundances of the proxy for MIZ diatoms (a tri-unsaturated HBI termed HBI III, delta C-13 = -42.2 +/- 2.4 parts per thousand) occurred in regions of fast sea ice retreat and persistent salinity-driven stratification in the eastern Scotia Sea. Krill sampled in the area defined by the ice edge bloom likewise contained high amounts of HBI III. As indicators for the grazer's performance we used the mass-length ratio, size of digestive gland and growth rate for krill, and recruitment for the biomass-dominant calanoid copepods Calanoides acutus and Calanus propinquus. These indices consistently point to blooms in the MIZ as an important feeding ground for pelagic grazers. Even though ice-conditioned blooms are of much shorter duration than blooms downstream of the permanently sea-ice-free South Georgia, they enabled fast growth and offspring development. Our study shows two rarely considered ways that pelagic grazers may benefit from sea ice: firstly, after their release from sea ice, suspended or sinking ice algae can supplement the grazers' diet if phytoplankton concentrations are low. Secondly, conditioning effects of seasonal sea ice can promote pelagic primary production and therefore food availability in spring and summer.

Inter-Annual Variation of Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPS) in an Antarctic Top Predator Arctocephalus gazella	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Persistent organic pollutants (POPs), contaminants that may bioaccumulate in upper trophic level organisms, were detected in the milk of a top predator, the Antarctic fur seal (Arctocephalus gazella). Multiparous females had significantly lower concentrations of certain POPs (trans-nonachlor, p,p'-DDE, and several PCBs) in their milk than primiparous females, likely due to the annual lactational transfer of the POP burden from mother to pup. Furthermore, there were significant interannual differences in POP concentrations in multiparous females' milk from five breeding seasons between 2000 and 2011. Decreasing trends in concentrations of certain POPs over the recent decade coincide with declining global emissions, yet atmospheric concentrations in the Antarctic are not always consistent with global trends, suggesting that additional factors may contribute to temporal trends of POPs in fur seals. Climate shifts and corresponding availability of krill over the past decade were not consistent with trends observed in POP concentrations in fur seal milk, suggesting that climate may not be a key factor. Additional mechanisms, such as variability in the geographic ranges of individual seals during overwintering migrations are discussed and should be explored further.																	0013-936X	1520-5851				NOV 19	2013	47	22					12744	12752		10.1021/es403577f							WOS:000327360600018	24138491

Spatial and temporal variability in the fish diet of Antarctic fur seal (Arctocephalus gazella) in the Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY-REVUE CANADIENNE DE ZOOLOGIE												The spatial and temporal variability in the fish component of the diet of Antarctic fur seals (Arctocephalus gazella (Peters, 1875)) in the Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean was examined using diet data from 10 sites in the region including a 13-year time series from South Georgia. The fish species composition in the diet at each site showed a strong relationship with the local marine habitat/topography. The absence of formerly harvested fish species indicates a lack of recovery of stocks of Notothenia rossii Richardson, 1844 at South Georgia and Champsocephalus gunnari Lonnberg, 1905 at the South Orkney Islands. At South Georgia, Protomyctophum choriodon Hulley, 1981, Lepidonotothen larseni (Lonnberg, 1905), and C. gunnari were the most important species in the diet between 1991 and 2004. Variability in the occurrence of C. gunnari was driven mainly by annual scale processes, particularly those that influence the availability of Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba (Dana, 1852)). The occurrence of the pelagic P. choriodon was primarily influenced by shorter-term water mass changes within the foraging range of the seals. The fish composition in the diet reflects differences in marine habitat/topography, as well as variability, at a range of time scales that reflect environmental variability and harvesting.

Seasonal variation in the diet of Antarctic fur seals, Arctocephalus gazella, at 25 de Mayo/King George Island, South Shetland Islands, Antarctica	POLAR BIOLOGY												Assessing the trophic ecology of fur seals is essential for defining their roles as a top predator in Antarctic marine ecosystems. To this end, we examined the diet of Antarctic fur seals, Arctocephalus gazella, in the South Shetlands. While previous studies have considered the diet of this species at this location in summer, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to report on the diet of this population in winter, thus adding essential information on the extent of seasonal variation. A total of 224 scats were collected in the winter 2004 (n = 118) and summer 2004/2005 (n = 106) on the coasts of Stranger Point, Isla 25 de Mayo/King George. For the total study period krill (Euphausia superba) was the main prey taxon, followed by fish, cephalopods and penguins. During winter Pleuragramma antarcticum was dominant, while myctophids were almost absent. Conversely, in summer Electrona antarctica and Gymnoscopelus nicholsi, followed by P. antarcticum, dominated the fish diet. It is concluded that fur seals centred their foraging activity on a krill community and fish associated with krill aggregations.																	0722-4060	1432-2056				FEB	2017	40	2					471	475		10.1007/s00300-016-1959-1							WOS:000393761500020

Mesoscale structure and oceanographic determinants of krill hotspots in the California Current: Implications for trophic transfer and conservation	PROGRESS IN OCEANOGRAPHY												Krill (crustaceans of the family Euphausiacea) comprise an important prey field for vast array of fish, birds, and marine mammals in the California Current and other large marine ecosystems globally. In this study, we test the hypothesis that mesoscale spatial organization of krill is related to oceanographic conditions associated with coastal upwelling. To test this, we compiled a climatology of krill distributions based on hydroacoustic surveys off California in May-June each year between 2000 and 2009 (missing 2007). Approximately 53,000 km of ocean habitat was sampled, resulting in a comprehensive geo-spatial data set from the Southern California Bight to Cape Mendocino. We determined the location and characteristics of eight definite and two probable krill "hotspots" of abundance. Directional-dependence analysis revealed that krill hotspots were oriented in a northwest-southeast (135 degrees) direction, corresponding to the anisotropy of the 200-2000 m isobath. Krill hotspots were disassociated (inversely correlated) with three upwelling centers, Point Arena, Point Sur, and Point Conception, suggesting that krill may avoid locations of strong offshore transport or aggregate downstream from these locations. While current fisheries management considers the entire coast out to the 2000 m isobath critical habitat for krill in this ecosystem, we establish here smaller scale structuring of this critical mid-trophic level prey resource. Identifying mesoscale krill hotspots and their oceanographic determinants is significant as these smaller ecosystem divisions may warrant protection to ensure key ecosystem functions (i.e., trophic transfer) and resilience. Furthermore, delineating and quantifying krill hotspots may be important for conservation of krill-predators in this system. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

The Gullmarsfjord (West Sweden) and the Clyde Sea (West Scotland) resident populations followed the same basic pattern of development as the Kattegat (between Denmark and Sweden) and the Ligurian Sea (Northwest Mediterranean) populations, but the fjord krill reached a comparatively larger body size during their second year of life. The positive relationship between body size and fecundity means that fjord populations are potentially more productive than those of the open sea. High rates of moulting and spawning activity were limited to the spring and summer despite the fact that trophic conditions still seemed favourable in early autumn. We show here that, in autumn, the adult moult cycle became longer and growth stopped, large 2-year-old krill disappeared from the population and ovarian development was arrested. Resources already accumulated ill the oocytes (glycoproteic and lipid yolk) were recovered by oosorption and ovaries regressed for a winter rest. Autumn trophic conditions were still favourable in both sites, especially in terms of copepod abundance. However, the phytoplankton community changed from a dominance of diatoms in early season to dinoflagellates in late summer. We suggest that these changes triggered the autumn arrest of krill production. (C) 2004 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

A.; Webb, Karen; Linse, Katrin			Slow growth of Antarctic bryozoans increases over 20 years and is anomalously high in 2003	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												Some organisms are particularly appropriate models for investigation of variability in time and space for given environments. The erect bryozoan Cellarinella nutti, an endemic Antarctic species, is one such organism: it is extremely abundant, occurs from the polar front to the Antarctic continental edge, and preserves a clear macroscopic environmental record in its skeleton (growth check lines). We studied variability in the growth of 93 C. nutti individuals at depths between 247 and 414 m, at sites 1, 10, 100 and > 1000 km apart in the Weddell Sea, Antarctica. Trawled C. nutti varied from 5 to 23 yr in age, and nearly half the colonies had grown asexually from fragments. We measured the annual growth increments, which ranged from similar to 18 zooids (8.6 mg dry mass, 0.8 mg ash-free dry mass; Age 1) to similar to 130 zooids (43 mg dry mass, 2.48 mg ash-free dry mass; Age 20). At 9 yr (the modal age), each C. nutti individual had precipitated > 182 mg CaCO3, and by 20 yr nearly 580 mg. C. nutti grows slowly compared with other erect bryozoans, even those in the Antarctic. We found colony and site to be insignificant factors in its growth, despite the large range of distances between sites, but year was highly significant. We found a non-linear increase in growth spanning the last 2 decades that has no obvious relation to El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO)-associated environmental fluctuations. In particular we found that growth in 2003 was greater than in any other year measured by a factor of 2. Given its abundance, longevity, ubiquity in Antarctic waters, insignificant spatial variability in growth, but distinct annual variability, C. nutti may prove to be an important species to investigate whether benthic organisms, as well as krill, salps and fur seals, are beginning to develop major climate-related changes in phenology.

The macrozooplankton of the cosmonaut sea, east Antarctica (30 degrees E-60 degrees E),1987-1990	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART I-OCEANOGRAPHIC RESEARCH PAPERS												The macrozooplankton of the Cosmonaut Sea, Indian sector of the Southern Ocean, were investigated during the austral summers (January/February) of 1987, 1988, 1989 and 1990. Macrozooplankton samples were collected with Bongo and MT nets in the top 200 m of the water column, along with integrated temperature and salinity. Multivariate analysis of macrozooplankton density data identified a consistent division between the assemblage structure of the neritic and oceanic zones, the latter being characterized by a number of species unique to the continental shelf including Euphausia crystallorophias, Pleuragramma antarcticum and Notothenia kempi. Samples collected in the oceanic zone were all located within the Coastal Current (CC), south of the Southern Boundary of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC). However, in both 1987 and 1988 water masses of ACC origin had been injected into the CC. These intrusions were an important but inter-annually variable source of mesoscale spatial variability, being associated with distinct macrozooplankton assemblage structure and densities. Inter-annually there was considerable variation in macrozooplankton densities and biomass. Densities, dominated by Eukrohnia hamata, Thysanoessa macrura and Euphausia superba (krill), averaged similar to 250 ind.1000 m(-3) 3 from 1987 to 1989, but reached > 750 ind.1000 m(-3) in 1990, largely due to higher densities of E hamata. Biomass was dominated by krill, and total levels reflected the decline in biomass of this species from 1986 to 1990. A number of significant correlations were identified between species densities and temperature and/or salinity. However, the wide biogeographic ranges of most species indicated that these correlations were largely spurious. Overall, the differences between macrozooplankton assemblages in ACC and CC water masses within years, and the differences in macrozooplankton densities between years, most likely reflected the different histories of spatially or temporally separated water masses that were structured by a combination of bottom-up and top-down processes. Comparison of the data from this study with other regions in the Antarctic demonstrated that there is considerable circumpolar consistency in the taxonomic composition of Antarctic macrozooplankton communities, although the densities and proportional contribution of species varies both spatially and temporally. The occurrence of a krill-dominated assemblage, characterized by low densities of other species, indicates that this species has a significant top-down impact on zooplankton communities. The spatial and temporal variation in krill biomass may therefore be a significant determinant of both mesoscale and circumpolar variation in the contribution of other taxonomic groups to Antarctic zooplankton assemblages. Locally, the decline in krill biomass in the Cosmonaut Sea between 1987 and 1990 indicated a weaker connection with the Cooperation Sea to the east, where the opposite trend was observed, than previously thought. Separation between these two seas is probably facilitated in part by the anti-cyclonic gyres observed in both regions. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

DVM of the euphausiid Euphausia eximia off northern Chile in the spring of 2015 was documented based on acoustic measurements using an echo sounder along with net samplings. Dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations were obtained using a vertical profiler, and water samples were collected to obtain in situ nitrite (NO2-) concentrations as well as pH(T), total alkalinity (AT), and therefore carbon dioxide partial pressure (pCO(2)) was estimated. Krill were found to migrate up to the surface (0-50 m) during the night and returned to ca. 200-300 m depth during the day, spending between 11 and 14 h at these layers. At the surface, DO and NO2- concentrations were 208 and 0.14 mu M respectively, while pH(T) was 8.04 and 405 mu atm pCO(2). In contrast, at the deeper layers (200-300 m), DO and NO2- were<3 and 6.3 <mu>M respectively, with pH(T) 7.53 and 1490 mu atm pCO(2). The pH(T) and high pCO(2) values at depths represent the conditions predicted for open ocean waters in a worst-case global warming scenario by 2150. The acoustic scatter suggested that>60% of the krill swarms enter the OMZ and anoxic waters during the daytime. These frequent migrations suggest that krill can tolerate such extreme conditions associated with anoxic and high-pCO(2) waters. The inferences drawn from the observation of these migrations might have strong implications for the current oceanic carbon pump models, highlighting the need for understanding the molecular and physiological adaptations allowing these migrations.

J	NAGY, KA; OBST, BS				NAGY, KA; OBST, BS			FOOD AND ENERGY-REQUIREMENTS OF ADELIE PENGUINS (PYGOSCELIS-ADELIAE) ON THE ANTARCTIC PENINSULA	PHYSIOLOGICAL ZOOLOGY												Adelie penguins (mean body mass 3.81 kg) brooding small chicks bad field metabolic rates (FMRs, measured using doubly labeled water) averaging 1.64 mL CO2 g-1 h-1, equivalent to 3,896 kj d-1 and 3.8 times basal metabolic rate (BMR). Energy utilization while on the nest was 2.0 X BMR, and it was 5.4 X BMR when off the nest, including time spent foraging at sea. These FMRs are higher than in other species of penguins and may reflect an intense foraging effort associated with a relative scarcity of food during our study. The penguins ate only krill (Euphausia superba), primarily juveniles of intermediate size, which contain much water, little lipid, and relatively low metabolizable energy content compared to gravid female krill. Low water intake rates indicated that the penguins did not drink much fresh water or seawater and that they did not consume quite enough food to pay their own energy expenses after feeding their chicks. Their utilization of body fat to pay the difference should have amounted to about 33 g d-1 during this phase of the breeding cycle. We estimated that the 25,500 Adelie penguins using the Arthur Harbor area around Palmer Station would consume about 27.5 metric tons of krill each day. Six hundred twelve penguins (total biomass of 2,330 kg) would consume about the same amount of krill per day as does one Antarctic fin whale weighing 48,000 kg.																	0031-935X					NOV-DEC	1992	65	6					1271	1284		10.1086/physzool.65.6.30158279							WOS:A1992KP95800012						
J	CRIPPS, GC				CRIPPS, GC			NATURAL AND ANTHROPOGENIC HYDROCARBONS IN THE ANTARCTIC MARINE-ENVIRONMENT	MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN												The Antarctic marine environment contains a range of hydrocarbons at low concentrations, which are generally biogenic in origin. All major classes of hydrocarbons have been found in the Antarctic ecosystem. At present, anthropogenic input is very low and difficult to resolve from background levels. Pollution in the Antarctic is limited to only a few sources and although contamination can be locally chronic it is very restricted in extent. To date there have been few studies of hydrocarbon pollution and those available have been patchy in spatial coverage and generally lack time-series data. The low levels of natural hydrocarbons and restricted human activity make the Antarctic ecosystem suitable as an indicator of global hydrocarbon pollution.																	0025-326X	1879-3363					1992	25	9-12					266	273		10.1016/0025-326X(92)90681-U							WOS:A1992KX53100011

Polar organisms are reported to bioaccumulate lipophilic contaminant, viz persistent organic pollutants (POPS). Legacy POPs and flame retardants (polybrominated diphenyl ethers, PBDEs) were studied in key species of the Ross Sea (Euphausia superba, Pleuragramma antarctica) and their predators (Dissostichus mawsoni, Pygoscelis adeliae, Aptenodytes forsteri, Catharacta maccormicki, Leptonychotes weddellii). Gaschromatography revealed the presence of PCBs, HCB, DDTs, PBDEs in most of the samples; HCHs, dieldrin, Eldrin, non-ortho PCBs, PCDDs, PCDFs were detected only in some species. The average Sigma PBDEs was 0.19-1.35 pg/g wet wt in the key-species and one-two order of magnitude higher in the predators. Penguins and skuas from an area where a long-term field camp is located showed higher BDE concentrations. The Sigma DDTs was higher in the Antarctic toothfish (20 +/- 6.73 ng/g wet wt) and in the South Polar skua (5.911 +/- 3.425 ng/g wet wt). The TEQ5 were evaluated and the highest concentration was found in the Weddell seal, due to PCB169, 1,2,3,4,7,8-HxCDF, and 2,3,4,6,7,8-HxCDF. There was no significant relationship between the trophic level and the POP concentrations. Although low concentrations, organisms of the Ross Sea trophic web should be further studied: lack of information on some ecotoxicological features and human impacts including global change may distress the ecosystem with unpredictable effects.

Endemic Nototheniinae is the dominant fish group found in Antarctic marine habitats. Through their intermediate position within the food web, Nototheniinae link lower to higher trophic levels and thereby also form an important component of parasite life cycles. The study was set out to gain insight into the parasite fauna of Nototheniops larseni, N. nudifrons and Lepidonotothen squamifrons (Nototheniinae) from Elephant Island (Antarctica). Methods Sampling was conducted at three locations around Elephant Island during the ANT-XXVIII/4 expedition of the research vessel Polarstern. The parasite fauna of three Nototheniine species was analysed, and findings were compared to previous parasitological and ecological research collated from a literature review. Results All host species shared the parasites Neolebouria antarctica (Digenea), Corynosoma bullosum (Acanthocephala) and Pseudoterranova decipiens E (Nematoda). Other parasite taxa were exclusive to one host species in this study. Nototheniops nudifrons was infected by Ascarophis nototheniae (Nematoda), occasional infections of N. larseni with Echinorhynchus petrotschenkoi (Acanthocephala) and L. squamifrons with Elytrophalloides oatesi (Digenea) and larval tetraphyllidean Cestoda were detected. Conclusion All examined fish species' parasites were predominantly euryxenous regarding their fish hosts. The infection of Lepidonotothen squamifrons with Lepidapedon garrardi (Digenea) and Nototheniops larseni with Echinorhynchus petrotschenkoi represent new host records. Despite the challenges and limited opportunities for fishing in remote areas, future studies should continue sampling on a more regular basis and include a larger number of fish species and sampling sites within different habitats.																	1230-2821	1896-1851															10.1007/s11686-021-00455-8		JUL 2021					WOS:000673804000002	34275092

ANNUAL CHANGES IN SPECIES COMPOSITION AND ABUNDANCE OF MYCTOPHID FISH IN THE NORTH OF SOUTH GEORGIA (SUBAREA 48.3), ANTARCTICA, DURING AUSTRAL WINTERS FROM 2002 TO 2008	CCAMLR SCIENCE												Species composition and abundance of myctophid fish were analysed using the fish by-catch samples collected by scientific observers on board Japanese commercial krill fishing vessels in the area north and northwest of South Georgia, Antarctica, during austral winters from 2002 to 2008. A total of 10 myctophid species were identified in the by-catch samples, among which Krefftichthys anderssoni, Gymnoscopelus nicholsi and Protomyctophum choriodon were abundant. Different life stages of K. anderssoni and G. nicholsi from larvae to adults were found, suggesting that these species may have their nursery ground around South Georgia. Electrona antarctica was not a major component of the recent mesopelagic ichthyofauna in this area, although this species used to be dominant in the Antarctic coastal waters. In contrast, P. choriodon, which is known as a south temperate species, became dominant in recent samples. Additionally, the size distribution of P. choriodon was unimodal, indicating that individuals in the samples belonged to the same size group and probably migrated from the population in warmer northern areas.																	1023-4063						2011	18						155	165									WOS:000208703000011

Variability and change in the west Antarctic Peninsula marine system: Research priorities and opportunities	PROGRESS IN OCEANOGRAPHY												The west Antarctic Peninsula (WAP) region has undergone significant changes in temperature and seasonal ice dynamics since the mid-twentieth century, with strong impacts on the regional ecosystem, ocean chemistry and hydrographic properties. Changes to these long-term trends of warming and sea ice decline have been observed in the 21st century, but their consequences for ocean physics, chemistry and the ecology of the high-productivity shelf ecosystem are yet to be fully established. The WAP shelf is important for regional krill stocks and higher trophic levels, whilst the degree of variability and change in the physical environment and documented biological and biogeochemical responses make this a model system for how climate and sea ice changes might restructure highlatitude ecosystems. Although this region is arguably the best-measured and best-understood shelf region around Antarctica, significant gaps remain in spatial and temporal data capable of resolving the atmosphere-ice-ocean-ecosystem feedbacks that control the dynamics and evolution of this complex polar system. Here we summarise the current state of knowledge regarding the key mechanisms and interactions regulating the physical, biogeochemical and biological processes at work, the ways in which the shelf environment is changing, and the ecosystem response to the changes underway. We outline the overarching cross-disciplinary priorities for future research, as well as the most important discipline-specific objectives. Underpinning these priorities and objectives is the need to better define the causes, magnitude and timescales of variability and change at all levels of the system. A combination of traditional and innovative approaches will be critical to addressing these priorities and developing a co-ordinated observing system for the WAP shelf, which is required to detect and elucidate change into the future.

Interannual variation in the diet of non-breeding male Antarctic fur seals, Arctocephalus gazella, at Isla 25 de Mayo/King George Island	POLAR BIOLOGY												The diet of non-breeding male Antarctic fur seals, Arctocephalus gazella, was investigated at Stranger Point, King George Island, through the analysis of scats during three consecutive summer seasons (1996, 1997, 1998). Overall, fish and krill were the most frequent prey occurring, respectively, in an average of 82.9% and 78.8% of samples (n = 131), followed by penguins (22.8%) and cephalopods (17.8%). Myctophids constituted almost 90% of the fish predated, with Electrona antarctica and Gymnoscopelus nicholsi being the most abundant and frequent species consumed. All fish taxa identified were krill feeding species suggesting that seals foraged mainly on a krill and a fish community associated with krill aggregations. However, a seasonal change was observed in the relative proportions of the different prey taxa, with a progressive decrease with time in the occurrence of krill and a concomitant increase of fish, penguins and squid. Possible influence of the strong 1997/98 ENSO event is discussed.																	0722-4060	1432-2056				OCT	2008	31	11					1365	1372		10.1007/s00300-008-0475-3							WOS:000260286400008

Transmission electron microscopy of the midgut glands was applied to find out the nutritional status of the animals, which contained a broad variety of food items in their stomachs. In contrast to the Antarctic krill, the three carideans possess a dual filter system; primary filters in the cardia and secondary filters in the pyloric chamber. Morphologically, the mandibles and stomachs of the three species vary considerably; however, their food items are similar. We conclude that stomach contents do not really reflect the different modes of life or habitat preferences of the investigated species.

Trophodynamics of Protomyctophum (Myctophidae) in the Scotia Sea (Southern Ocean)	JOURNAL OF FISH BIOLOGY												This study investigated spatial and temporal patterns in distribution, population structure and diet of Bolin's lanternfish Protomyctophum bolini, Tenison's lanternfish Protomyctophum tenisoni and gaptooth lanternfish Protomyctophum choriodon in the Scotia Sea using data collected by midwater trawl during spring, summer and autumn. Protomyctophum bolini was the most abundant species of the genus encountered throughout the Scotia Sea with the greatest concentrations occurring around the Antarctic Polar Front (APF). This species had a life cycle of 2+years, but spatial differences in population structure were apparent as the I-group was absent from all regions south of the APF, suggesting that the species does not recruit in the Scotia Sea. Protomyctophum tenisoni occurred mostly in waters characteristic of the APF and was absent from the southern Scotia Sea. It had a limited size range, but there was clear size-related sexual dimorphism with males significantly larger than females. The species had a life cycle of c. 2years, but the I-group (c. 1year old, 1 November to 31 October the next year) occurred only in regions close to the APF suggesting that recruitment is restricted to these waters. A seasonal southward migration for P. choriodon is likely as the species occurred mostly to the south-west of South Georgia in summer, but extended to the sea-ice sectors in autumn. Protomyctophum choriodon had a life cycle of 4+years in the Scotia Sea and the population was dominated by age classes >3years old. Larval stages were absent during the surveys for all species. Diurnal variations in vertical distribution were apparent for all three species. Interspecific variations in diet were evident, but all species were primarily copepod feeders, with Metridia spp., Rhincalanus gigas and Calanus simillimus generally dominating their diet. Small euphausiids, principally Thysanoessa spp., were also an important component of their diets, particularly for P. choriodon which had the largest body size. The spatial and temporal variations in diet for both P. bolini and P. tenisoni were broadly consistent with underlying abundance patterns within the mesozooplankton community.

J	Wege, M; Salas, L; LaRue, M				Wege, Mia; Salas, Leo; LaRue, Michelle			Ice matters: Life-history strategies of two Antarctic seals dictate climate change eventualities in the Weddell Sea	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY												The impacts of climate change in Antarctica and the Southern Ocean are not uniform and ice-obligate species with dissimilar life-history characteristics will likely respond differently to their changing ecosystems. We use a unique data set of Weddell Leptonychotes weddellii and crabeater seals' (CESs) Lobodon carcinophaga breeding season distribution in the Weddell Sea, determined from satellite imagery. We contrast the theoretical climate impacts on both ice-obligate predators who differ in life-history characteristics: CESs are highly specialized Antarctic krill Euphausia superba predators and breed in the seasonal pack ice; Weddell seals (WESs) are generalist predators and breed on comparatively stable fast ice. We used presence-absence data and a suite of remotely sensed environmental variables to build habitat models. Each of the environmental predictors is multiplied by a 'climate change score' based on known responses to climate change to create a 'change importance product'. Results show CESs are more sensitive to climate change than WESs. Crabeater seals prefer to breed close to krill, and the compounding effects of changing sea ice concentrations and sea surface temperatures, the proximity to krill and abundance of stable breeding ice, can influence their post-breeding foraging success and ultimately their future breeding success. But in contrast to the Ross Sea, here WESs prefer to breed closer to larger colonies of emperor penguins (Aptenodytes forsteri). This suggests that the Weddell Sea may currently be prey-abundant, allowing the only two air-breathing Antarctic silverfish predators (Pleuragramma antarctica) (WESs and emperor penguins) to breed closer to each other. This is the first basin-scale, region-specific comparison of breeding season habitat in these two key Antarctic predators based on real-world data to compare climate change responses. This work shows that broad-brush, basin-scale approaches to understanding species-specific responses to climate change are not always appropriate, and regional models are needed-especially when designing marine protected areas.

J	Malloy, KD; Holman, MA; Mitchell, D; Detrich, HW				Malloy, KD; Holman, MA; Mitchell, D; Detrich, HW			Solar UVB-induced DNA damage and photoenzymatic DNA repair in Antarctic zooplankton	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA												The detrimental effects of elevated intensities of mid-UV radiation (UVB), a result of stratospheric ozone depletion during the austral spring, on the primary producers of the Antarctic marine ecosystem have been well documented. Here we report that natural populations of Antarctic zooplankton also sustain significant DNA damage [measured as cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs)] during periods of increased UVB flux. This is the first direct evidence that increased solar UVB may result in damage to marine organisms other than primary producers in Antarctica. The extent of DNA damage in pelagic icefish eggs correlated with daily incident UVB irradiance, reflecting the difference between acquisition and repair of CPDs. Patterns of DNA damage in fish larvae did not correlate with daily UVB flux, possibly due to different depth distributions and/or different capacities for DNA repair. Clearance of CPDs by Antarctic fish and krill was mediated primarily by the photoenzymatic repair system. Although repair rates were large for all species evaluated, they were apparently inadequate to prevent the transient accumulation of substantial CPD burdens. The capacity for DNA repair in Antarctic organisms was highest in those species whose early life history stages occupy the water column during periods of ozone depletion (austral spring) and lowest in fish species whose eggs and larvae are abundant during winter. Although the potential reduction in fitness of Antarctic zooplankton resulting from DNA damage is unknown, we suggest that increased solar UV may reduce recruitment and adversely affect trophic transfer of productivity by affecting heterotrophic species as well as primary producers.																	0027-8424					FEB 18	1997	94	4					1258	1263		10.1073/pnas.94.4.1258							WOS:A1997WJ62100038	9037040

Cluster analysis and multi-dimensional scaling revealed 4 major groups of stations within each ordination that broadly corresponded geographically. A grouping of stations to the east of the Antarctic Peninsula was characterised by low phytoplankton cell counts. The corresponding grouping of stations in the mesozooplankton data were characterised by low abundance, overwintered state of many species, low egg production rates, and low carbon mass of copepod instars. In contrast, groupings of stations in the northern part of the Scotia Sea were characterised as chlorophyll and mesozooplankton rich, and the summer generation was well advanced. Latitude was most strongly correlated with mesozooplankton community pattern (rank correlation p = 0.608), whereas surface chlorophyll a was a weaker correlate (p = 0.344) but along with measures of size-fractioned chlorophyll contributed towards explaining variation in species stages carbon mass and egg production rates. Additional hauls to 1000 m with an LHPR indicated copepod populations were broadly in an overwintered state in the south of the region, whereas to the north of South Georgia recruitment had been completed and some species were undergoing a seasonal descent. A comparison with January/February 2000 revealed higher abundances of krill larvae throughout the Scotia Sea in 2000 as well as a more advanced generation of the copepod Calanoides acutus. Ice cover during the 2 years differed considerably; in 2000 the position of the summer ice edge broadly accorded with the 25 yr average, whereas in 2003 the ice edge lay much further north than usual. We suggest that the timing of ice retreat influenced the timing of reproduction with the late retreat in 2003 causing delayed reproduction and reduced population sizes.

J	MCKENNA, JE				MCKENNA, JE			TROPHIC RELATIONSHIPS WITHIN THE ANTARCTIC DEMERSAL FISH COMMUNITY OF SOUTH GEORGIA ISLAND	FISHERY BULLETIN												Knowledge of trophic relationships is vital to understanding any ecological community. The trophic relationships of Antarctic demersal fish are poorly known and have been described quantitatively by only a few researchers. Gut contents were analyzed on over 300 stomachs from fish collected during the 1987-88 AMLR ground fish survey of South Georgia I., Antarctica. All fish were collected with a bottom trawl during the austral summer. Fifteen species of demersal fish (including those of commercial value) were collected. Similarity analysis was applied to the diet information to describe trophic relationships in the South Georgia community. The most abundant species of the South Georgia demersal fish community were classified into three groups based on summer diets. The largest group contained species heavily dependent on krill Euphausia superba, and included Champsocephalus gunnari and Notothenia rossii. The second group was comprised of piscivores. Three of the four members of this group (Dissostichus eleginoides, Chaenocephalus aceratus, and Pseudochaenichthys georgianus) are commercially valuable. The food of their prey often consisted of krill. The third group contained a loose association of species which feed on benthic organisms more than did other fish species in the community. Notothenia gibberifrons and Notothenia squamifrons were the important commercial species in this group. Krill was found to be the most important prey species to the fish in the South Georgia system. However, based on the analysis of diet overlap, competition appeared to be unimportant in this community during the austral summer. Selective reduction of populations within the fish community by fishing may have widespread repercussions. Many of the commercially valuable species feed on other fish species which in turn feed on krill or benthic organisms. The relatively simple but highly interconnected food web in the South Georgia system may have a lower potential for fish yield than previously thought.																	0090-0656					OCT	1991	89	4					643	654									WOS:A1991GU46000009

Myctophid Fish (Family Myctophidae) Are Central Consumers in the Food Web of the Scotia Sea (Southern Ocean)	FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE												Myctophids are the most abundant and diverse mesopelagic fishes in the Southern Ocean. They are a conduit of energy between primary consumers and higher marine predators, and between the surface layers and the mesopelagic depths. However, there remain major uncertainties about their ecology, particularly regarding their role in Southern Ocean food webs in waters south of the Antarctic Polar Front, which are often regarded as dominated by Antarctic krill. Limited data on the feeding ecology of myctophids has made it difficult to assess the importance of myctophids as consumers of krill and how they fit in the traditional view of a krill-dominated system (diatom-krill-higher predator). We provide a new assessment of the role of myctophids in Southern Ocean food webs using information from recent trophodynamic studies of myctophids conducted in the Scotia Sea, one of the most productive regions of the Southern Oce an and a region that sustains both major populations of higher predators (sea birds, seals, whales) and important commercial fisheries (krill, toothfish, and mackerel icefish). Collectively, these data show that myctophids have a central role in Southern Ocean food webs as both predators and prey. Large myctophid species are prevalent consumers of krill throughout their distributional range and in different seasons in the Scotia Sea. Moreover, best estimates of both myctophid and higher predator consumption of krill to date indicate that large myctophids are the greatest predators of krill in this region, consuming almost as much krill as do all other vertebrates. Nevertheless, there are several smaller myctophid species that do not eat krill, instead consuming copepods and other small euphausiids. Myctophids therefore link primary producers to higher predators through both krill-dependent and krill-independent trophic pathways, emphasizing their importance in regional food webs. Consequently, trophic pathways involving large myctophids are unlikely to be exempt from the direct consequences of projected redistribution and/or reduction in krill population biomass under scenarios of ocean-warming, whilst trophic pathways involving small myctophids may be more resilient to such effects and become increasingly important to higher trophic levels. Further studies are required to determine the extent to which myctophids can maintain food web stability and sustain higher predator populations during periods of prolonged reductions in krill abundance. Including knowledge of the role of myctophids in Southern Ocean food webs will be important for developing robust projections of the impacts of future change to inform decision making for conservation and management.

PCNs, found in most of the samples, ranged from 1.5 pg/g in krill to 2550 pg/g in South polar skua on a wet weight basis. Lower chlorinated PCNs were the predominant congeners in organisms except skua and polar bear that showed similar PCN homologue patterns. PCDD/F concentrations were <90 pg/g wet wt in polar organisms; PCDD congeners showed peculiar accumulation patterns in different organisms. Correlation existed between PCN and PCB concentrations. PCB, HCB, and p,p'DDE levels were the highest in skua liver (11150 ng/g wet wt, 345 ng/g wet wt, and 300 ng/g wet wt, respectively). Contribution of PCNs to 2,3,7,8-tetrachlrodibenzo-p-dioxin equivalents (TEQ) was negligible (<0.1%) because of the lack of most toxic congeners. The highest TEQ was found in South polar skua liver (45 pg/g, wet weight). This is the first study to document the occurrence of PCNs in Antarctic organisms. High levels of dioxin-like chemicals in skua suggest the importance of intake via diet and migration habits, thus POP detection can be useful to trace migration behavior. Moreover, POP concentrations in penguin and skua eggs prove their transfer from the mother to eggs.

This basin is warming very rapidly, with species expected to shift northwards following their thermal tolerances. Here we show, however, that there has been a 50% decline in surface krill abundance over the last 60 years that occurred in situ, with no associated range shift. While we relate these changes to the warming climate, our study is the first to document an in situ squeeze on living space within this system. The warmer isotherms are shifting measurably northwards but cooler isotherms have remained relatively static, stalled by the subpolar fronts in the NW Atlantic. Consequently the two temperatures defining the core of krill distribution (7-13 degrees C) were 8 degrees of latitude apart 60 years ago but are presently only 4 degrees apart. Over the 60 year period the core latitudinal distribution of euphausiids has remained relatively stable so a 'habitat squeeze', with loss of 4 degrees of latitude in living space, could explain the decline in krill. This highlights that, as the temperature warms, not all species can track isotherms and shift northward at the same rate with both losers and winners emerging under the 'Atlantification' of the sub-Arctic. Martin Edwards et al. use data spanning from 1958-2017 from the Continuous Plankton Recorder Survey of the North Atlantic Ocean to examine krill distribution and abundance in conjunction with sea surface temperatures and show a 50% decline in surface krill abundance with no associated range shift. These data show that where the northern and southern distributions were previously separated by 8 degrees of latitude, they are now separated by 4 degrees, indicating a warming-induced range constriction.				; Goberville, Eric/A-2621-2017	Edwards, Martin/0000-0002-5716-4714; Goberville, Eric/0000-0002-1843-7855; Tarling, Geraint/0000-0002-3753-5899													2399-3642				MAY 31	2021	4	1							644	10.1038/s42003-021-02159-1							WOS:000659123600004	34059795					
J	HOSIE, GW				HOSIE, GW			DISTRIBUTION AND ABUNDANCE OF EUPHAUSIID LARVAE IN THE PRYDZ BAY REGION, ANTARCTICA	ANTARCTIC SCIENCE												In January 1985 a net sampling survey was carried out on the distribution and abundance of euphausiid larvae in the Prydz Bay region. Euphausia superba occurred in low abundance, probably due to sampling preceding the main spawning period. Thysanoessa macrura occurred thorughout the study area in consistently high abundance. Euphausia crystallorophias was marginally more abundant within its restricted range. Distinct north-south variations in larval age and developmental stages of T. macrura were observed indicating regional differences in spawning. Euphausia frigida was mainly confined to the upper 200 m of the antarctic Circumpolar Current. E. superba larvae produced north of the shelf break, between 70-degrees-83-degrees-E, moved north-east into the Antarctic Circumpolar Current. Larvae originating on the shelf moved rapidly west in the East Wind drift. E. crystallorophias has the same westward dispersion, but some larvae appeared to return eastward via the Prydz Bay Gyre and remain in the region. The data indicate that most E. superba larvae, providing they survive injurious cold temperature and food deprivation, will leave the area, suggests that Prydz Bay krill may not be a self maintaining stock.																	0954-1020					JUN	1991	3	2					167	180		10.1017/S0954102091000202							WOS:A1991FR41900005

Intermolt period (IMP) was derived from the molting rate method in order to estimate the DGRs. Mean IMP was 9.2 +/- 4.8 days (range: 2.9-18.7 d). Overall mean DGR was 0.03 +/- 0.13 mm d(-1). DGR showed a dome-shaped pattern, with a higher mean DGR when upwelling was moderate (0.06 +/- 0.04 mm d(-1)) than intense (0.01 +/- 0.00 mm d(-1)) or weak (0.01 +/- 0.01 mm d(-1)). This dome-shaped trend was observed in chlorophyll-a concentrations (Chla) at similar upwelling regimens. E. mucronata DGR variability was best explained by a generalized linear model which included the contribution of the Equatorial Subsurface Water, temperature, dissolved oxygen and Chla as predictor variables. Results suggest that E. mucronata is better adapted to grow under upwelling conditions when it can take advantage of high biological productivity, although the species growth is not limited when weak upwelling or even downwelling occurs. Analysis of the duration of the upwelling events suggest that E. mucronata growth is limited (shrinking) when upwellings last >10 days. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Geographical variation in the behaviour of a central place forager: Antarctic fur seals foraging in contrasting environments	MARINE BIOLOGY												Foragers show adaptive responses to changes within their environment, and such behavioural plasticity can be a significant driving force in speciation. We investigated how lactating Antarctic fur seals, Arctocephalus gazella, adapt their foraging within two contrasting ecosystems. Location and diving data were collected concurrently, between December 2003 and February 2004, from 43 seals at Bird Island, where krill, Euphausia superba, are the main prey, and 39 at Heard Island, where mostly fish are consumed. Seals at Heard Island were shorter and lighter than those at Bird Island and they spent longer at sea, dived more frequently and spent more time in the bottom phase of dives. Generalized additive mixed effects models showed that diving behaviours differed between the islands. Both populations exploited diel vertically migrating prey species but, on average, Heard Island seals dived deeper and exceeded their estimated aerobic dive limits. We propose that the recovery of the Heard Island population may be limited by the relative inaccessibility and scarcity of food, whereas at Bird Island, the presence of abundant krill resources helps sustain extremely high numbers of seals, even with increased intra- and inter-specific competition. Both populations of fur seals appear to be constrained by their physiological limits, in terms of their optimal diving behaviour. However, there does appear to be some flexibility in strategy at the level of trip with animals adjusting their time at sea and foraging effort, in order to maximize the rate of delivery of energy to their pups.

The relative GER (% of meal fed day(-1)) was also affected differently by fish and ration mass depending on the relative ration level being fed; at rations of 0.7% wet fish mass or above the relative GER decreased with increasing fish or ration mass (in such a way that the absolute GER remained constant and unaffected by fish mass). At maintenance (0.3% wet fish mass) rations the relative GER was not affected by fish size or ration mass. Thus, there appears to be a ration threshold above which the digestion physiology alters. Mass-specific GER (% g fish(-1) day(-1)) decreased with increasing fish mass. Within a set relative ration level (% wet fish mass) an increase in fish mass decreased the mass-specific GER. At a fixed ration mass, an increase in fish mass (i.e. a reduction in the ration expressed as % fish mass) resulted in a decrease in mass-specific GER. Gut evaluation time (GET) decreased and absorption efficiency (A) increased with increasing absolute GER. The effect of ration and fish mass on the absolute and relative GER followed the same pattern irrespective of the diet, however the A and GER (% day(-1) and g day(-1)) were higher and the GET shorter when the fish were fed shelled krill rather than amphipods.

MaxEnt is founded on the bedrock of probability theory and allows the most efficient possible use of known data in the inference process. The method takes explicit account of spatial correlation in the observed data and seeks to reconstruct a distribution of density across the whole survey area that is both consistent with the observed data and for which the entropy is maximized. The method is iterative and uses the Bayesian approach of evaluating the posterior probability of a candidate solution under the constraint of the observed data to progress towards a converged solution. We apply the method to reconstruct maps of the distribution of Antarctic krill throughout areas 100 x 80 km. Survey data were integrated at 0.5-km intervals along ten 80-km transects, giving approximately 1600 observed data points. We inferred the krill density for all 32 000 0.5 x 0.5 km cells in the area. The method is demanding computationally, but appears to work well even in cases when the distribution of density is highly skewed. The MaxEnt technique has proved to be powerful for reconstructing quantitative images from incomplete and noisy physical data (e.g. radio-telescope data): we suggest that it has utility in biological systems too and could be of benefit to the fisheries-acoustics community, increasing the accuracy of acoustic estimates of stock density and generating better maps of stock distribution.

J	Agnew, DJ				Agnew, DJ			The CCAMLR ecosystem monitoring programme	ANTARCTIC SCIENCE												The Convention on the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources states as part of its objective the maintenance of ecological relationships and the prevention of irreversible changes to the ecosystem. The Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR) has implemented an Ecosystem Monitoring Programme (CEMP) for the Antarctic marine environment to give effect to this requirement. The design phase of the programme took three years. The programme has been fully implemented since 1987 and involves monitoring selected predator, prey and environmental indicators of ecosystem performance. The central aim of the programme is the detection of changes in these indicators and the interpretation as to whether these changes are due to natural events or the harvesting of marine living resources. The core of the programme is the acquisition, centralised storage and analysis of standardised monitoring data combined with a strong emphasis on empirical and modelling based research. This both modifies the monitoring approach in line with changing requirements and creates a sound scientific background against which to test the effects of management options on components of the Antarctic ecosystem. The development of procedures for translating monitoring results into management advice is a critical part of the programme. Management takes the form of the regulation of fishing activities. Since 1987 CEMP has collected data on six bird and seal species at 15 sites around the Antarctic.

J	Cuzin-Roudy, J; Buchholz, F				Cuzin-Roudy, J; Buchholz, F			Ovarian development and spawning in relation to the moult cycle in Northern krill, Meganyctiphanes norvegica (Crustacea : Euphausiacea), along a climatic gradient	MARINE BIOLOGY												Adaptive processes linked to reproduction were studied comparatively for three populations of Northern krill, Meganyctiphanes norvegica (M. Sars, 1857), sampled during winter and summer cruises in the Clyde Sea (W Scotland), the Kattegat (E Denmark), and the Ligurian Sea (NW Mediterranean). The aim was to investigate the functional relationship between egg production and moulting under contrasted climatic and environmental conditions. A staging system for female sexual development established for live krill was complemented by a histological study of the ovary at various developmental steps. During the reproductive season, all adult female krill were engaged in cyclical egg production. During experiments, female krill released one batch of mature oocytes in one or two spawning events. The ovary of postspawn female krill still contained developing oocytes for another egg batch. In the non-reproductive period, all female krill had a resting ovary. Ovarian structure and pattern of egg production were identical in the three populations, but seasonal timing of egg production was different. The model proposed for the Ligurian population of the annual cycle of ovarian development can be extended to the other two populations, taking into account the seasonal characteristics of each site. Random field samples were staged simultaneously for moult cycle and for sexual development. Moult stages and the seasonal variation of the intermoult period were studied for the Kattegat population using multi-year data and compared to data obtained during summer/winter cruises in the Clyde and the Ligurian Sea. At the three sites, intermoult period was shorter and temperature-dependent during the reproductive period, concurrent with the season of greatest food availability. During most of the year and the period of sexual rest, moulting activity was reduced. The relationship between spawning and the moult cycle was studied comparatively for the three populations. Eggs were released during the premoult phase of a "spawning moult cycle", in one or two spawnings associated with apolysis and Moult Stage D1, respectively. Yolk accumulation for the next egg batch was completed during an alternating "vitellogenic moult cycle". A model for the timing of cyclical egg production in relation to moulting, as proposed for the Kattegat, can be extended to the other populations, taking into account intermoult period variation with temperature. Temperature appeared to be the principal environmental factor controlling growth (through moulting) and egg production during the reproductive season, in connection with favourable trophic conditions.																	0025-3162					MAR	1999	133	2					267	281		10.1007/s002270050466							WOS:000079269700011

Effects of chronic crude oil exposure on early developmental stages of the Northern krill (Meganyctiphanes norvegica)	JOURNAL OF TOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH-PART A-CURRENT ISSUES												Rising oil and gas activities in northern high latitudes have led to an increased risk of petroleum pollution in these ecosystems. Further, seasonal high UV radiation at high latitudes may elevate photo-enhanced toxicity of petroleum pollution to marine organisms. Zooplanktons are a key ecological component of northern ecosystems; therefore, it is important to assess their sensitivity to potential pollutants of oil and gas activity. As ontogenetic development may be particularly sensitive, the aim of this study was to examine the impact of chronic exposure to oil water dispersion (OWD) on development and feeding of early life stages of the Northern krill, Meganyctiphanes norvegica. In a range of experiments, embryonic, nonfeeding, and feeding larval stages were exposed to concentrations of between 0.01 and 0.1 mg/L of oil or photo-modified oil for 19 and 21 d. No significant effects on egg respiration, hatching success, development, length and larval survival were observed from these treatments. Similarly, evolution of fatty acid composition patterns during ontogenetic development was unaffected. The results indicates a high degree of resilience of these early developmental stages to such types and concentrations of pollutants. However, feeding and motility in later calyptopis-stage larvae were significantly impaired at exposure of 0.1 mg/L oil. Data indicate that feeding larval stage of krill was more sensitive to OWD than early nonfeeding life stages. This might be attributed to the narcotic effects of oil pollutants, their direct ingestion, or accumulated adverse effects over early development.				moodley, leon/AAH-1674-2019	Moodley, Leon/0000-0002-0617-3514; Bechmann, Renee Katrin/0000-0002-7113-4386												1528-7394	1087-2620					2017	80	16-18					916	931		10.1080/15287394.2017.1352204							WOS:000416346600010	28849995					
J	Salomon, M; Saborowski, R				Salomon, M; Saborowski, R			Tissue-specific distribution of pyruvate kinase isoforms improve the physiological plasticity of Northern krill, Meganyctiphanes norvegica	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY												The Northern krill, Meganyctiphanes norvegica (Crustacea, Euphausiacea) is widely distributed in the northern and northeastern parts of the Atlantic Ocean where it faces rapid variations in water temperatures and food. We studied the physiological potential of krill to compensate for environmentally induced metabolic changes. Two isoforms of the glycolytic key enzyme pyruvate kinase (PKI and PKII, EC 2.7.1.40) were partly purified from M norvegica by anion exchange chromatography. Specific activities and catalytic properties of each isoform were determined in whole body extracts as well as in selected organs and tissues of males and females. Both PK-isoenzymes differed slightly in their temperature profiles, their activation energy and their molecular weights. PKI showed a high affinity for the substrate PEP and was not affected by fructose-1.6-bisphosphate (FBP). In contrast, PKII showed low affinity for PEP but was strongly activated by FBP, up to 40-fold. The specific PK-activity of whole organisms was lower in females (44.9 +/- 4.8 U center dot g(ww)(-1)) than in males (61.3 +/- 7.7 U center dot g(ww)(-1)). In females PK II represented 20% of the total PK-activity while it was only 10% in males. Highest PK activities were present in the hearts, the eyes, pleopods and in the thoracopods. In the stomachs and the midgut glands PK activities were low. Almost all organs contained PKI and PKII However, PKI prevailed in the abdomens, the pleopods, the thoracopods, and in the thoracic muscles. PKII dominated in the eyes, the midgut glands and in the ovaries. Experiments showed that the tissue concentrations of FBP increased with food uptake and temperature. The expression of two PK-isoforms with different kinetic properties and the mediation of substrate affinity by FPB is a powerful tool to immediately regulate glycolytic energy flows in different organs. The krill is capable of adjusting energy consumption to changes in nutritional conditions as well as variations of environmental temperatures. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Diet variability and reproductive performance of macaroni penguins Eudyptes chrysolophus at Bird Island, South Georgia	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												We analysed summer diet and fledging mass of macaroni penguins Eudyptes chrysolophus breeding at Bird Island, South Georgia, during the creche period (January and February) between 1989 and 2010. Crustaceans were the main prey accounting, for over 90% of the diet by mass. Antarctic krill Euphausia superba was the main prey, in 17 out of 22 years. Amphipods Themisto gaudichaudii were the main prey in 1994 and 2009, fish in 2004, and the euphausiids Thysanoessa spp. and Euphausia frigida in 2000. There was no clearly dominant prey group in 1999. Prey diversity and the frequency occurrence of T. gaudichaudii both increased with a decreasing proportion of E. superba in the diet. There was strong evidence that macaroni penguins have a sigmoidal functional response, indicating that this kind of response should be accounted for when devising ecosystem-based management reference points for seabirds. The energy and mass of all euphausiids combined (rather than E. superba in particular) in the diet were the most reliable predictors of chick fledging mass; the correlation between model-predicted and observed values was 0.84. The gross energy content of individual meals was often above average in years when the diets contained fewer euphausiids, but fledging mass was always below average in these years. Although macaroni penguins are able to feed on a variety of prey types, chick growth was always severely impacted by a shortage of euphausiids due to higher energy or time costs associated with feeding on alternative prey types. Given their reliance on euphausiids, macaroni penguins would be particularly vulnerable to potential climate-driven declines in krill stocks.

J	ICHII, T; KATO, H				ICHII, T; KATO, H			FOOD AND DAILY FOOD-CONSUMPTION OF SOUTHERN MINKE WHALES IN THE ANTARCTIC	POLAR BIOLOGY												The stomach contents of 273 southern minke whales (Balaenoptera acutorostrata) taken in the region 55-degrees-S to the ice-edge and between 105-degrees-E and 115-degrees-E by a Japanese survey during 1987/88 were examined. The minke whales' dominant feeding ground coincided with a distinctive hydrographic front in the vicinity of the ice-edge at the mouth of Vincennes Bay. Krill (Euphausia superba) were the dominant food species comprising 100% and 94% by weight of stomach contents in the ice-edge and offshore zones, respectively. In the offshore zone, minke whales tend to feed on E. superba rather than Thysanoessa macrura, which is found more frequently than the former in net samples. Total food consumption by minke whales per day was estimated to be 1170 t (22.1 kg/km2) and 596 t (2.0 kg/km2) in the ice-edge and offshore zones, respectively. Feeding activity peaked in the early morning in the ice-edge zone, whereas it occurred irregularly throughout the day in the offshore zone. Two size modes of krill (25-28 mm in body length (1 year-old) and 41-48 mm (3-4 year-old)) dominated the diet. Although the former was numerically more abundant, the latter dominated the diet by weight, suggesting that larger krill are more important food for minke whales. Observed spatial pattern of krill populations in the study region suggests that movement of the subsurface cold water mass tended to carry krill offshore from the ice-edge.																	0722-4060	1432-2056				DEC	1991	11	7					479	487									WOS:A1991GU47800008

The kidney showed the major potential for aerobic ATP-generating pathway and argininolytic capacity. High levels of CS and MDH activities indicated that renal tissue can be involved in activities that require a lot of energy such as excretion of metabolic end products, amino acids catabolism or even gluconeogenic activities related to inter-tissue metabolism. The fact that kidneys are the main site for arginase activity is very unusual for mollusks and could be related to the living habits of L. elliptica. Genetic expression of the L. elliptica renal arginase could be controlling the levels of l-arginine and forming urea in the excretory organ, which may not have its physiological functions directly affected by the seasonal retraction of its siphons. Compared to the bivalve Dreissena polymorpha, renal arginase of L. elliptica is more resistant to inhibition by copper and cadmium. This could be related to naturally high levels of these metals in the Antarctic marine environment and its bioaccumulation in the renal tissue of L. elliptica, as a probable advantage to its environmental adaptation. Different from other Antarctic animals that feed on Krill, the arginase of L. elliptica is much more sensitive to fluoride inhibition. However, diet composition of L. elliptica would be expected to be variable site to site and its high sensitivity to fluoride inhibition may be a matter of concern in areas near ornithogenic soils subjected to ice-melting processes.

Palmer LTER: Patterns of distribution of five dominant zooplankton species in the epipelagic zone west of the Antarctic Peninsula, 1993-2004	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY												Variability in the temporal-spatial distribution and abundance of zooplankton was documented each summer on the Palmer Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) grid west of the Antarctic Peninsula between Anvers and Adelaide Islands during a 12-yr time series. Oblique tows to 120 m with a 2 x 2 m fixed-frame net were made at about 50 stations each January/February between 1993 and 2004. The numerically dominant macro- and mesozooplanktonic species >2mm included three species of euphausiids (Euphausia superba, Antarctic krill; Thysano ssa macrura; Euphausia crystallorophias, ice krill), a shelled pteropod (Limacina helicina), and a salp (Salpa thompsoni). Life cycles, life spans, and habitat varied among these species. Abundance data from each year were allocated to 100 km by 20 km (alongshore by on/offshore) grid cells centered on cardinal transect lines and stations within the Palmer LTER grid. The long-term mean or climatology and means for each year were used to calculate annual anomalies across the grid. Principal components analysis (PCA) was used to analyze for patterns and trends in the temporal-spatial variability of the five species. Questions included whether there are groups of species with similar patterns, and whether population cycles, species interactions or seasonal sea-ice parameters were correlated with detected patterns. Patterns in the climatology were distinct, and matched those of physical parameters. Common features included higher abundance in the north than in the south, independent of the cross-shelf gradients, and cross-shelf gradients with higher abundance either inshore (E. crystallorophias) or offshore (S. thompsoni). Anomalies revealed either cycles in the population, as episodic recruitment in Antarctic krill, or changes in anomaly pattern between the first and second half of the sampling period. The 1998 year, which coincided with a rapid change from a negative to a positive phase in the SOI, emerged as a year with either significant anomalies or that marked a change in anomaly patterns for different species. PCA analysis showed that the pattern of cumulative variance with increasing number of modes was distinctly different for shorter-lived versus longer-lived species; the first mode accounted for nearly 50% of the variance in the shorter-lived species and less than 25% in the longer-lived species. This suggested that the mechanisms driving variability in the temporal-spatial distribution of the shorter-lived, more oceanic species were less complex and more direct than those for the longer-lived euphausiids. Evidence from both the anomaly plots and the trend analysis suggested that salps have been more consistently present across the shelf from 1999 to present, and that the range of L. helicina has been expanding. With shorter life spans, these two species can respond more quickly to the increasing heat content on the shelf in this region. The cross-correlation analysis illustrated the negative correlation between salps and ice retreat and the number of ice days, and the positive correlation between the presence of ice krill and the day of ice retreat. These results suggest that for these species, several environmental controls on distribution and abundance were linked to seasonal sea-ice dynamics. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Humpback whale migrations to Antarctic summer foraging grounds through the southwest Pacific Ocean	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS												Humpback whale (Megaptera novaeangliae) populations typically undertake seasonal migrations, spending winters in low latitude breeding grounds and summers foraging in high latitude feeding grounds. Until recently, a broad scale understanding of whale movement has been derived from whaling records, Discovery marks, photo identification and genetic analyses. However, with advances in satellite tagging technology and concurrent development of analytical methodologies we can now detail finer scale humpback whale movement, infer behavioural context and examine how these animals interact with their physical environment. Here we describe the temporal and spatial characteristics of migration along the east Australian seaboard and into the Southern Ocean by 30 humpback whales satellite tagged over three consecutive austral summers. We characterise the putative Antarctic feeding grounds and identify supplemental foraging within temperate, migratory corridors. We demonstrate that Antarctic foraging habitat is associated with the marginal ice zone, with key predictors of inferred foraging behaviour including distance from the ice edge, ice melt rate and variability in ice concentration two months prior to arrival. We discuss the highly variable ice season within the putative foraging habitat and the implications that this and other environmental factors may have on the continued strong recovery of this humpback whale population.

We combine satellite images and citizen science to model habitat suitability for crabeater seals (Lobodon carcinophaga) throughout the Weddell Sea. Location Weddell Sea, Antarctica. Methods High-resolution satellite images covering 18,219 km(2)of the Weddell Sea during crabeater seal breeding season (October-November) were hosted on the crowd-sourcing platform Tomnod (DigitalGlobe). Citizen scientists marked "maps" where seals were present/absent and these votes were compared with the votes of an experienced observer. Correction factors were used to correct votes to either a continuous probability of seal presence, or a binary seal presence/absence value. We modelled probability of seal presence using ensemble models of Random Forests (RF), Boosted Regression Trees (BRT) and Support Vector Machines (SVM), and used fitted Maxent models to model seal presence/absence data. Results Model predictive power was low (RF:R-2 = 0.076 +/- 0.002: BRT:R-2 = 0.086 +/- 0.0008; SVM:R-2 = 0.082 +/- 0.003) to average (Maxent: AUC = 0.71 +/- 0.004). Distance to the ice edge and bathymetry were the most important variables that influenced crabeater seal distribution. Main conclusions Crabeater seals were more likely to be present over abyssal water, which coincides with typical adult Antarctic krill habitat - crabeater seal preferred prey. Where ice concentrations were more variable, that is more accessible, crabeater seals were also more likely to occur. Results agreed with the known ecology of crabeaters seals and the abundance, distribution and ecology of Antarctic krill. We were able to survey the largest area ever surveyed in the Weddell Sea and provide a model to assist furthering policy around the proposed protected area.

In discussing the data, the prey-predator linkage between these species was taken into account. Sampling was carried out during the 1995/96 and 1999/00 Italian Antarctic Expeditions. Fifty four polychlorobiphenyls (PCBs) and p,p'-DDE and hexachlorobenzene (HCB) were quantified in stomach contents of penguins nesting at Edmonson Point (Victoria Land) and in whole specimens of silverfish and krill from the Ross Sea. Xenobiotic concentrations in organisms were low compared to data reported for many marine species of lower latitudes and ranged from 0.22 ng g(-1) wet wt p,p'-DDE in krill to 161 ng g(-1) wet wt PCBs in silverfish. Fingerprints and class of isomer patterns showed a predominance of low chlorinated PCBs, mainly in pelagic organisms. Average input of these POPs through the diet was also evaluated. Concentrations of the most toxic non-ortho PCBs, IUPAC nos 77 (3,3',4,4'), 126 (3,3',4,4',5) and 169 (3,3',4,4',5,5'), were 1.63 pg g(-1), 7.31 pg g(-1) and 0.23 pg g(-1) wet wt, respectively, in stomach content samples. Stomach contents had 0.037 pg g(-1) wet wt TEQ (Toxic Equivalents) of which penta-CB 126 accounted for most of the toxicity.				ademollo, nicoletta/AAY-4811-2020; Olmastroni, Silvia/G-6267-2018; Corsolini, Simonetta/B-9460-2012; Romeo, Teresa/AAA-1711-2020	Olmastroni, Silvia/0000-0002-9319-9914; Corsolini, Simonetta/0000-0002-9772-2362; Ademollo, nicoletta/0000-0002-1875-6530; Romeo, Teresa/0000-0001-8515-1964												0954-1020	1365-2079				JAN	2003	15	1					95	104		10.1017/S0954102003001093							WOS:000181701700012

Understanding patterns of specialization and niche segregation among Antarctic marine predators is of increased importance because of recent climate-driven reductions in a key prey species, Antarctic krill Euphausia superba. We examined the stomach contents and stable isotope values of sympatric chinstrap Pygoscelis antarctica and gentoo P. papua penguins across 5 breeding seasons at Cape Shirreff, Livingston Island, Antarctica. Our goal was to examine foraging niche segregation and the degree of specialization between species during the chick-rearing period. Dietary and isotopic foraging niches indicated consistent niche partitioning with higher krill consumption and greater use of offshore foraging habitats by chinstrap relative to gentoo penguins. While chinstrap penguin diets were dominated by krill with little variation, gentoo penguins exhibited broader dietary and isotopic niches with a higher degree of variation. There was little evidence that shifts in the availability of adult krill influenced penguin diets or foraging niches during our study, though the contrasting foraging strategies identified provide insight into the differing population trends observed between penguin species. The narrower foraging niche observed in declining chinstrap penguin populations indicates that they are likely highly sensitive to declines in the abundance of Antarctic krill. In contrast, the generalist niche exhibited by recently expanding gentoo penguin populations is likely better suited to the rapidly changing environmental conditions in the Antarctic Peninsula.

Marine bacterial, archaeal and eukaryotic diversity and community structure on the continental shelf of the western Antarctic Peninsula	AQUATIC MICROBIAL ECOLOGY												The classic view of polar ocean foodwebs emphasizes large predators sustained by energy and material flow through short, efficient diatom-krill-predator food chains. Bacterial activity is generally low in cold polar waters compared to that at lower latitudes. This view appears to be changing, with new studies of microbial foodwebs in Arctic and Antarctic oceans. We characterized bacterial, archaeal, and eukaryotic community diversity and composition from 2 depths (near surface and below the euphotic zone) at 4 sites, including the inshore and offshore, and north and south corners of a sampling grid along the western coast of the Antarctic Peninsula (WAP). We detected up to 2-fold higher richness in microbial eukaryotes at surface and deep inshore northern stations as compared to southern stations, but offshore northern and southern stations revealed either no trend or higher richness at depth in the south. In contrast, bacterial and archaeal richness showed no significant differences either inshore or offshore at northern versus southern extents, but did vary with depth. Archaea were virtually absent in summer surface waters, but were present in summer deep and winter surface samples. Overall, winter bacterial and archaeal assemblages most closely resembled summer sub-euphotic zone assemblages, reflecting well-established seasonal patterns of water column turnover and stratification that result in an isolated layer of 'winter water' below the euphotic zone. Inter-domain heterotroph-phototroph interactions were evident from network analysis. The WAP is among the most rapidly warming regions on earth. Our results provide a baseline against which future change in microbial communities may be assessed.																	0948-3055	1616-1564					2014	73	2					107	121		10.3354/ame01703							WOS:000343594000002

Throughout the survey area, Salpa thompsoni accounted for > 95% of the total salp stock while Ihlea racovitzai was consistently represented in very low abundances. Maximum densities of S. thompsoni, with approximate to 4000 ind. 1000 m(-3), were recorded in the Marginal Ice Zone (MIZ) in December when chlorophyll-a concentrations were well below 1 mg m(-3). A dramatic decrease in salp stock was observed at the beginning of January, when S. thompsoni virtually disappeared from the most productive area of the MIZ where chlorophyll-a concentrations had by then reached bloom levels of 1.5-3 mg (Chl-a) m(-3). In situ grazing measurements showed that throughout the cruise S. thompsoni exhibited the highest ingestion rates per individual of any of the most abundant components of the grazing pelagic community, with maxima of approximate to 160 mu g (pigm) ind.(-1) d(-1). These feeding rates are 3 to 5 times higher than those previously obtained using in vitro incubations. The total daily consumption of the population of S. thompsoni varied from 0.3 to 108% of daily primary production. We suggest that competitive removal of food by S. thompsoni, rather than direct predation, is responsible for the low krill abundances generally associated with salp swarms.																	0924-7963					NOV	1998	17	1-4					361	374		10.1016/S0924-7963(98)00049-9							WOS:000077463500025

Large-scale climate and local weather drive interannual variability in Adelie penguin chick fledging mass	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												The fledging mass of penguin chicks can be an indicator of food availability and environmental conditions at a penguin colony. For the period 1989 to 2011, we analyzed predictor variables of environmental and food resource factors acting on multiple spatial scales near Palmer Station, Antarctica, that may influence the interannual variability in Adelie penguin chick fledging mass (CFM). To understand the influence of parental Adelie penguin diet on CFM, we modeled the energy density and krill demographics of penguin diet samples. We found a weak but significant positive relationship between the proportion of immature krill in adult penguin diets and CFM, which may indicate that krill recruitment and prey availability to adults influences CFM. However, the impact of large-scale climate and local weather outweighed the impact of parental diet characteristics on CFM. CFM was negatively associated with a positive Antarctic Oscillation (or Southern Annular Mode) and increased westerly winds and was positively associated with increased air temperature. The mechanistic relationship between climate, local weather, and CFM could include direct and indirect impacts, such as increased thermo-regulative costs for unattended chicks, decreased chick feeding frequency, and smaller meal mass for chicks driven by the geophysical transport of krill by climate and wind events.

This affects the ocean productivity which consecutively impacts plankton communities and polar top predators like penguins. Yet, the underlying behavioural and physiological mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here we monitored the ecophysiological responses of Adelie penguin (Pygoscelis adeliae) pairs during two seasons of contrasting timing of sea-ice retreat. Beside classical breeding parameters like foraging trip duration, body mass and reproductive success, we also investigated food-related stress (via plasma corticosterone concentration), nutritional state (via metabolite levels) and the use of penguins' habitat (via blood isotopic values). Body mass and reproductive success remained unchanged but foraging trips were shorter when sea-ice retreated earlier. Constant plasma corticosterone concentrations indicated that none of the feeding conditions resulted in a food-related stress. However metabolite levels were lower when sea-ice retreated early, suggesting that the foraging performance and the quality/quantity of food differed. Indeed isotopic ratios indicated that coastal prey like fish contributed more to the penguins' diet when sea-ice retreated prematurely. The early sea-ice retreat was related to higher chlorophyll concentrations, known to favour krill recruitment. Paradoxically, this was not associated to a higher krill contribution in the penguins' diet. We propose that a shift in the phytoplankton quality (rather than quantity), affecting krill recruitment, forced penguins to switch to more available prey like coastal fish. In some Antarctic regions, sea-ice is retreating earlier and earlier. In the present study, even though the timing of sea-ice retreat and the consecutive ocean productivity differed drastically between the 2 years, Adelie penguins were not severely affected because they were able to adjust their at-sea behaviour and thus maintained their body condition and reproductive success unchanged. This suggests that the timing of sea-ice retreat does not represent an important threat to populations of Adelie penguins at least as long as alternative resources are still available and other environmental parameters like winter sea-ice extent are not dramatically altered.

(C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.The foraging behaviour of Adelie penguins Pygoscelis adeliae was studied simultaneously at Shirley Island (SI, 110 degrees E) and at Petrel Island (PI, 140 degrees E) in approximate conjunction with the ship-based krill survey conducted on board the RSV Aurora Australis. Acoustic and trawl data were collected near both study sites, albeit at the end of the penguins' breeding season. The distances travelled by Adelie penguins from Shirley Island were significantly greater than those travelled by penguins from Petrel Island (SI 31-144km; PI 6-79km). Mean foraging trip durations and mean maximal distances travelled were also significantly different between colonies (duration: SI guard 55 +/- 32 h, creche 113 +/- 17 h; PI guard 32 +/- 9 h, creche 25 +/- 7 h; distance: SI guard 182 +/- 135km, creche 353 +/- 93km; PI guard 100 +/- 142km, creche 86 +/- 28 km). All penguins foraged over the continental shelf or the shelf break and not in oceanic waters. The percentage distribution of dive depths was similar at both colonies; nearly 70% of all dives were to <35 m. Trawls from the ship contained krill Euphausia superba and E. crystallorophias near SI but only E. superba near PI. Biomass measurements showed that near SI 61% of krill biomass occurred at 63-97 m but the penguins dived to this depth range only 12% of their time; near PI 83% of the biomass was found from 43 to 63 m and 20% of dives reached these depths. The diet of the SI penguins consisted mainly of E. crystallorophias 51-53% by mass), while penguins from PI ingested large amounts of both euphausiids (27-38% E. superba, 27-39% E. crystallorophias). At SI, the remainder of the diet consisted of fish, mainly Pleuragramma antarcticum (26-30%), and amphipods ( ( 1%). Similarly, at PI, fishcontributed 19-37% to the penguins' diet and amphipods constituted 1-3%. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Reid, K; Sims, M; White, RW; Gillon, KW				Reid, K; Sims, M; White, RW; Gillon, KW			Spatial distribution of predator/prey interactions in the Scotia Sea: implications for measuring predator/fisheries overlap	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY												The measurement of spatial overlap between predators and fisheries exploiting a common prey source is dependent upon the measurement scale used; inappropriate scales may produce misleading results. Previous assessments of the level of overlap between predators and fisheries for Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) in the region of the South Shetland Islands used different measurement scales and arrived at contradictory conclusions. At-sea data from observations of krill predators during the CCAMLR 2000 Survey were used to identify the areas of potential overlap with fisheries in the Scotia Sea and to determine the scale at which such overlap should be measured. The relationship between autocorrelation and sampling distance was used to identify the characteristic scales of the distribution of predators, krill and krill fisheries, and an effort-corrected index of relative abundance as a function of distance from land was used to identify the characteristics of areas of high potential for overlap. Despite distinct differences in foraging ecology, a group of krill-dependent species including chinstrap penguin (Pygoscelis antarctica), (Antarctic) fur seal (Arctocephalus sp. (gazella)) and white-chinned petrel (Procellaria aequinoctialis) showed similar patterns of distribution; the relative abundances were highest at 60-120 km from land and decreased sharply at distances greater than 150 km from land. There were more inter-specific differences in the characteristic scales, which were of the order of 50-100 km. Antarctic krill had a characteristic scale of approximately 200 km and the relationship with distance from land showed a log-linear decline. Krill fisheries operate at a scale of 150 km and occur almost entirely within 100 km of land. The requirement of land for breeding and the biological and oceanographic conditions that produce the high concentrations of krill associated with those land areas produce a system in which the demand for Antarctic krill from fisheries and predators is essentially co-extensive. The areas of greatest potential overlap are within 150-200 km of land and to accommodate the scales of operation of the processes involved the extent of such overlap in these areas should be assessed at scales of 70-100 km.

The krill was homogenized with NaClaq (final conc. 4%) and then diluted to 10 times (v/v) to obtain recovered protein. Intense autolysis including myosin heavy chain (MHC) degradation in the recovered protein was observed at the dehydration step and it was effectively suppressed in the presence of serine protease inhibitors such as 50 mmol/kg Benzamidine, 1.0 mg/g SBTI or 5 mmol/kg PMSF. The thermal gel-forming ability of the recovered krill protein was enhanced by using these serine protease inhibitors when heated at 40, 60 and 90 degrees C. Additionally, the gel-forming ability was significantly (p < 0.05) improved by using a mix of serine protease inhibitors (mixture of benzamidine, SBTI and PMSF) compared to single inhibitors. These results suggest that serine proteases involve proteolysis during the krill protein recovery process and the gel forming ability of the recovered protein can be improved by using serine protease inhibitors.

Two breeding species: southern elephant seals Mirounga leonina (Linnaeus, 1758) and Weddell seals Leptonychotes weddellii (Lesson, 1826), were present throughout the year, Three other species: crabeater seals Lobodon carcinophagus (Hobron and Jacquinot, 1842), leopard seals Hydrurga leptonyx (Blainville, 1820), and Antarctic fur seals Arctocephalus gazella (Peters, 1875) visited the area only for short periods. During this study, the abundance of elephant seals was stable, whereas those of Weddell and crabeater seals declined. Leopard seals numbers fluctuated irregularly. We detected a possible immigration from South Georgia: of a stable magnitude for elephant seals, and of variable magnitude, depending on food accessibility, for Antarctic fur seals. We found a strong recurrence of the spatial distributions of elephant, Weddell, and Antarctic fur seals in the 13 oases on the shore of Admiralty Bay. Annual distribution patterns were characteristic for each species. The innermost beaches were used predominantly by the animals during their annual fasts: the breeding and the moulting seasons.																	0001-7051					DEC	2002	47	4					443	457		10.1007/BF03192469							WOS:000180049800007

One of these communities is dominated by the Antarctic krill Euphausia superba. This community was located mainly along the continental shelf edge, usually between the offshore main oceanic community dominated by copepods and chaetognaths, and the neritic community dominated by E. crystallorophias. In January to March 1991, the Prydz Bay continental shelf area was the subject of a more intensive mesoscale survey to more accurately define the distribution patterns of the 3 zooplankton communities in that area. Cluster analysis and non-metric multidimensional scaling were used to define the communities, their distribution patterns, indicator species and species affinities. The composition of the communities were much the same as previously defined. E. superba again exhibited a distinct dissociation from all other species. However, the distribution pattern of the krill-dominated community was different from those previously observed. That community did not separate the copepod- and E. crystallorophias-dominated communities in Prydz Bay and apparently was displaced to the west. Temperature was strongly correlated with the zooplankton community distribution patterns, suggesting that temperature has more influence at the mesoscale level than at larger scales. Sea ice patterns, chlorophyll a abundance and salinity were also correlated, to a lesser extent, with the community distribution patterns.																	0171-8630					MAR	1994	106	1-2					21	39		10.3354/meps106021							WOS:A1994NB76600003

The phylogenetic position of one order within this class, the Euphausiacea ("krill," subclass Eumalacostraca) was investigated using 28S rDNA sequences from representatives of several malacostracan orders. Phylogenies for these sequences were estimated by maximum-likelihood and maximum-parsimony analysis. The results of these analyses produced a new scheme for evolution within the Eumalacostraca. The new phylogenies suggested that Euphausiacea are most closely related to the Mysida and not the Decapoda, as is generally thought. Furthermore, the Mysida were found not to be closely related to the Lophogastrida, which are often considered their sister taxon. These hypotheses were tested against the hypotheses of monophyly for the Eucarida, Mysidacea, and Peracarida and found to be significantly better on the basis of the 28S rDNA data.

Egg size, mass and incubation period remained constant. Laying, hatching and fledging were significantly delayed and less synchronous in 1991/92 (range of laying dates 51 days compared to 10-15 days in the two other seasons). This was due to an unusually cold and protracted winter, with ice blocking burrows into the spring, restricting availability of nest sites. Brooding lasted longer in 1991/92 but the overall fledging period was unchanged. Skeletal growth rates did not vary amongst years; growth in mass was slower in 1989/90 but fledging mass was similar in all three years. In 1989/90 and 1991/92 later hatched chicks grew (in mass) faster. The survival of chicks from hatching to fledging did not vary amongst years or with hatching date. Feeding frequency was similar between years, once allowance had been made for starlit nights. Thus late and asynchronous breeding in 1991/92 did not result in reduced breeding success either through predation or starvation. Crustaceans formed 98-99% of the mass of the identifiable portion of regurgitated food samples. Significant annual variation was found within these crustaceans with the presence of krill (least in 1990/91) being inversely related to that of amphipods and copepods. There was no relationship between diet composition and chick growth or survival. Other seabird species, lacking the morphological specialization for feeding on copepods and amphipods, had very low breeding success in 1990/91, when krill was scarce.																	0952-8369	1469-7998				SEP	1994	234		1				125	139		10.1111/j.1469-7998.1994.tb06060.x							WOS:A1994PQ35900009

Two types of bottom water are identified, Adelie Land Bottom Water, formed locally between 140 and 150 degrees E, and Ross Sea Bottom Water. Ross Sea Bottom Water is found only at 150 degrees E, whereas Adelie Land Bottom Water is found throughout the survey region. The bottom water mass properties become progressively warmer and saltier to the west, suggesting a westward flow. All of the eight meridional CTD sections show an Antarctic Slope Front of varying strength and position with respect to the shelf break. In the water formation areas (between 140 and 150"E) and 104 degrees E, the Antarctic Slope Front is more "V" shaped, while elsewhere it is one-sided. The shape of the slope front, and the presence or absence of water formation there, are consistent with other meridional sections in the Weddel Sea and simple theories of bottom-water formation Gill, 1973. Deep-Sea Research 20, 111-140; Whitworth et al., 1998. In: Jacobs and Weiss (Eds.), Ocean, Ice and Atmosphere: Interactions at the Antartic Continental Margin, Antarctic Research Series. American Geophysical Union, Washington, pp. (1 - 27). ADCP surface velocities and buoy drift tracks show a strong westward flow over the shelf and slope regions. In the region 90-100 degrees E there is a strong eastward flow of the waters just south of the Southern Boundary of the ACC, suggesting a recirculation of the westward slope current and the presence of a weak cyclonic gyre. Using the ADCP velocities as a reference for the CTD data, the average westward transport in this region is 29.4 +/- 14.7 Sv. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

Palatability and chemical anti-predatory defenses in common ascidians from the Antarctic Peninsula	AQUATIC BIOLOGY												Palatability of outer tissues of a suite (12 species) of Antarctic ascidians was evaluated using omnivorous fish and sea star predators. Tissues of 100% of those tested were unpalatable to fish, while 58% were unpalatable to sea stars. Lipophilic and hydrophilic extracts of 11 species were incorporated into pellets and tested in fish and sea star bioassays. Only the lipophilic extract from Distaplia colligans caused fish feeding deterrence. Organic extracts from 10 ascidian species were also examined in food pellet assays using an omnivorous amphipod. Only the lipophilic extract of D. cylindrica was a deterrent. Five of the ascidians possessed acidified outer tunics (pH < 3). We tested the ability of acidified krill pellets (pH 2 to 7) to deter fish and sea star predators and found that, while fish readily ingested acidified food pellets (pH 2), sea stars were deterred at pH 5 or less. Thus either organic or inorganic chemical defenses explain defense in 5 of the 7 ascidian species found unpalatable to sea stars. In contrast, chemical defenses only explain 1 of 12 species found unpalatable to fish, and only 1 of 10 ascidians tested against an amphipod predator. This predator-specific pattern of chemical defense may reflect greater predation pressure on ascidians from Antarctic sea stars. Alternatively, Antarctic ascidians may rely on other factors such as the toughness of their tunic or sequestration of heavy metals such as vanadium to inhibit feeding by Antarctic fish, a taxonomic group known to lack strong jaws.

The purified enzyme was identified as a trypsin by LC-ESI-MS/MS analysis. The relative molecular mass of TRY-EP was 33 kDa, with isoelectric point of 4.5. The histidine, tryptophan, arginine, lysine, aspartic acid and glutamic acid residues were functional groups to TRY-EP. TRY-EP was activated by Ca2+ and Mg2+ and inhibited by some heavy metal ions (Zn2+ Cu2+ Pb2+ and Hg2+) organic solvents (ethanol, glycerin, DMSO and acetone) and specific trypsin inhibitors (benzamidine, CEOM, SBTI and TLCK). TRY-EP was active over a wide pH (6.0-11.0) and temperature (10-70 degrees C) range, with optimum of pH 9.0 and 40-50 degrees C. TRY-EP was stable between pH 6.0 and 11.0 and below 30 degrees C. Compared with some trypsins from the Temperate and Tropical Zone organisms, TRY-EP and other trypsins from the Frigid Zone organisms have higher affinity to substrate and 2-42-fold physiological efficiency.																	1573-3149	1573-3904				JUN	2008	14	2					113	120		10.1007/s10989-007-9119-7							WOS:000255878700006

J	Barbosa, A; Palacios, MJ; Valera, F; Martinez, A				Barbosa, Andres; Jose Palacios, Ma.; Valera, Francisco; Martinez, Ana			Geographic variation in beak colouration in gentoo penguins Pygoscelis papua	POLAR BIOLOGY												Ornamental colouration is often due to carotenoid pigments and varies inter- and intra-specifically. This paper reports on variation in beak colour of the gentoo penguin, Pygoscelis papua, corresponding to different geographical locations along a latitudinal gradient in the Antarctic Peninsula (from King George Island (62A(0)15'S-58A(0)37'W) to Rong, Island (64A(0)40'S-62A(0)40'W). The gentoo penguin has a conspicuous red spot on both sides of the beak that indicates the presence of the carotenoid pigment, astaxanthin. Beak colouration was measured with a portable spectrophotometer for 20 individuals in three locations, along the Western coast of the Antarctic Peninsula. In the study area, marked variation can be found in terms of factors such us parasite load, human impact, variations in UV radiation and the abundance of krill; all possibly affecting carotenoid availability for signalling purposes. Colour traits were expected to be more intense, that is more vivid, saturated and pure, in places where there is diminished pressure from factors such as contamination, parasites or diseases, all of which may reduce the availability of carotenoids for other functions, such as antioxidant or immune stimulation involving physiological trade-offs. Likewise, colour traits might be predicted to be more intense where carotenoid sources, krill in the case of gentoo penguins, are more available. However, contrary to this initial expectation, our results indicate that northerly penguins' populations, which are in the most polluted and parasitized areas, have more saturated beaks. An alternative hypothesis suggests that environmental constraints relating to the variation in abundance of krill may explain the geographical variation in colour expression found among gentoo penguins.

Comparing acoustic classification methods to estimate krill biomass in the Georges Bank region from 1999 to 2012	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY-METHODS												Krill are a critical component of northern-latitude ecosystems, yet are poorly monitored in the Gulf of Maine and Georges Bank regions of the northeast United States continental shelf. We applied five acoustic classification methods (multifrequency single-beam index [MFSBI], dB-differencing, multifrequency index [MFI], and two variations of the Z-score method) to acoustic data collected during surveys conducted annually in the Georges Bank region in order to map krill spatial distribution from 1999 to 2012. Material properties (sound speed and mass density) of krill and length data from net samples collected in the Gulf of Maine and Georges Bank regions were used in conjunction with distorted wave Born approximation (DWBA) predicted target strengths to scale acoustic data to estimates of biomass for the Georges Bank region. All methods require a priori information, ranging from training sets (i.e., empirically based classification) to validated acoustic models of target strength (i.e., theoretically based classification) for the species and acoustic frequencies of interest. Incorporating predicted backscatter from theoretical models can improve confidence in classification, especially when clean training sets are not available, but does come at the cost of a validated acoustic backscatter model. The biomass estimates from the four acoustic classification methods were comparable among each other, with the MFSBI method consistently estimating lowest biomass and the empirically based Z-score consistently estimating highest biomass. Comparisons to net-based estimates were inconsistent, most likely due to net inefficiency (low catchability), targeting of layers, and scaling point estimates to regions.																	1541-5856					OCT	2018	16	10					680	695		10.1002/lom3.10275							WOS:000447207700006

Long-term variability in the diet and reproductive performance of penguins at Bird Island, South Georgia	MARINE BIOLOGY												Inter-annual variability in diet during crsche ( December to February) over 22 years ( 1989-2010) was examined for gentoo penguins Pygoscelis papua breeding at Bird Island, South Georgia ( 54 degrees 00 ' S, 38 degrees 03 degrees W). Overall, diets comprised 51% crustaceans and 49% fish by mass. Crustaceans were present in 89% of samples and were the main prey (> 50% by mass) in 10 years of the study. Antarctic krill Euphausia superba were present in 85% of all diet samples. Fish were present in 79% of samples and were the main prey in 12 years, with Champsocephalus gunnari and Lepidonotothen larseni the most frequently recorded species, in 51 and 33% of samples, respectively. The energy or mass of krill in the diet was the most reliable predictor of breeding success (the number of chicks fledged per breeding pair); the correlation between model-predicted and observed values was 0.58. We compared annual patterns of gentoo penguin diet variability with those of macaroni penguins Eudyptes chrysolophus breeding at the same location. Our results suggest that the availability of krill is a key source of diet variability for both species, but their diets indicate that gentoo penguins are generalist predators (feeding on pelagic and bentho-pelagic prey), while macaroni penguins are krill specialists (feeding on pelagic prey).

The influence of warmer Atlantic water in Kongsfjorden was indicated by the findings of three additional euphausiid species of typically Atlantic origin, relative to the previous study 10 years ago. The predominant presence of Thysanoessa inermis in Hornsund suggested persisting cold conditions in this more southerly, but more Arctic influenced fjord. In this species, moult stage analysis showed that trophic effects can override temperature forcing. Histology and lipid analysis suggest that reproductive activity should be monitored as an indication of warming and possibly a shift in food web composition.

J	Kirkwood, R; Robertson, G				Kirkwood, R; Robertson, G			The foraging ecology of female Emperor Penguins in winter	ECOLOGICAL MONOGRAPHS												The foraging location, diving behavior, dietary composition, and feeding rates of female Emperor Penguins (Aptenodytes forsteri) from the Auster and Taylor Glacier colonies in Antarctica were investigated during the 1993 austral winter. The study was conducted between late May and early August, when male emperors remain at the colonies to incubate eggs and females forage at sea for self-maintenance. During winter, two satellite-tracked penguins from Auster foraged approximate to 100 km northeast of the colony in open water 200-500 m deep, over the outer continental shelf and shelf slope. Ten Auster and four Taylor Glacier penguins that carried time-depth recorders took approximate to 8 d to reach the ice edge, spent 50-60 d at sea foraging, and took 4 d to return across the fast ice to the colony. The females occasionally huddled together to minimize heat loss while in transit to the ice edge and between foraging days. The penguins foraged on 93.2% of their days at sea and rested for the remainder. On each foraging day, penguins usually entered the water just after dawn and averaged 4.71 h in the water before exiting at dusk. The hourly dive rate was constant throughout winter, but the daily dive rate increased as day length increased, suggesting that day length is a primary determinant of hunting effort. Penguins exhibited behavior indicative of foraging on 47% of their dives, the remainder being travel or search dives. Penguins made, on average, 26 foraging dives/d. Females from Auster targeted prey at water depths of 20-70 m and 100-150 m, whereas Taylor Glacier birds targeted prey at 10-70 m, 250-300 m, and 330-400 m, suggesting between-colony differences in prey distribution. The stomach contents of 17 females returning to Auster to brood their chicks were dominated by pelagic prey species: Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba, 70% by mass) and Antarctic silverfish (Pleuragramma antarcticum, 13% by mass). Food consumption rates during winter for five penguins from both colonies were similar and averaged 62.6 +/- 5.8 g.kg(-1).d(-1) (1.8 +/- 0.1 kg/d for a 28.8 kg female), which equated to a metabolizable energy intake of 236.6 +/- 22.0 kJ/kg for each day they foraged (all, values are mean +/- 1 SD). This enabled the birds to gain approximate to 6.1 kg for a trip spanning approximate to 70 d. Based on mean prey masses and the penguins' dive rates, the penguins consumed approximate to 115 x 0.6 g krill or 16 x 4.3 g Antarctic silverfish per foraging dive, or some combination of both. In their winter trip, each breeding female consumed approximate to 100 bg of prey. The female populations at Auster and Taylor Glacier consumed an estimated 1350 Mg and 250 Mg of prey, respectively, in winter.																	0012-9615	1557-7015				MAY	1997	67	2					155	176		10.1890/0012-9615(1997)067[0155:TFEOFE]2.0.CO;2							WOS:A1997WX48100002

Information on AMW densities in the sea ice-covered parts of the Southern Ocean is required to contextualize abundance estimates obtained from circumpolar shipboard surveys in open waters, suggesting a 30% decline in AMW abundance. Conventional line-transect shipboard surveys for density estimation are impossible in ice-covered regions, therefore we used icebreaker-supported helicopter surveys to obtain information on AMW densities along gradients of 0%-100% of ice concentration. We conducted five helicopter surveys in the Southern Ocean, between 2006 and 2013. Distance sampling data, satellite-derived sea-ice data, and bathymetric parameters were used in generalized additive models (GAMs) to produce predictions on how the density of AMWs varied over space and time, and with environmental covariates. Ice concentration, distance to the ice edge and distance from the shelf break were found to describe the distribution of AMWs. Highest densities were predicted at the ice edge and through to medium ice concentrations. Medium densities were found up to 500 km into the ice edge in all concentrations of ice. Very low numbers of AMWs were found in the ice-free waters of the West Antarctic Peninsula (WAP). A consistent relationship between AMW distribution and sea ice concentration weakens the support for the hypothesis that varying numbers of AMWs in ice-covered waters were responsible for observed changes in estimated abundance. The potential decline in AMW abundance stresses the need for conservation measures and further studies into the AMW population status. Very low numbers of AMWs recorded in the ice-free waters along the WAP support the hypothesis that this species is strongly dependent on sea ice and that forecasted sea ice changes have the potential of heavily impacting AMWs.

Daily rations measured with gut fluorescence varied from 2.2 to 2.7% in surface C. acutus. Weight-specific respiration and excretion rates in deep C. acutus decreased by a factor of 11 and 3.5-3.8 compared to their surface counterparts. High lipid (up to 455 mug ind-1) and protein (198 mug ind-1) content was observed in surface C. acutus CV in February; a month later the animals with similar lipid and protein content were found in the depth (500-1000 m layer). Their lipid reserves were enough to overwinter and probably to ascend, molt and reproduce. At the same time some of the deep CVs had much lower protein and lipid content and could survive only for 4-5 months. Our own and literature data led to the conclusion that females of C. acutus reach adulthood at the age of more than one year while development of males could be completed in one year.

Here we present experimental evidence that Procellariiform seabirds can use a naturally occurring scented compound, dimethyl sulphide, as an orientation cue, Dimethyl sulphide has been studied intensely for its role in regulating global climate(8-11) and is produced by phytoplankton in response to zooplankton grazing(12). Zooplankton, including Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba)(13), are in turn eaten by seabirds and other animals(14). Results from controlled behavioural experiments performed at sea show that many Procellariiforms can detect dimethyl sulphide, and that some species (for example, storm petrels) are highly attracted to it. To our knowledge, this constitutes the first evidence that dimethyl sulphide is part of the natural olfactory landscape overlying the southern oceans.																	0028-0836					AUG 24	1995	376	6542					680	682		10.1038/376680ao							WOS:A1995RQ67200058

Such conditions would normally lead to low productivity and a water column dominated by recycling processes involving microbial components of pelagic communities but this does not seem to be the case in the Southern Ocean, where there is efficient export to large apex predators and deep waters. This paper investigates the role of large microphagous zooplankton (salps, krill, and some large copepods) in the partitioning of biogenic carbon among the pools of short- and long-lived organic carbon and sequestered biogenic carbon. Large microphagous zooplankton are able to ingest microbial-sized particles and thus repackage small, non-sinking particles into both metazoan biomass and large, rapidly sinking faeces. Given the wide spatio-temporal extent of microbial trophic pathways in the Southern Ocean, large zooplankton that are omnivorous or able to ingest small food particles have a competitive advantage over herbivorous zooplankton. Krill efficiently transfer carbon to a wide array of apex predators and their faecal pellets are exported to depth during occasional brief sedimentation episodes in spring time. Salps may be a significant link towards some fish (directly) and other apex predators (indirectly) and, at some locations (especially in offshore waters) and time, they may account for most of the downward flux of biogenic carbon. Large copepods are a trophic link towards fish and at least one whale species, and their grazing activity generally impedes the export of organic particles to depth. As a result, biogenic carbon is channelled mainly towards apex predators and episodically into the deep ocean. Without these original interactions, Antarctic waters might well be dominated by microbial components and recycling processes instead of active export from the generally small primary producers towards large apex predators.																	0924-7963					NOV	1998	17	1-4					325	345		10.1016/S0924-7963(98)00047-5							WOS:000077463500023

The collection of diet samples on three occasions over a 2-week period was compared with collecting all samples during a single session, as current CCAMLR Ecosystem Monitoring Programme protocols recommend. Some differences in the mass of food recovered from penguins were found but this was attributed to the mass of penguin sampled. There were no differences in diet composition between protocols and although body mass was a significant determinant of the mean length of krill Euphausia superba recovered from penguins, there were no differences between sampling protocols. This study has shown that; differences between sampling frequencies are small and a variety of sampling protocols can produce results acceptable for inter-annual monitoring. The mass of sampled individuals can account for significant variation and should be recorded, especially if sampling frequencies and sizes are low.																	0722-4060					SEP	1999	22	3					156	163		10.1007/s003000050405							WOS:000082423000002

The circulation and water masses of the Antarctic shelf and continental slope between 30 and 80 degrees E	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY												The circulation and water masses from the Antarctic continental shelf to 62 degrees S between 30 and 80 E are described using hydrographic data collected on seven hydrographic sections during the Baseline Research on Oceanography, Krill and the Environment-West (BROKE-West) experiment. The eastern limb of the Weddell Gyre dominates circulation between 30 and 40 degrees E, and is significantly cooler and fresher than the region to the east. The Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) extends from the north into the survey region east of 40 degrees E, reaching as far south as 65.5 degrees S at 60 degrees E. This results in increasing observed maximum temperature and salinities progressively towards the east, peaking at 80 degrees E due to the intrusion of the southern ACC Front (sACCF) to 63 degrees S. This southward extension is steered by the southern end of Kerguelen Plateau, causing a horizontal shear of over 0.15 m s(-1) between the eastward ACC and westward-flowing Antarctic Slope Current (ASC). The ASC is observed at all six meridional sections immediately north of the shelf break. It is strongly barotropic and transports a total of 15.8 +/- 7.4 Sv westwards, while the bottom referenced baroclinic component only contributes 1.3 +/- 0.3 Sv. At each section this current intensifies to a narrow westward 'jet' with absolute velocities up to 0.3 m s(-1) over the steepest shelf slope gradients. At 70 degrees E a 'V' shape is observed in the ASF. This, and the nearby presence of denser shelf water and ice-shelf water, is characteristic of Antarctic Bottom Water (AABW) formation, but no new AABW is found on this section. Instead, significantly warmer, saltier and less oxygenated AABW to the east and newly formed AABW high on the continental slope immediately to the west suggest a formation region just west of 70 degrees E. This newly formed AABW progressively becomes warmer and saltier west of 60 degrees E and is observed extending offshore and moving westward below eastward flowing water masses.

Modelling the effects of environmental conditions on the acoustic occurrence and behaviour of Antarctic blue whales	PLOS ONE												Harvested to perilously low numbers by commercial whaling during the past century, the large scale response of Antarctic blue whales Balaenoptera musculus intermedia to environmental variability is poorly understood. This study uses acoustic data collected from 586 sonobuoys deployed in the austral summers of 1997 through 2009, south of 38 degrees S, coupled with visual observations of blue whales during the IWC SOWER line-transect surveys. The characteristic Z-call and D-call of Antarctic blue whales were detected using an automated detection template and visual verification method. Using a random forest model, we showed the environmental preferences pattern, spatial occurrence and acoustic behaviour of Antarctic blue whales. Distance to the southern boundary of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (SBACC), latitude and distance from the nearest Antarctic shores were the main geographic predictors of blue whale call occurrence. Satellite-derived sea surface height, sea surface temperature, and productivity (chlorophyll-a) were the most important environmental predictors of blue whale call occurrence. Call rates of D-calls were strongly predicted by the location of the SBACC, latitude and visually detected number of whales in an area while call rates of Z-call were predicted by the SBACC, latitude and longitude. Satellite-derived sea surface height, wind stress, wind direction, water depth, sea surface temperatures, chlorophyll-a and wind speed were important environmental predictors of blue whale call rates in the Southern Ocean. Blue whale call occurrence and call rates varied significantly in response to inter-annual and long term variability of those environmental predictors. Our results identify the response of Antarctic blue whales to inter-annual variability in environmental conditions and highlighted potential suitable habitats for this population. Such emerging knowledge about the acoustic behaviour, environmental and habitat preferences of Antarctic blue whales is important in improving the management and conservation of this highly depleted species.

J	Burri, L				Burri, Lena			The power of omega-3 phospholipids Omega-3 fatty acids from Superba (TM) krill oil show increased bioavailability compared to triglyceride omega-3s	AGRO FOOD INDUSTRY HI-TECH												Many health-promoting benefits have been associated with the intake of the omega-3 fatty acids, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). As a dietary supplement, Superba (TM) krill oil provides these important fatty acids to a large part in the form of phospholipids. Due to the special combination of omega-3 phospholipids and the antioxidant astaxanthin, krill oil has been alleviated with numerous positive health effects. The intention of this article is to provide information on the influence of the structural form of omega-3 fatty acids (phospholipids from krill oil versus triglycerides from fish oil) on blood plasma levels of EPA and DHA. Two human clinical studies suggest that omega-3s provided in phospholipid form accumulate in higher amounts in plasma than when taken up in triglyceride form.																	1722-6996	2035-4606				MAR-APR	2011	22	2					10	+									WOS:000290971500004

Prey density and depth affect the fine-scale foraging behavior of humpback whales Megaptera novaeangliae in Sitka Sound, Alaska, USA	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												Humpback whales Megaptera novaeangliae are filter feeders that use discrete lunges to effectively capture densely aggregated prey. The objective of this research was to examine how foraging humpback whales in Southeast Alaska responded to varying prey patch densities and depths. Digital acoustic recording tags (DTAGs; n = 6) were deployed and focal follows were conducted on foraging whales in Sitka Sound, Alaska in September 2012. Prey density was recorded around tagged whales using a Simrad EK60 scientific echosounder and ground-truthed with net tows. Lunges were identified from peaks in jerk in the accelerometer signal, and krill were identified from echosounder data using decibel differencing. Lunge depth was 111 +/- 9 m (mean +/- SD) for the shallowest diving whale (foraging past sunset) and 144 +/- 7 (mean +/- SD) m for the deepest diving whale (foraging diurnally). Ninety-five percent of lunges occurred within a 300 m and 30 min spatio-temporal buffer of krill, indicating that tagged whales fed on krill. Generalized additive mixed model (GAMM) results for spatio-temporally integrated prey and lunge data indicated that mean volume backscattering strength, a proxy for krill density, and krill depth significantly affected the occurrence of a lunge (density: p = 0.006, depth: p < 0.001). Whales fed in the densest region of the krill layer, where mean volume backscatter was -57 dB (range: -50 to -81 dB re 1 m(-1) at 120 kHz). By targeting the densest prey layer, whales maximized their energetic gain by capturing the most prey with each lunge.

J	Trebilco, R; Melbourne-Thomas, J; Constable, AJ				Trebilco, Rowan; Melbourne-Thomas, Jess; Constable, Andrew John			The policy relevance of Southern Ocean food web structure: Implications of food web change for fisheries, conservation and carbon sequestration	MARINE POLICY												Southern Ocean food webs provide ecosystem services with significant global value including carbon sequestration, fisheries and the existence of iconic wildlife. These services are underpinned by different energetic pathways including those dominated by Antarctic krill, fishes and squids, or gelatinous zooplankton (salps). Climate change is likely to impact Southern Ocean food webs by affecting their foundations - both primary producer communities and ice habitats. However, the implications of these changes for ecosystem services - including wildlife populations, fisheries and carbon sequestration - are unclear, as are the implications for policy and management. Here, we use a generalised representation of Southern Ocean food webs and qualitative network modelling to investigate the consequences of five simple but plausible scenarios of future change for ecosystem services and the conservation of important taxa: (i) a shift in primary producer communities with decreasing large diatoms and increasing small flagellates; (ii) increasing salps; (iii) increase (recovery) of the Great whales; and unregulated and unsustainable fisheries for (iv) krill or (v) toothfish. Strikingly, our results suggest that increases in salps might not have negative consequences for ecosystem services and could enhance carbon export potential. Simulated increases in unregulated krill and toothfish fisheries affect predatory wildlife and could also reduce carbon export potential. Our results emphasise the important policy implications of understanding the structure and change of whole food webs, and highlight that improved quantitative understanding and modelling of the relative importance of different energy pathways will be important for developing robust management responses to climate change impacts.

Based on both historical and these recent results, a series of regional-scale acoustic surveys was initiated in the northwestern Gulf and estuary to quantify the spatial and temporal variations in the regional abundance, distribution and aggregation of northern and Arctic krill. By using a recently-developed multi-frequency method to classify these two krill species, our study re-evaluated the species-specific krill distribution and abundance, previously monitored by plankton-net sampling alone. We show that Thysanoessa raschii is the more coastal species, with its center-of-mass in the shelf and slope habitats. Meganyctiphanes norvegica forms generally less dense aggregations in the slope and channel habitats. Biomass in the northwestern Gulf and estuary was split 60:40 between T. raschii and M. norvegica, and totaled 1.0 million tonnes in August 2009; substantially more than has been reported previously. This re-evaluation should have considerable impact on ecosystem models which have assumed much lower values for these important forage populations. The pattern of krill aggregations identified from large- and regional-scale surveys will have important implications for the interpretation of critical habitat for endangered marine mammals which depend on krill.

Effects of variability in prey abundance on reproduction and foraging in chinstrap penguins (Pygoscelis antarctica)	JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY												Life-history theory predicts that adults of long-lived species such as seabirds should optimally balance investment in current and future offspring. However, when trying to optimize investment in offspring provisioning, the most energetically costly component of seabird parental care, adults need to contend with large interannual fluctuations in prey availability and hence the cost of chick provisioning. Adults faced with this uncertainty can mechanistically balance parental care by adopting a strategy somewhere along the continuum between maintaining constant investment in foraging effort between years and letting chick provisioning fluctuate or holding chick provisioning constant and varying investment in foraging effort. Using ship-based hydroacoustic assessment of prey, time-depth recorders attached to penguins and land-based observations at the breeding colony, we examined how foraging and reproductive effort in breeding chinstrap penguins Pygoscelis antarctica responded to interannual variation in the abundance of Antarctic krill Euphausia superba in the vicinity of Seal Island, South Shetland Islands, 1990-1992. Regional measures of krill density varied by a factor of 2.5 (47.0, 23.8 and 61.2 g m(-2) in 1990, 1991 and 1992, respectively) and was correlated with annual measures of breeding adult body weight and reproductive performance (breeding population size, duration of chick rearing, chick growth, breeding success and fledgling weight). In contrast, measures of penguin foraging effort (dive depth, dive duration, number of trips day(-1), trip duration, number of dives trip(-1) and dive rate) did not differ between years. We conclude that chinstrap penguins reduce reproductive success rather than increase foraging effort in response to decreases in prey abundance in a manner consistent with predictions of life-history strategies for long-lived seabirds.

Here we review both the management and current status of Antarctic baleen whales and consider those threats likely to impact on them. Threats range from global problems - marine pollution and climate change - to localized issues including shipping, habitat disturbance, unregulated wildlife tourism and fishery activities. We identify the most pressing anthropogenic threats to baleen whales including scientific whaling and climate change. It is unclear whether current management approaches will be able to effectively encompass all these threats while also accounting both for the differing levels of scientific understanding and for the differing recovery rates of the whale species. For management we recommend the following: 1) incorporation of both ecosystem considerations and the suite of identified threats not limited to direct take, 2) identification of measurable indicators of changes in whales that allow more certainty in monitoring of populations and the environment, and 3) recognition of significant relationships between baleen whales and habitat features to provide information on distribution and use.

Microplastics and other anthropogenic particles in Antarctica: Using penguins as biological samplers	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Microplastics (< 5 mm in size) are known to be widespread in the marine environment but are still poorly studied in Polar Regions, particularly in the Antarctic. As penguins have a wide distribution around Antarctica, three congeneric species: Adelie (Pygoscelis adeliae), chinstrap (Pygoscelis antarcticus) and gentoo penguins (Pygoscelis papua) were selected to evaluate the occurrence of microplastics across the Antarctic Peninsula and Scotia Sea. Scat samples (used as a proxy of ingestion), were collected from breeding colonies over seven seasons between 2006 and 2016. Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba), present in scat samples, contributed 85%, 66% and 54% of the diet in terms of frequency of occurrence to the diet of Adelie, gentoo and chinstrap penguins, respectively. Microplastics were found in 15%, 28% and 29% scats of Adelie, chinstrap and gentoo penguin respectively. A total of 92 particles were extracted from the scats (n = 317) and 32% (n = 29) were chemically identified via micro-Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (mu-FTIR). From all the particles extracted, 35% were identified as microplastics, particularly polyethylene (80%) and polyester (10%). It was not possible to ascertain the identification of the remaining 10% of samples. Other anthropogenic particles were identified in 55% of samples, identified as cellulose fibres. The results show a similar frequency of occurrence of particles across all colonies, suggesting there is no particular point source for microplastic pollution in the Scotia Sea. Additionally, no clear temporal variation in the number of microplastics in penguins was observed. Overall, this study reveals the presence of microplastics across Antarctica, in three penguin species and offers evidence of other anthropogenic particles in high numbers. Further research is needed to better understand the spatio-temporal dynamics, fate and effect of microplastics on these ecosystems, and improve plastic pollution policies in Antarctica.

Therefore, we review some examples of exploited fishery stocks in which environmental control is a major contributor to structuring the abundance and distribution of the stock. Four examples, taken from studies of northern cod (Gadus morhua), cod and haddock (Melanogrammus aeglefinus) larvae, the eastern oyster (Crassostrea virginica), and Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba), are given that clearly illustrate environmental control on the fishery. From these examples, we argue that future management strategies for exploited fisheries must include effects of environmental variability. In particular, management strategies must be flexible enough to include delayed responses to environmental variations that result from the transfer of perturbations from larger to smaller scales and vice versa. This capability requires an understanding of where linkages between the physical environment and the species of interest occur. Development of this knowledge requires input from a variety of disciplines, coordinated research programs, and considerable cooperation at national and international levels.																	1051-0761					FEB	1998	8	1		S			S23	S32		10.1890/1051-0761(1998)8[S23:EVEOMF]2.0.CO;2							WOS:000072166600004						
J	Bengtson, JL; Stewart, BS				Bengtson, JL; Stewart, BS			Diving patterns of a Ross seal (Ommatophoca rossii) near the eastern coast of the Antarctic Peninsula	POLAR BIOLOGY												In January 1987 we documented the diving patterns of a female Ross seal (Ommatophoca rossii) in the marginal pack-ice zone near the eastern coast of the Antarctic Peninsula for 2 days using a microprocessor-based time-depth recorder. The seal hauled out during the day and dived continually when in the water at night. Dives averaged 110 m deep and 6.4 min long; the deepest dive was 212 m and the longest 9.8 min. Dives were deepest near twilight and shallowest at night; this pattern suggests that the seal's prey, presumably midwater squid and fish, may have been making vertical migrations or changing predator-avoidance behavior in response to diel light patterns. The dives of this Ross seal were substantially deeper, on average, than those of crabeater seals (Lobodon carcinophagus), which forage in the same areas on Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba).																	0722-4060					SEP	1997	18	3					214	218		10.1007/s003000050178							WOS:A1997XR39800007

Whale distribution in relation to prey abundance and oceanographic processes in shelf waters of the Western Antarctic Peninsula	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												The Western Antarctic Peninsula (WAP) is a biologically rich area supporting large standing stocks of krill and top predators (including whales, seals and seabirds). Physical forcing greatly affects productivity, recruitment, survival and distribution of krill in this area. In turn, such interactions are likely to affect the distribution of baleen whales. The Southern Ocean GLOBEC research program aims to explore the relationships and interactions between the environment, krill and predators around Marguerite Bay (WAP) in autumn 2001 and 2002. Bathymetric and environmental variables including acoustic backscattering as an indicator of prey abundance were used to model whale distribution patterns. We used an iterative approach employing (1) classification and regression tree (CART) models to identify oceanographic and ecological variables contributing to variability in humpback Megaptera novaeangliae and minke Balaenoptera acutorstrata whale distribution, and (2) generalized additive models (GAMs) to elucidate functional ecological relationships between these variables and whale distribution. The CART models indicated that the cetacean distribution was tightly coupled with zooplankton acoustic volume backscatter in the upper (25 to 100 m), and middle (100 to 300 m) portions of the water column. Whale distribution was also related to distance from the ice edge and bathymetric slope. The GAMs indicated a persistent, strong, positive relationship between increasing zooplankton volume and whale relative abundance. Furthermore, there was a lower limit for averaged acoustic volume backscatter of zooplankton below which the relationship between whales and prey was not significant. The GAMs also supported an annual relationship between whale distribution, distance from the ice edge and bathymetric slope, suggesting that these are important features for aggregating prey. Our results demonstrate that during the 2 yr study, whales were consistently and predictably associated with the distribution of zooplankton. Thus, humpback and minke whales may be able to locate physical features and oceanographic processes that enhance prey aggregation.

J	Hyatt, J; Beardsley, RC; Owens, WB				Hyatt, Jason; Beardsley, Robert C.; Owens, W. Brechner			Characterization of sea ice cover, motion and dynamics in Marguerite Bay, Antarctic Peninsula	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY												As part of the U.S. GLOBEC Southern Ocean Program, data from two automatic weather stations (AWSs) on small islets and upward-looking acoustic Doppler current profilers (ADCPs) and an upward-looking sonar (ULS) on sub-surface moorings have been analyzed to produce time series of atmospheric forcing, sea ice thickness, sea ice and ocean velocities, and sea ice momentum balances within Marguerite Bay and at mid-shelf on the central west Antarctic Peninsula continental shelf for the austral winter-spring seasons of 2001 and 2002. Both years had roughly seven months of nearly complete sea ice cover, but ice onset was about two months earlier in 2002 than 2001 mostly due to extremely cold surface air temperatures in Marguerite Bay during May-June 2002. Sea ice draft was quite variable, but generally thickened with time, reaching similar to 2-3 m by the end of September before thinning. In October, 2002, a polynya was observed at one site within Marguerite Bay that lasted for 4 days. The sea ice motion and dynamics in Marguerite Bay were analyzed when sea ice draft was greater than 2 m. Wind stress during these periods was predominantly southward and southeastward. Wind stress, sea ice, and near-surface water motion were partially correlated, with sea ice motion greater than water motion. Large wind stress and sea ice and water motions occurred during short energetic events of a few days or shorter; however, the rms wind stress, sea ice, and water velocities were small, about 0.3 N m(-2), 8-16 cm s(-1), and 5-7 cm s(-1), respectively. Mean sea ice motion was southward, but quite small, of order 2 cm s(-1), while mean near-surface water motion was not statistically different from zero. The dominant sea ice momentum balance was between wind and internal ice stresses on time scales of several days and longer, with water stress, Coriolis, and tilt terms playing secondary roles. The mean southward wind stress was balanced, within uncertainty, by the mean northward internal ice stress. The strong and variable internal ice stresses were likely due to the onshore winds, the thickness of the sea ice, and the nearby coastline. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AARS enzymes catalyze the first step in protein synthesis while the IGR method is based on changes in body length during molting. Growth rates of field-collected krill were measured via the IGR method and individuals were subsequently preserved for AARS analysis to yield paired measurements. Our results show that conditions during the IGR incubation period influenced AARS activity in these individuals precluding a direct comparison but revealing the different timescales across which these two measures integrate. Importantly, they show that AARS activity provides a snap-shot image of an organism's metabolism, while IGR of krill is thought to integrate their environmental experience over several days. Each method would require repeated measurements to estimate population growth rates integrated over seasonal or generational time scales. As part of this project, we investigated how specific the AARS assay is to protein synthesis by testing a modified protocol that includes an additional blank and found evidence that the current assay may be measuring other cellular processes in addition to its intended signal. Our results suggest that a new NADH Blank might be optimized to improve the specificity of the assay.

Winter distribution and haul-out behaviour of female Antarctic fur seals from South Georgia	MARINE BIOLOGY												Telemetry-based techniques have revealed the foraging patterns of many land breeding marine predators, especially during the summer breeding season. However, during the winter, when freed from the constraints of provisioning their young, such animals are more difficult to track. Using geolocation (Global Location Sensing, GLS) loggers and satellite tags (Platform Terminal Transmitters, PTTs) we successfully tracked 16 female Antarctic fur seals from South Georgia during the austral winter. The majority of females concentrated their winter foraging in the waters around the breeding beaches (90% of locations were within 510 km). However, as the winter progressed, two of the seals spent a number of months to the south, in and around the seasonal ice edge, and five seals migrated north and northwest from South Georgia. Four of these seals clearly crossed the Polar Front and two reached the Patagonian Shelf, apparently exploiting the continental shelf edge and the Subantarctic Front. Activity (saltwater immersion) data suggested that seals spent the majority of the winter months at sea but there were rare occasions when seals hauled out, either on land or on ice floes. We obtained data from two individuals that enabled us to compare the performance of PTT and GLS devices. For these seals the mean distance between GLS and PTT locations was 122 and 132 km. Although the recovery rates were low in this study, given improvements in attachment techniques, we have demonstrated that these micro-geolocation loggers provide an ideal tool with which to study the long-term dispersal of diving marine predators at larger scales. This is the first study to show that female fur seals from South Georgia remain at sea for almost the entirety of the non-breeding winter period. Using land-based observations it has been assumed that the fur seal population at South Georgia has little temporal overlap with the krill fishery that operates mostly during the winter months in this region. We have shown that a large proportion of the female fur seals that breed on South Georgia potentially remain in the vicinity of the island and are thus in direct competition with the region's fisheries activities.

Persistent organic pollutants in benthic and pelagic organisms off Adelie Land, Antarctica	MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN												The concentrations of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB), hexachlorobenzene (HCB), pentachlorobenzene (PeCB) and polybrominated diphenylethers (PBDE) were described in benthic and pelagic species collected off Adelie Land, Antarctica. Strong differences were observed among species, with reduced PeCB and HCB levels in benthic species, and elevated PCB levels in the Antarctic yellowbelly rockcod, the Antarctic sea urchin and the snow petrel. Lower-chlorinated congeners were predominant in krill; penta-PCBs in benthic organisms; hexa- and hepta-PCBs in seabirds and cryopelagic fish. This segregation may result from sedimentation process, specific accumulation and excretion, and/or biotransformation processes. The presence of PBDEs in Antarctic coastal organisms may originate from atmospheric transport and partly from a contamination by local sources. Although POP levels in Antarctic marine organisms were substantially lower than in Arctic and temperate organisms, very little is known about their toxic effects on these cold-adapted species, with high degree of endemism.

In this study, the POP levels in the Antarctic biota samples were found to be ranked in the following order: OCPs > PAHs >> PBDEs. The POP levels in notothenioid fish and krill correlate to trophic levels; however, the POP concentrations in intertidal benthic invertebrates are higher than in notothenioid fish implying that specific biogeochemical factors may affect bioaccumulation in the Antarctica ecosystem. Biomagnification of POPs may have a smaller role than bioconcentration in Antarctica environment. In addition to the source, transport, exposure, and absorption for each group of POPs in the short food chain in Antarctica, the biological variation among species, interaction habitats, diet and metabolism are also factors for future studies on contaminant bioaccumulation.

J	KELLERMANN, A; SCHADWINKEL, S				KELLERMANN, A; SCHADWINKEL, S			WINTER ASPECTS OF THE ICHTHYOPLANKTON COMMUNITY IN ANTARCTIC PENINSULA WATERS	POLAR BIOLOGY												Ichthyoplankton was sampled from the Antarctic Peninsula area of the South Polar Ocean in early winter (May and June 1986). A total of 153 eggs from two species and 1368 larvae or juvenile stages from 12 species were obtained. These included pelagic species, and demersal species with a long pelagic larval or juvenile phase. Most abundant were larvae of Pleuragramma antarcticum and Notothenia kempi, and eggs of Notothenia neglecta. The distribution of notothenioid and paralepidid larvae was apparently unaffected by ice cover, whereas myctophid larvae were confined to ice-free waters. Areas where newly hatched Chionodraco hamatus occurred coincided with dense aggregations of Euphausia superba (Krill) furcilia larvae which is a potential food resource during winter. The hatching of icefish larvae during winter is apparently independent of the seasonal production cycle. Epipelagic eggs of Notothenia neglecta were found during the spawning season, which suggests that eggs ascend to the surface after demersal spawning and that development takes place near the sea surface during winter. Larvae of Notothenia kempi were chiefly confined to shelf and slope waters to the west of the Antarctic Peninsula, with larger larvae found in coastal shelf areas. Pleuragramma antarcticum occurred in the coastal waters off the Biscoe Islands, in the Gerlache Strait, and in the northern Bransfield Strait. The smallest larvae were found in the northern Bransfield Strait, whereas those at the Biscoe Islands and in Gerlache Strait waters were larger and of a similar size. A cyclonic gyre to the west of the Antarctic Peninsula observed in the austral summer was likely to have affected the larval drift of Pleuragramma antarcticum and Notothenia kempi. Differences in the timing of spawning and hatching and the vertical distribution of these larvae will lead to different transport and spatial distribution patterns. It is hypothesized that early winter conditions do not imply severe limitations on the year-class success of larval fish. Dispersal and increased mortality may occur during the second half of the winter.																	0722-4060					MAY	1991	11	2					117	127									WOS:A1991FN90600005

Sexual differentiation, gonad maturation, and reproduction of the Southern Ocean euphausiid Thysanoessa macrura (Sars, 1883) (Crustacea: Euphausiacea)	JOURNAL OF CRUSTACEAN BIOLOGY												Thysanoessa macrura (Sars, 1883) is a small, albeit highly abundant, Southern Ocean euphausiid. It has been reported that T. macrura reproduces during late winter, with the reproductive cycle decoupled from periods of high primary productivity in the highly seasonal Southern Ocean. Despite this uncommon reproductive strategy, there has been little work to describe this cycle and quantify the reproductive potential of this species. Thysanoessa macrura collected from Antarctic waters during early September to early October 2007 were used to establish sexual developmental stages, for females and males, to provide a standard means for assessing the reproductive maturity of this species. Seven sexual developmental stages were established for females based upon the organisation of ovaries and their constituent oogonia and oocytes. Four sexual developmental stages were identified in males using secondary sexual characters. A large lipid deposit was identified in the carapace of both sexes, reducing in size with progressive gonadal development, likely fuelling egg and sperm production. Egg-batch size was determined by direct ovarian counts and scaled allometrically with total wet weight. Predicted egg-batch size ranged from 34 to 746 eggs batch(-1) for the range of individual sizes studied (30.5-165.6 mg). Using the ratios of the different oocytes remaining after the first-spawning event of females, it was predicted that up to three egg batches can be produced by T. macrura in a single reproductive season. Consequently, the fecundity of T. macrura is estimated at 60 to > 2200 eggs female(-1) year(-1). A model of T. macrura reproductive cycle confirms a winter reproductive period and further highlights the reproductive potential of this small-size Southern Ocean euphausiid, providing the first estimates of fecundity reported for this species.

Cetacean distribution in relation to environmental parameters between Drake Passage and northern Antarctic Peninsula	POLAR BIOLOGY												The Drake Passage (DP) is a dynamic oceanographic region influenced by the main frontal systems of the Southern Ocean, with little information about cetacean distribution and their relationship with environmental parameters. This study explored the use of generalized additive models (GAMs) to model the relationships of some cetacean species according to sea surface temperature (SST) and a suite of physiographic variables adjacent to the Antarctic Peninsula and DP during the austral summer. The results suggest that SST and distances from oceanographic boundaries, mainly the Southern Antarctic Circumpolar Current Front (SACCF) and Polar Front (PF), were the most significant parameters related to the presence/absence of cetaceans. SST showed an effect on humpback whale (Megaptera novaeangliae) presence around lower temperatures and sei whale (Balaenoptera borealis) and hourglass dolphin (Lagenorhynchus cruciger) at warmer waters. Four species of baleen whales prefer areas near SACCF and Elephant Island and two odontocetes in waters near the PF. Clustering analysis reflected three major groupings based on distances from oceanic fronts and coast: cetaceans that occurred in the northern sector of the DP but with the PF as the southernmost range; a second group with species occurring along the DP and not preferring Antarctic waters further south of the SACCF; and the third group, mainly baleen whales, mostly occupying Antarctic waters southern of the SACCF. We encourage further dedicated cetacean surveys in this particular dynamic region, based on in situ oceanographic data and krill acoustic sampling, and either taking into consideration cetacean species density or abundance.

Ecosystem services in Antarctica: Global assessment of the current state, future challenges and managing opportunities	ECOSYSTEM SERVICES												Antarctic ecosystem services are rich and diverse and include global climate modulation, biodiversity and habitat protection, cultural heritage, scientific knowledge, education and recreation as well as the extraction of marine living resources. However, environmental protection studies have rarely examined the full complement of Antarctic values recognized in the Antarctic Treaty or Antarctica's other natural benefits as ecosystem services (ES). Moreover, the existing limited number of ES studies have focused primarily on the biophysical modeling of the service providing units, with little focus on evaluating the balance between Antarctica's intrinsic vs. economic values (e.g., opportunity cost, payment for services and bequest), or societal perceptions on the Antarctic ES teleconnections with global issues. Here, we systematically identify the ES dimensions present in Antarctica through an expert elicitation combined with scientific literature review. We then map their spatial overlap and examine the existing trends of usage over the various stages of ES utilization in the continent. Lastly, we conduct a preliminary evaluation of the resulting trade-offs from their respective increased utilization. Our results show that Antarcticas ES are currently facing substantial challenges to remain sustainable. In marine ecosystems, fish and krill stock provisioning may put at risk the maintenance of habitats and biodiversity regulation. In turn, cultural values centered around terrestrial ecosystems, face a three-way conflict between the increasing demand for tourism opportunities, the region's rich and diverse scientific interests and the vast wilderness and bequest values. To appropriately conserve Antarctic ES for future generations, we discuss how different ES framework tools could be developed and adapted to the Antarctic Treaty policy context.

The biochemical composition, energy content, and chemical antifeedant defenses of the common Antarctic Peninsular sea stars Granaster nutrix and Neosmilaster georgianus	POLAR BIOLOGY												The sea stars Granaster nutrix and Neosmilaster georgianus are conspicuous members of benthic communities along the Antarctic Peninsula. An analysis of the proximate composition of somatic body components of nonreproductive adults indicates the nutrient storage organs (pyloric caeca) are rich in both protein (60.7 and 60.6% mean dry wt, respectively) and lipid (25.4 and 29.8% mean dry wt, respectively). Body-wall tissues, while containing small inconspicuous skeletal ossicles, are also comprised of significant levels of organic matter (33.5 and 55.7% mean dry wt, respectively), attributable primarily to protein. Both the pyloric caeca and body-wall tissues are relatively rich in energy (mean energy levels=24.8 and 26.5 kJ g(-1)dry wt; 8.4 and 14.1 kJ g(-1) dry wt, respectively). Despite the availability of these nutrients and energy neither sea star is preyed upon by the sympatric omnivorous sea star Odontaster validus, a common predator of other Antarctic sea stars. Laboratory feeding bioassays indicate that O. validus rejects live intact individuals and body-wall tissues of both sea star species while readily consuming dried krill. Alginate food pellets containing a krill powder and tissue level concentrations of organic methanol extracts of body-wall tissues were also rejected by O. validus. Moreover, the copious mucus released from the body wall of N. georgianus was deterrent in O. validus food pellet bioassays. Thus, both sea stars evidently possess defensive secondary metabolites that defend against predation and are likely to play a role in mediating materials and energy transfer in the Antarctic benthos.

J	Rombola, E; Marschoff, E; Coria, N				Rombola, Emilce; Marschoff, Enrique; Coria, Nestor			Analysis of the sources of variance in the mean size of krill consumed by Chinstrap and Adelie penguins at South Orkney Islands	POLAR BIOLOGY												The CCAMLR Ecosystem Monitoring Program aims at detecting possible impacts of the krill fishery on predator populations. Population parameters of Chinstrap and Ad,lie penguins are monitored at Point Martin, Laurie Island, South Orkneys Islands as part of the Program. Diet information is collected to aid in the interpretation of population data. In the present study, the diet of both species is compared in order to detect differences between them as well as to ascertain whether the krill consumed by both species might be pooled in single estimates of prey parameters. A nested ANOVA model was fitted to the dataset obtained in the seasons from 1997/1998 to 2005/2006. The overall variance was decomposed into variance components: within penguins (krill in stomachs), between penguins (means within each date), between dates (date means in each season), and between years (annual means). The within penguins component was similar in both species (18 % difference), while the between penguins was 64 % larger in Adelies. The within and between penguins variance components of both species showed consistent interannual changes. The annual means of both species differed significantly in three seasons, but not consistently. The sources of variance are tentatively attributed to biological characteristics: the within penguins component would reflect searching and feeding at the individual level; the between penguins might be associated with their foraging ranges, an assumption to be tested tracking individuals. Given their differences, the information from both species should be viewed as complementary and not be pooled.																	0722-4060					OCT	2012	35	10					1601	1606		10.1007/s00300-012-1201-8							WOS:000308331600014

Antarctic ecosystems in transition - life between stresses and opportunities	BIOLOGICAL REVIEWS												Important findings from the second decade of the 21st century on the impact of environmental change on biological processes in the Antarctic were synthesised by 26 international experts. Ten key messages emerged that have stakeholder-relevance and/or a high impact for the scientific community. They address (i) altered biogeochemical cycles, (ii) ocean acidification, (iii) climate change hotspots, (iv) unexpected dynamism in seabed-dwelling populations, (v) spatial range shifts, (vi) adaptation and thermal resilience, (vii) sea ice related biological fluctuations, (viii) pollution, (ix) endangered terrestrial endemism and (x) the discovery of unknown habitats. Most Antarctic biotas are exposed to multiple stresses and considered vulnerable to environmental change due to narrow tolerance ranges, rapid change, projected circumpolar impacts, low potential for timely genetic adaptation, and migration barriers. Important ecosystem functions, such as primary production and energy transfer between trophic levels, have already changed, and biodiversity patterns have shifted. A confidence assessment of the degree of 'scientific understanding' revealed an intermediate level for most of the more detailed sub-messages, indicating that process-oriented research has been successful in the past decade. Additional efforts are necessary, however, to achieve the level of robustness in scientific knowledge that is required to inform protection measures of the unique Antarctic terrestrial and marine ecosystems, and their contributions to global biodiversity and ecosystem services.

J	McDaniel, JD; Emslie, SD				McDaniel, JD; Emslie, SD			Fluctuations in Adelie penguin prey size in the mid to late Holocene, northern Marguerite Bay, Antarctic Peninsula	POLAR BIOLOGY												We investigated temporal changes in Adelie penguin prey size in northern Marguerite Bay, Antarctic Peninsula, through excavations of three abandoned and one active colony at Lagoon (67degrees35'S, 68degrees16'W) and Ginger Islands (67degrees45'S, 68degrees41'W), respectively, in austral summer 1999/2000. Radiocarbon dates on penguin bones and eggshell fragments collected at each site indicate that Lagoon Island was first occupied after 6000 BP and Ginger Island near 2275 BP. Identifiable non-krill prey remains (otoliths and squid beaks) were recovered from ornithogenic soils at all sites, with Antarctic silverfish (Pleuragramma antarcticum) and squid (Psychroteuthis glacialis) being the most abundant species represented in the deposits. Estimated mean standard lengths and mantle lengths of these two prey taxa, based on regressions with otolith and beak measurements respectively, indicate that Adelie penguins primarily select these prey within a mean size range of 95-117 mm. Prey size also varied significantly across seven occupation periods from 6000 BP to the present, but did not correlate with climate change.																	0722-4060					AUG	2002	25	8					618	623		10.1007/s00300-002-0401-z							WOS:000177451600010

A total of 180 grower fish averaging 154.0 g in weight were chosen randomly and distributed into 12 flow-through tanks of 300 L (15 fish per tank). Four experimental diets were prepared in triplicate. Pollock meal (PM), anchovy meal (AM), krill meal (KM), and jack mackerel meal (JM) were used as the main protein source in the experimental diets, denoted PM, AM, KM, and JM diets, respectively. These diets were fed to fish twice a day at a satiation level for eight weeks. The weight gain and specific growth rate (SGR) of fish fed the KM and JM diets were higher than were those of fish fed the other diets. Daily feed intake (DFI) and daily protein intake (DPI) of fish fed the KM and JM diets were higher than were those of fish fed the PM and AM diets. The strong second polynomial correlation between the contents of 4 free amino acids (arginine, glutamic acid, histidine and leucine) in protein sources and WG, SGR, DFI and DPI were observed. The experimental diets had no effect on proximate composition of the muscle and liver. Plasma analysis did not differ between the experimental diets. In conclusion, KM and JM showed the greatest protein sources than among the ingredients assessed, and consequently KM and JM yielded the higher growth (WG and SGR) and feed intake (DFI and DPI).																	2352-5134					JUL	2020	17								100331	10.1016/j.aqrep.2020.100331							WOS:000544612200002

The slow settling fine particles showed a marked inter-annual variability in biochemical composition with an increase in lipid content as % organic carbon. Comparison of the fatty acid spectra of different size categories of organic particles indicated that fine particles are dominated by saturated, monoenoic and branched acids, while larger material (50-100 mu m, 200-500 mu m net collected fractions) displayed a signature dominated by polyunsaturated acids. Zooplankton taxa displayed different strategies of lipid accumulation. Lipid content was highest in Thysanoessa macrura females and copepodite stages of Calanus propinquus. Relatively low levels were recorded for juveniles and male stages of euphausiids. Reserve lipids varied with species: C. propinquus showed equal content of triglycerides and wax esters, T. macrura showed a dominance of wax esters and Euphausia superba and Themisto gaudichaudii accumulated only triglycerides. Computed as carbon equivalent and integrated over 200 m, lipids in slow settling particles represented 22.6% of annual primary production. Similar computation with mesozooplankton and E. superba data on biomass and population structure from several summer cruises indicated values of carbon accumulation as Lipid reserves and egg production of 4.2 and 0.1% of annual primary production for copepods and 4.4 and 3.8% for E. superba. When all trophic levels are considered, the overall mean exceeded 30% of annual primary production.																	0924-7963					NOV	1998	17	1-4					391	410		10.1016/S0924-7963(98)00051-7							WOS:000077463500027

We studied the effects of concentrates of phospholipids, sphingolipids, and/or 3-n fatty acids on the expression of genes or miRNAs related to synaptic activity and/or neurodegeneration, in the hippocampus of aged Wistar rats following a 3-month supplementation. The combination of two phospholipidic concentrates of krill oil (KOC) and buttermilk (BMFC) origin modulated the hippocampal expression of 119 miRNAs (11 were common to both BMFC and BMFC + KOC groups). miR-191a-5p and miR-29a-3p changed significantly only in the BMFC group, whereas miR-195-3p and miR-148a-5p did so only in the combined-supplemented group. Thirty-eight, 58, and 72 differentially expressed genes (DEG) were found in the groups supplemented with KOC, BMFC and BMFC + KOC, respectively. Interaction analysis unveiled networks of selected miRNAs with their potential target genes. DEG found in the KOC and BMFC groups were mainly involved in neuroactive processes, whereas they were associated with lysosomes and mRNA surveillance pathways in the BMFC + KOC group. We also report a significant reduction in hippocampal ceramide levels with BMFC + KOC. Our results encourage additional in-depth investigations regarding the potential beneficial effects of these compounds.				MARTIN-HERNANDEZ, ROBERTO/M-8161-2014; Carneiro, Joao T. E.

Seasonal acoustic occurrence, diel-vocalizing patterns and bioduck call-type composition of Antarctic minke whales off the west coast of South Africa and the Maud Rise, Antarctica	MARINE MAMMAL SCIENCE												Seasonal occurrence, diel-vocalizing patterns, and call-types of Antarctic minke whales are described using bio-acoustic recordings from the west coast of South Africa and the Maud Rise, Antarctica. In Antarctica, minke whale bioduck calls were detected in seven of nine months of hydrophone deployment (peaking in May and September) while downsweeps were only detected in June. Bioduck calls were sporadically detected in South African waters with peak calling in September/October, and no bioducks were detected from March through August. Bioduck call occurrence was high during daytime in Antarctica but there was no diel-vocalizing pattern in South African waters. We split bioduck B call-type into two subtypes: B1 with 13 +/- 1 pulses (Dominello & Sirovic, 2016) and B2 with 9 +/- 1 pulses (this study). Bioduck B2 was detected both in Antarctic and South African waters, with harmonics up to 2 kHz. Similar bioduck call-types were detected in Antarctic and South African waters, with bioduck A2 being the most common. Month of the year was the most important predictor of bioduck occurrence both in Antarctic and South African waters. This is the first study to describe the seasonal occurrence, diel-vocalizing behavior and call-types of Antarctic minke whales off the South African west coast and eastern Weddell Sea.

Modelling predation by transient leopard seals for an ecosystem-based management of Southern Ocean fisheries	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING												Correctly quantifying the impacts of rare apex marine predators is essential to ecosystem-based approaches to fisheries management, where harvesting must be sustainable for targeted species and their dependent predators. This requires modelling the uncertainty in such processes as predator life history, seasonal abundance and movement, size-based predation, energetic requirements, and prey vulnerability. We combined these uncertainties to evaluate the predatory impact of transient leopard seals on a community of mesopredators (seals and penguins) and their prey at South Georgia, and assess the implications for an ecosystem-based management. The mesopredators are highly dependent on Antarctic krill and icefish, which are targeted by regional fisheries. We used a state-space formulation to combine (1) a mark-recapture open-population model and individual identification data to assess seasonally variable leopard seal arrival and departure dates, numbers, and residency times; (2) a size-based bioenergetic model; and (3) a size-based prey choice model from a diet analysis. Our models indicated that prey choice and consumption reflected seasonal changes in leopard seal population size and structure, size-selective predation and prey vulnerability. A population of 104 (90-125) leopard seals, of which 64% were juveniles, consumed less than 2% of the Antarctic fur seal pup production of the area (50% of total ingested energy, IE), but ca. 12-16% of the local gentoo penguin population (20% IE). Antarctic krill (28% IE) were the only observed food of leopard seal pups and supplemented the diet of older individuals. Direct impacts on krill and fish were negligible, but the "escapement" due to leopard seal predation on fur seal pups and penguins could be significant for the mackerel icefish fishery at South Georgia. These results suggest that: (1) rare apex predators like leopard seals may control, and may depend on, populations of mesopredators dependent on prey species targeted by fisheries: and (2) predatory impacts and community control may vary throughout the predator's geographic range, and differ across ecosystems and management areas, depending on the seasonal abundance of the prey and the predator's dispersal movements. This understanding is important to integrate the predator needs as natural mortality of its prey in models to set prey catch limits for fisheries. Reliable estimates of the variability of these needs are essential for a precautionary interpretation in the context of an ecosystem-based management. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Effect of one year krill oil supplementation on depressive symptoms and self-esteem of Dutch adolescents: A randomized controlled trial	PROSTAGLANDINS LEUKOTRIENES AND ESSENTIAL FATTY ACIDS												Introduction: Observational studies have shown a relationship between omega-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 LCPUFA) and depression in adolescents. However, n-3 LCPUFA supplementation studies investigating the potential improvement in depressive feelings in adolescents from the general population are missing. Methods: A one-year double-blind, randomized, placebo controlled krill oil supplementation trial was conducted in two cohorts. Cohort I started with 400 mg eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) or placebo, after three months this increased to 800 mg EPA and DHA per day, whilst cohort II started with this higher dose. Omega-3 Index (O3I) was monitored via finger-prick blood measurements. At baseline, six and 12 months participants completed the Centre for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) and the Rosenberg Self Esteem questionnaire (RSE). Adjusted mixed models were run with treatment allocation/O3I as predictor of CES-D and RSE scores. Results: Both intention-to-treat and assessing the change in O3I analyses did not show significant effects on CES-D or RSE scores. Conclusion: There is no evidence for less depressive feelings, or higher self-esteem after one year of krill oil supplementation. However, due to a lack of adherence and drop-out issues, these results should be interpreted with caution.																	0952-3278	1532-2823				DEC	2020	163								102208	10.1016/j.plefa.2020.102208							WOS:000598497900008	33232912

ANTARCTIC RADIOCARBON RESERVOIR: THE CASE OF THE MUMMIFIED CRABEATER SEALS (LOBODON CARCINOPHAGA) IN BODMAN CAPE, SEYMOUR ISLAND, ANTARCTICA	RADIOCARBON												At least 50% of the world's seal population is distributed in the pack-ice region surrounding Antarctica. Among the Antarctic seals, Lobodon carcinophaga (commonly known as "crabeater seals") are the most abundant. This is a krill-feeding species, subsisting primarily on Euphausia superba. The occurrence of mummified seals has been documented since 1900 in several Antarctic regions, and different hypotheses about age and what happened to them have been proposed. Taking into account the depletion of C-14 concentration in marine waters, we dated a recently deceased and a mummified L. carcinophaga along with a mollusk (Nacella concinna) collected alive from different locations around Antarctica. We discuss their relationship in light of the C-14 reservoir. The age obtained for the recently deceased crabeater seals suggests a reservoir age of around 1300 yr for these waters, which is in agreement with the correction value for reservoir age obtained for the same species in the area. We applied this reservoir correction value to the conventional age of 1180 C-14 yr BP obtained for the mummified seal. The results indicate that the death event probably occurred within the last 100 yr. The age obtained for the mollusk specimen confirms that the correction values of the reservoir effect for the Antarctic continent vary according to geographical location and to the type of sample dated.																	0033-8222	1945-5755					2011	53	1					161	166		10.1017/S0033822200034433							WOS:000288745800013

Intraspecific variation in a dominant prey species can bias marine predator dietary estimates derived from stable isotope analysis	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY-METHODS												It is often assumed that variation in consumer stable isotope values (delta N-15 and delta C-13) reflect shifts in diet between isotopically distinct prey species. However, an alternate hypothesis is that such variation could be as a result of spatial, temporal, or ontogenetic variation in the stable isotope values of a key prey species that propagate up marine food chains. In the Southern Ocean, Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) occupy a key position, linking primary production to secondary consumers including fish, squid, seabirds, and marine mammals. As such Antarctic krill represent an ideal prey species to test the critical assumptions behind what has become a common method of dietary analysis in marine predators. Similar to previous studies, we found that stable isotope values of Antarctic krill exhibit significant intraspecific variation associated with both ontogenetic (size) and oceanographic factors (chlorophyll a concentration). Our modeling results showed that intraspecific variation in the stable isotope values of Antarctic krill has the potential to force mean isotope values of krill predators by as much as 2.4 parts per thousand, independent of changes in the species composition of diet. Our findings indicate that intraspecific variation in the stable isotope values of a single, dominate prey species, such as Antarctic krill, has the potential to bias both absolute and relative estimates of marine predator diets using stable isotope mixing models. Therefore, caution is warranted to avoid spatial, temporal, and ontogenetic mismatches between the stable isotope values of prey sources used in mixing models and the actual stable isotope values of prey consumed by marine predators.				, Jefferson/AAG-1702-2021	, Jefferson/0000-0002-3600-1414												1541-5856					APR	2019	17	4					292	303		10.1002/lom3.10314							WOS:000464952100005						
J	Iverson, SJ; Arnould, JPY; Boyd, IL				Iverson, SJ; Arnould, JPY; Boyd, IL			Milk fatty acid signatures indicate both major and minor shifts in the diet of lactating Antarctic fur seals	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY												Fatty acid signature analysis is based on the principle that unique arrays of fatty acids within groups of organisms can be transferred, largely unaltered, up the marine food chain and thus may be an indicator of diet composition. We applied fatty acid signature analysis to milks collected from Antarctic fur seals (Arctocephalus gazella) at South Georgia in 1990-1991, during the perinatal period (N = 19) and subsequently during early (N = II), mid (N = 11), and late (N = 8) foraging trips. In lactating otariid females, milk fatty acids secreted during the perinatal fast are derived largely from blubber mobilization and thus are influenced by dietary history prior to parturition. Conversely, milk fatty acids secreted during foraging trips are derived primarily from immediate dietary intake. The fatty acid signature of perinatal milks was significantly different from that of all other milks, suggesting differences in the prepartum diet when females are away from the breeding grounds. At the onset of foraging periods, the fatty acid composition of milks changed dramatically to reflect a diet composed mainly of krill. However, during late foraging periods, milk fatty acids again changed from those of early and mid foraging, and suggested a predominance of teleost fish in the diet. These findings were consistent with independent assessments of diet by faecal analysis and indicate the potential value of fatty acid signature analysis in studying foraging ecology in free-ranging pinnipeds.																	0008-4301	1480-3283				FEB	1997	75	2					188	197		10.1139/z97-026							WOS:A1997XB77500004

When the omega-3 index changes it follows that the relative fractions of other fatty acids in the membrane are also changed. In the present study, increasing doses of a preparation of omega-3 rich phospholipids extracted from krill oil were administered orally to non-human primates for 12 weeks and the time course of EPA, DHA and 22 other fatty acids in erythrocytes was determined bi-weekly during treatment and for 8 weeks after cessation of treatment. Plasma concentrations of six endocannabinoid-type mediators being downstream metabolites of some fatty acids analyzed in erythrocytes were also determined. Methods: Six diabetic, dyslipidemic non-human primates were included, three in a vehicle control group and three being treated with the omega-3 rich phospholipid preparation. The vehicle control and test items were given daily by gavage and the test item doses were 50, 150 and 450 mg phospholipids/ kg/ day. Each dose level was given for four weeks. Blood was sampled at baseline and thereafter bi-weekly. Fatty acids were determined in erythrocytes by methylation followed by gas-chromatography. Endocannabinoids and endocannabinoid-like mediators were analyzed in plasma by liquid chromatography-atmospheric pressure chemical ionization-mass spectrometry. Results: The treatment resulted in a dose-related increase in the fraction of EPA and DHA in erythrocyte membranes and a dose-related decrease of other poly-unsaturated fatty acids, in particular omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids. Erythrocyte concentrations of saturated fatty acids remained unchanged throughout the experiment. Plasma concentrations of endocannabinoids and endocannabinoid-like mediators changed accordingly as those being downstream arachidonic acid decreased, downstream of the saturated palmitic and oleic acids remained unchanged while a downstream EPA metabolite increased. Conclusion: Increasing the omega-3 index by administering an omega-3 rich phospholipid extracted from krill oil did not alter the ratio of unsaturated vs. saturated fatty acids in the erythrocyte membranes but only the relative concentrations of unsaturated fatty acids, in particular unsaturated omega-6 fatty acids. Concentrations of saturated fatty acids remained unchanged.

Under optimized conditions the extraction efficiency attained was 90.91 +/- 0.97% of EPA, 90.02 +/- 1.04% of DHA, and 91.85 +/- 1.11% of KO in the top n-hexane phase. The highest extraction efficiency of proteins and flavonoids, i.e. 88.34 +/- 1.35% and 79.67 +/- 1.13%, was recorded in the solid interface and ethanol phase, respectively. The KO extracted by TLPSOES system consisted of lowest fluoride level compared to the conventional method and whole wet krill biomass. The TLPSOES is a potential candidate for nutraceutical industry of KO extraction from wet krill biomass.

J	Barbraud, C; Weimerskirch, H				Barbraud, C; Weimerskirch, H			Contrasting effects of the extent of sea-ice on the breeding performance of an Antarctic top predator, the Snow Petrel Pagodroma nivea	JOURNAL OF AVIAN BIOLOGY												Recent studies have shown that the Antarctic Circumpolar Wave and the related sea-ice cover around the Antarctic continent may have a profound effect on the lower trophic levels of the marine environment. In particular, extensive sea-ice cover enhances the survival of krill. However, the effects of sea-ice cover on top predators remain poorly understood. Using time series from 1973 to 1999, we examine the influence of regional sea-ice extent on a number of indices of breeding performance of an avian predator, the Snow Petrel, in Antarctica. The percentage of breeding pairs was highly variable and there were fewer birds breeding when sea-ice cover was extensive during July. By contrast, overall breeding success and fledgling body condition were improved during years with extensive sea-ice cover during the preceding November and July-September. These results indicate that the same sea-ice conditions may have different effects on the breeding performance of a species. The overall increase in winter sea-ice extent during the last decade appears to have resulted in an overall improvement of the quality of fledglings produced, and thus probably of future recruitment.

However, the significance of this group as prey remains challenging to assess, and hence, gelatinous consumers are often depicted incorrectly as dead ends of pelagic food webs. In the Southern Ocean, where a shift in trophic webs may favour gelatinous animals, we video-monitored prey intake of a key predator. Twenty-eight chick-rearing Adelie penguins Pygoscelis adeliae from Dumont d'Urville station (66 degrees 40'S, 140 degrees 01'E) were instrumented with miniaturized video loggers in 2014-2015. Among other items (krill, fish), 101 gelatinous organisms (n = 79 jellyfish, 6 salps and 16 unidentified) were observed on 13 of 21 exploitable video footages (total: 59 h). Importantly, 65.3 % of gelatinous organisms were attacked, but among them salps were not attacked. Attacks on jellyfish were significantly associated with the visible presence of the jellyfish's gonad. Jellyfish were encountered at an average depth of 26.2 +/- 10.4 m, significantly shallower than krill. Attacks occurred mostly during bottom, but also descent or ascent dive phases. Concomitant GPS location for four birds revealed that attacks on jellyfish occurred above the shelf, 35 km north from the colony, where sea ice concentration reached 88 %. These results indicate that Adelie penguins occasionally feed on jellyfish, even though other prey types are also available. Refining our perception of scyphozoans' niche may thus help anticipate the functional response of the food webs to the extensive changes witnessed in the Antarctic environment.

During the CCAMLR 2000 Survey to estimate the biomass and distribution of Antarctic krill, International Whaling Commission observers carried out a visual line transect survey to estimate the number of baleen whales occurring in the survey area. This paper reviews techniques used to estimate krill consumption by baleen whales and in combination with estimates of whale abundance estimates of krill consumption are generated for the South Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean. This survey estimates that the present populations of whales feeding in this region are likely to consume approximately 1.6 million tonnes, but possibly up to as much as 2.7 million tonnes of krill within the summer season. Although this only represents 4-6% of the estimated krill biomass in the region (and probably less than this percentage of the total annual krill production), the depleted numbers of baleen whales resulting from past or current whaling activities should be taken into account when setting quotas for the commercial exploitation of krill if there is to be a recovery to pre-exploitation biomass levels of baleen whales.

The dominant species were the copepod Metridia gerlachei and the euphausiid Euphausia superba. We observed a vertical krill/copepod substitution in the water column. The zooplankton biomass in the layer at a depth of 200-500 m was of the same magnitude as the biomass in the layer at a depth of 0-200 m, indicating that biomass in the mesopelagic zone is an important fraction of the total zooplankton in Antarctic waters. The metabolic rates of the zooplankton community were sustained by less than 0.5% of the primary production in the area, suggesting that microplankton or small copepods are the main food source. Neither food availability nor predation seemed to control mesozooplankton biomass. The wide time lag between the abundance peak of the dominant copepod (M. gerlachei) and the phytoplankton bloom is suggested to be the main explanation for the low summer zooplankton biomass observed in these waters.

Euphausiid stomachs represent a specific niche for microbes that participate in the digestion of the host's dietary components. Methods for the study of the diversity and function of these microorganisms remain complex. Bacterial ribosomal sequences obtained from lysates of stomachs are often overrepresented by organisms from the surrounding environment. Flow cytometry with cell sorting ( FC-CS) have become a powerful technique to study microbial community structure but also for the study of population genomics of gut-associated bacteria. We compared the performance of the FC-CS-sequencing and total DNA extraction-sequencing to study the stomach microbiota of the Humboldt Current krill. Non-specific amplification was not retrieved in the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from cells sorted, opposite to the observed using the DNA from the whole lysate. Sequences obtained from the whole stomach DNA were enriched in picocyanobacteria, whereas sequences retrieved from cells sorted belonged almost exclusively to Balneola sp. of the new phylum Balneolaeota. Our results suggest that the stomach-associated microbiota can be successfully characterized by FC-CS and sequencing by manual scraping of the stomach. The implementation of this technique might complement future studies on host-microbes interaction and their implications on the marine pelagic food web.

Primary productivity off the Antarctic coast from 30 degrees-80 degrees E; BROKE-West survey, 2006	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY												Primary productivity was measured in the Indian Sector of the Southern Ocean (30 degrees to 80 degrees E) as part of a multi-disciplinary study during austral summer: Baseline Research on Oceanography, Krill and the Environment, West (BROKE-West Survey, 2006). Gross integrated (0-150 m) productivity rates within the marginal ice zone (MIZ) were significantly higher than within the open ocean, with averages of 2110.2 +/- 1347.1 and 595.0 +/- 283.0 mg C m(-2) d(-1), respectively. In the MIZ, high productivity was associated with shallow mixed-layer depths and increased P-max up to 5.158 mg C (mg chl a) h(-1). High Si:N drawdown ratios in the open ocean (4.1 +/- 1.5) compared to the MIZ (2.2 +/- 0.79) also suggested that iron limitation was important for the control of productivity. This was supported by higher F-v/F-m ratios in the MIZ (0.50 +/- 0.11 above 40 m) compared to the open ocean (0.36 +/- 0.08). As well, in the open ocean there were regions of elevated productivity associated with the seasonal pycnocline where iron availability was possibly increased. High silicate drawdown in the north-eastern section of the BROKE-West survey area suggested significant diatom growth and was linked to the presence of the southern Antarctic Circumpolar Current front (sACCF). However, low assimilation numbers (12.8-23.2 mg C mg chl a(-1) d(-1)) and F-v/F-m ratios indicated that cells were senescent with initial growth occurring earlier in the season. In the western section of the survey area within the MIZ, high NO3 drawdown but relatively low silicate drawdown were associated with a Phaeocystis bloom. NO3 concentrations were strongly negatively correlated with column-integrated productivity and chlorophyll biomass which was expected given the requirement for this nutrient by all phytoplankton groups. Regardless, concentrations of both NO3 and silicate were above limiting levels within the entire BROKE-West survey area (N > 15.7 mu M, Si > 18.3 mu M) supporting the high-nutrient low-chlorophyll status of the Southern Ocean.

Seasonal prey switching in non-breeding gentoo penguins related to a wintertime environmental anomaly around South Georgia	POLAR BIOLOGY												Information is needed on how anomalous environmental conditions affect important Antarctic ecological sentinels during the winter. Using a non-invasive method (scats), the diet of non-breeding gentoo penguins Pygoscelis papua at Bird Island, South Georgia, was examined during the winter of 2009 when local environmental conditions were abnormal (e.g. warmer sea surface waters). Scats were collected every 2 weeks from May until October 2009 (N = 168); the diet was dominated by the amphipod Themisto gaudichaudii by frequency of occurrence (77.5% of the samples) and by number (70.5% of the total individuals). By mass, different species of crustaceans (T. gaudichaudii and Antarctic krill Euphausia superba) and fish (Champsocephalus gunnari, Lepidonotothen larseni and Pseudochaenichthys georgianus) were the most important in different periods. Numerically, prey switching occurred at the end of winter, when E. superba became more abundant in the penguins' diets in late September and early October (austral spring), when sea surface temperatures became colder. T. gaudichaudii is sub-optimal prey for gentoo penguins and its consumption most likely reflects a lack of E. superba in local waters. The consumption of T. gaudichaudii and fish, in place of E. superba, was probably insufficient for the penguins to maintain a body condition suitable for reproduction, contributing to the observed late commencement of breeding (i.e. 2-3 weeks) that year. Our results highlight the sensitivity of gentoo penguin populations to variations in environmental conditions, particularly in terms of how these conditions affect the availability of preferred dietary items and potential follow-on effects in the subsequent breeding season.

J	MCKENNA, JE				MCKENNA, JE			SPATIAL STRUCTURE AND TEMPORAL CONTINUITY OF THE SOUTH GEORGIAN ANTARCTIC FISH COMMUNITY	FISHERY BULLETIN												Demersal fish represent one of the most heavily exploited resources in the Antarctic ecosystem. The stocks around South Georgia Island have contributed a substantial portion of the annual catches and have declined over the past decade. Fishing has been implicated as the cause of this decline. However, a clear description of the community structure of this system, which is necessary to judge the influence of fishing accurately, has been lacking. The spatial structure of the South Georgian fish community was investigated through the use of survey data collected over a three-year period. The results clearly indicated the absence of spatial structure in that community. The presence or absence of rare species at various stations was responsible for the weak structure found in the initial analysis. The general lack of structure was consistent from year to year. The available data do not provide an explanation for this lack of structure. All surveys were conducted during the austral summer only. Events and community structure at other times of the year remain unknown. Although the data were representative of the fish community during the austral summer, no comparable data were available on the abundance and distribution of their prey items, especially krill (Euphausia superba). More extensive sampling, expanded to include other seasons, is necessary to properly address the questions of seasonal change in community structure and the role of competition in this Antarctic system.																	0090-0656					JUL	1993	91	3					475	490									WOS:A1993MD44900007

Water-column processes in the West Antarctic Peninsula and the Ross Sea: Interannual variations and foodweb structure	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY												The sea-ice zone of the Antarctic exhibits high rates of primary productivity and large interannual variability in plankton and biogeochemical properties, influenced by variations in the timing, extent and duration of sea-ice advance and retreat. In the past decade several interdisciplinary research programs conducted investigations in the sea ice zones of the West Antarctic Peninsula (WAP) and Ross Sea. In this article we synthesize results of these investigations to provide an overview of water-column processes influenced by regional-scale sea-ice dynamics. Primary production (PP) off the WAP varies by nearly an order of magnitude from year-to-year, and its interannual variability is related to the amount of open water within the annual ice pack. The annual sedimentation at 170 m averages about 2% of the overlying PP but is not related to interannual variations in the ice or PP. Rather the interannual variations in sedimentation are related to stocks of krill and salps. Plankton foodwebs in the Ross Sea and WAP exhibit similar annual PP but differ greatly in quantitative foodweb structure. Foodwebs of the WAP are dominated by krill grazing of spring-summer diatom blooms, whereas in the Ross Sea the extensive and early (November) bloom of Phaeocystis antarctica is not grazed and similar to 50% sinks as ungrazed cells. Foodweb reconstructions from inverse models suggest that some functional characteristics of foodwebs in the two regions are quite similar in spite of taxonomic contrasts. Relatively high rates of microbial processing and nutrient recycling characterize both systems, even during years in the WAP when PP differs by an order of magnitude. These similarities indicate broad functional similarities across contrasting foodweb composition in the sea-ice zone. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Lagrangian simulation of transport pathways and residence times along the western Antarctic Peninsula	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY												The relative contribution of ocean circulation in producing areas where marine mammals and other predators concentrate to produce biological hot spots along the continental shelf of the western Antarctic Peninsula (wAP) was investigated with numerical Lagrangian particle tracking simulations. Circulation distributions used in the Lagrangian simulations were obtained from the Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS) configured for the wAP region, with a horizontal resolution of 4 km and a vertical resolution of 24 sigma-layers. To determine release points for the floats, the simulated circulation fields were first analyzed to estimate scales of temporal variability. The temporal decorrelation scales of the simulated surface flow over most of the wAP shelf were 2-3 days. However, decorrelation scales of about 40 days were found for the surface flow in the southern part of Marguerite Bay. Temporal decorrelation scales for the flow below the permanent pycnocline at the depth of Circumpolar Deep Water (CDW) intrusions (below 250 m) were between 40 and 70 days along the northern flank of Marguerite Trough and extending into Marguerite Bay. Near Adelaide Island, Anvers Island and the offshore side of Alexander Island, the velocity decorrelation scales varied between 40 and 60 days. Floats were released in the wAP simulated circulation fields along the outer and mid-shelf at a range of depths in different seasons. The simulated particle trajectories showed preferred sites for across-shelf transport, with Marguerite Trough being a primary pathway for movement of floats into Marguerite Bay, Crystal Sound and the inner shelf region. The three primary biological hot spots, Crystal Sound, Laubeuf Fjord, and off Alexander Island, were sites with the longest particle residence times, being 18-27 days for Alexander Island and Crystal Sound to almost 35 days for Laubeuf Fjord. However, the source regions and circulation processes that provided the input of particles differed for each site. The Lagrangian particle tracking results showed the importance of the circulation in developing localized biological hot spots along the wAP, perhaps by facilitating aggregation of planktonic prey.

J	Everson, I; Kock, KH				Everson, I; Kock, KH			Variations in condition indices of mackerel icefish at South Georgia from 1972 to 1997	CCAMLR SCIENCE												Mackerel icefish (Champsocephalus gunnari) are widespread on the South Georgia shelf, Antarctica, and have been fished commercially since the early 1970s. They are known to feed predominantly on krill. An index of condition which uses the ratio of the measured total mass to the estimated mass is shown to provide a good indicator of local krill density. The index is likely to be little affected by the reproductive cycle unless there is high krill availability during the months around the spawning time, and even then the effect is much less than the highest observed values, The condition index responds rapidly to changes in krill density and therefore can provide indications of short-term variations in krill availability. Condition index provides a useful proxy for krill density and is likely to be of considerable value in interpreting the results from ecosystem assessments such as that in progress under the auspices of CCAMLR.																	1023-4063						2001	8						119	132									WOS:000172274600008

J	Weimerskirch, H; Cherel, Y				Weimerskirch, H; Cherel, Y			Feeding ecology of short-tailed shearwaters: breeding in Tasmania and foraging in the Antarctic?	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												The food, feeding and physiological ecology of foraging were studied in the short-tailed shearwater Puffinus tenuirostris of Tasmania, to establish whether this species can rely an Antarctic food to fledge its chick. Parents were found to use a 2-fold foraging strategy, on average performing 2 successive short trips at sea of 1 to 2 d duration followed by 1 long trip of 9 to 17 d. These long foraging trips are the longest yet recorded for any seabird. During short trips the parents tend to lose mass, feeding the chick with Australian krill and fish larvae caught in coastal and neritic waters around Tasmania. The prey are caught at maximum diving depths of 13 m on average (maximum 30 m). During long trips, adults gain mass and feed their chicks with a very rich mixture of stomach oil and digested food composed of a high diversity of prey including myctophid fish, sub-Antarctic krill and squids. Prey are probably caught mainly in the Polar Frontal Zone, at least 1000 km south of Tasmania, at maximum depths of 58 m on average (maximum 71 m). Long foraging Mps in distant southern waters gave at least twice the yield of trips in close waters but during the former, yield decreased with the time spent foraging, as indicated by the inverse relationship between time spent foraging and adult body condition. Decisions whether to forage in close or distant waters appear to be determined by the body condition of the parents rather than by that of the chick. Good body condition of parents was associated with high blood prolactin levels: birds in poor body condition invested in the restoration of body reserves and went to the rich area of the Polar Frontal Zone or to Antarctic waters, whereas those in good condition continued to provision the chick with food caught in Tasmanian waters and use their body reserves. The species thus exploits 2 water masses that differ in profitability. Most of the energy budget for rearing the chick is balanced by prey caught in rich southern waters where the birds build up their body reserves and find most of the energy needed by the chick. However, nearby shallow waters are important for the breeding strategy as they allow an increased rate of energy flow to the chick. In a species as abundant as the short-tailed shearwater, the 2-fold strategy has the advantage of Limiting competition in coastal and shallow waters, as at any one time only 17% of birds are feeding there. The influence of the marine environment and energetic constraints on the evolution of provisioning strategies is discussed.

J	PETRI, G; ZAUKE, GP				PETRI, G; ZAUKE, GP			TRACE-METALS IN CRUSTACEANS IN THE ANTARCTIC OCEAN	AMBIO												To evaluate whether metal concentrations in crustaceans from the Antarctic Ocean may be suitable as indicators of background levels, the elements Cd, Pb, Cu and Zn were analyzed in 17 species. Samples were taken from RV Polarstern in the Weddell Sea (2/1985; 11/1986; 11/1987) and during the first German Underwater Expedition to the Antarctic Peninsula (2/1988). Metal concentrations found show considerable interspecific heterogeneity without consistent dependence on higher taxa. They are not low compared to other areas with the exceptation of Pb. In contrast, observed Cd levels in caridean decapods (Chorismus antarcticus and Notocrangon antarcticus) were among the highest Cd concentrations observed in marine crustaceans (13 mg kg(-1) d.w.). Cu and Zn concentrations are in many cases within ranges given in the literature. Extremely low Cu concentrations in the amphipod Maxilliphimedia longipes and the isopod Aega antarctica (6-8 mg kg(-1)) support the hypothesis that certain Antarctic species may show Cu deficiencies or reduced metal requirements. Therefore, Antarctic organisms should not be used as the basis for global background levels in monitoring studies. Toxicokinetic experiments with organisms from the Antarctic Ocean are necessary to obtain more insight into accumulation strategies as a basis for a ''calibration'' and an interpretation of observed whole-body metal concentrations.																	0044-7447					DEC	1993	22	8					529	536									WOS:A1993MU49700006						
J	Rayfuse, R				Rayfuse, Rosemary			Climate Change and Antarctic Fisheries: Ecosystem Management in CCAMLR	ECOLOGY LAW QUARTERLY												Climate change and associated ocean acidification present varied and complex threats to Antarctic fisheries, making conservation and sustainable management of these fisheries more challenging than ever. The ecosystem approach is generally considered to be the most effective way of enhancing the climate resilience of fisheries, and the Commission on the Conservation and Management of Antarctic Marine Living Resources is expressly charged with implementing that approach in achieving its conservation objective. Implementation of the ecosystem approach is, however, a complex and challenging matter, and the emerging need to graft climate change impacts onto the range of factors already to be considered exacerbates these difficulties. This Article examines the implications of climate change for Antarctic fisheries, focusing on issues of both ecosystem resilience and the institutional resilience of the Commission on the Conservation and Management of Antarctic Marine Living Resources. While the potential implications of climate change on the Antarctic marine ecosystem have been under general discussion in the Commission since 2002, the Commission still has a long way to go in moving to actively anticipate climate stressors, in absorbing their importance into its decision-making processes, and in reshaping its management measures to address climate-driven changes in the Antarctic marine ecosystem.																	0046-1121					OCT	2018	45	1					53	81		10.15779/Z381834271							WOS:000446322700003

However, identifying foraging among recorded dives often requires several assumptions. The simultaneous acquisition of images of the prey encountered, together with records of diving behavior will allow researchers to more fully investigate the nature of subsurface behavior. We tested a novel digital camera linked to a time-depth recorder on Antarctic fur seals (Arctocephalus gazella). During the austral summer 2000-2001, this system was deployed on six lactating female fur seals at Bird Island, South Georgia, each for a single foraging trip. The camera was triggered at depths greater than 10 m. Five deployments recorded still images (640 X 480 pixels) at 3-sec intervals (total 8,288 images), the other recorded movie images at 0.2-sec intervals (total 7,598 frames). Memory limitation (64 MB) restricted sampling to approximately 1.5 d of 5-7 d foraging trips. An average of 8.5% of still pictures (2.4%-11.6%) showed krill (Euphausia superba) distinctly, while at least half the images in each deployment were empty, the remainder containing blurred or indistinct prey, In one deployment krill images were recorded within 2.5 h (16 km, assuming 1.8 m/sec travel speed) of leaving the beach. Five of the six deployments also showed other fur seals foraging in conjunction with the study animal. This system is likely to generate exciting new avenues for interpretation of diving behavior.

Here, we present an analysis of AMW occurrence patterns based on a 9-year passive acoustic dataset (2008-2016) from 21 locations throughout the Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean (Weddell Sea). AMWs were detected acoustically at all mooring locations from May to December, with the highest presence between August and November (bio-duck calls present at more than 80% of days). At the southernmost recording locations, the bio-duck call was present up to 10 months of the year. Substantial inter-annual variation in the seasonality of vocal activity correlated to variation in local ice concentration. Our analysis indicates that part of the AMW population stays in the Weddell Sea during austral winter. The period with the highest acoustic presence in the Weddell Sea (September-October) coincides with the timing of the breeding season of AMW in lower latitudes. The bio-duck call could therefore play a role in mating, although other behavioural functions of the call cannot be excluded to date.

Satellite imagery and historical data have identified the southern boundary of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current(1) as a site of enhanced biological productivity(2). Meso-scale surveys off the Antarctic peninsula have related the abundances of Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) and salps (Salpa thompsoni) to inter-annual variations in sea-ice extent(3). Here we have examined the ecosystem structure and oceanography spanning 3,500 km of the east Antarctic coastline, linking the scales of local surveys and global observations. Between 80 degrees and 150 degrees E there is a threefold variation in the extent of annual sea-ice cover, enabling us to examine the regional effects of sea ice and ocean circulation on biological productivity. Phytoplankton, primary productivity, Antarctic krill, whales and seabirds were concentrated where winter sea-ice extent is maximal, whereas salps were located where the sea-ice extent is minimal. We found enhanced biological activity south of the southern boundary of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current rather than in association with it(2). We propose that along this coastline ocean circulation determines both the sea-ice conditions and the level of biological productivity at all trophic levels.

Egg size, clutch asymmetry and hatching dates varied between species and years without consistent patterns. In the south polar skuas, 12 to 38% of the variation in these parameters was explained by sea surface temperature, sea ice cover and local weather. In mixed species pairs and brown skuas, the influence of environmental factors on variation in clutch asymmetry and hatching date decreased to 10-29%, and no effect on egg size was found. Annual variation in offspring growth performance also differed between species with variable growth in chicks of south polar skuas and mixed species pairs, and almost uniform growth in brown skuas. Additionally, the dependency on oceanographic and climatic factors, especially local wind conditions, decreased from south polar skuas to brown skua chicks. Consistent in all species, offspring were more sensitive to environmental conditions during early stages; during the late chick stage (>33 d) chick growth was almost independent of environmental conditions. The net breeding success could not be predicted by any environmental factor in any skua species, suggesting it may not be a sensitive indicator of environmental conditions. Hence, the sensitivity of skuas to environmental conditions varied between species, with south polar skuas being more sensitive than brown skuas, and between breeding periods, with the egg parameters being more susceptible to oceanographic conditions. However, during offspring development, local climatic conditions became more important. We conclude that future climate change in the Maritime Antarctic will affect reproduction of skuas more strongly through changes in sea ice cover and sea surface temperature (and the resulting alterations to the marine food web) than through local weather conditions.

J	Weimerskirch, H; Fradet, G; Cherel, Y				Weimerskirch, H; Fradet, G; Cherel, Y			Natural and experimental changes in chick provisioning in a long-lived seabird, the Antarctic Prion	JOURNAL OF AVIAN BIOLOGY												ability of Antarctic Prions Pachyptila desolata to regulate their provisioning effort was studied at Kerguelen Islands by comparing two seasons when food availability differed, and by experimental manipulation of foraging costs. Antarctic Prions provision their chick by a two-fold foraging strategy: on average, they alternate a long foraging trip 7-9 days long when they build up body reserves and then feed the chick, with 2 or 3 successive short trips lasting 1 or 2 days when they use previously stored body reserves to forage for provisioning the chick. Although hatching success and fledging success were similar for the two seasons examined, chicks produced in 1996 grew faster and were heavier at the end of the study than in 1995. The difference was due to a higher provisioning rate in 1996 resulting from long trips being 2 days shorter than in 1995, because the Antarctic waters where adults are believed to feed on Antarctic krill during these long trips were 330 km further away in 1995 than in 1996. While returning from long trips, and during short trips, prions mainly feed close to the colonies on the amphipod Themisto gaudichaudii. This prey was less available in 1995, but prions were able to switch to other prey. Cost of foraging was increased experimentally by adding mass to adults. Loaded parents differed from control parents only by increasing the duration of long foraging trips. The results of both the experiment and the study of the natural variation indicate that the ability of Antarctic Prions to increase provisioning is limited. Birds kept their body mass stable, provided food loads of similar mass and had short foraging trips of similar duration. During long trips they spent longer time foraging either to reach more distant feeding grounds or to cover higher foraging costs. The main constraint on chick provisioning is probably the necessity for birds to maintain,a threshold body mass to limit the risk of increased mortality due to breeding effort; the higher yields during long foraging trips permit them to do so.

Subsurface intrusions of upper circumpolar deep water (UCDW) onto the shelf provide much of the nutrient flux into the region. Here we describe the small-scale processes that contribute to upward diapycnal fluxes of heat, salt, and nutrients from the UCDW to the surface-mixed layer. The study makes use of conductivity-temperature-depth and vessel-mounted acoustic Doppler current profiler data collected during three research cruises between April and September 2001. Near-inertial baroclinic waves generated by wind stress provide most of the shear across the sharp pycnocline at the base of the mixed layer. The mean vertical diffusivity associated with shear instability is estimated at less than or equal to 1 x 10(-5) m(2) s(-1), corresponding to a heat flux into the base of the mixed layer of < 2 W m(-2). A previous suggestion that double-diffusive convection (DDC) provides significant upward heat fluxes (of order 10 W m(-2)) in a nearby region is not supported by our analyses of the present data set, which indicates almost no contribution to diapyncal fluxes from DDC.

G.; Bathmann, Ulrich			Seasonal changes in the vertical distribution and community structure of Antarctic macrozooplankton and micronekton	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART I-OCEANOGRAPHIC RESEARCH PAPERS												The macrozooplankton and micronekton community of the Lazarev Sea (Southern Ocean) was investigated at 3 depth layers during austral summer, autumn and winter: (1) the surface layer (0-2 m); (2) the epipelagic layer (0-200 m); and (3) the deep layer (0-3000 m). Altogether, 132 species were identified. Species composition changed with depth from a euphausiid-dominated community in the surface layer, via a siphonophore-dominated community in the epipelagic layer, to a chaetognath-dominated community in the deep layer. The surface layer community predominantly changed along gradients of surface water temperature and sea ice parameters, whereas the epipelagic community mainly changed along hydrographical gradients. Although representing only 1% of the depth range of the epipelagic layer, mean per-area macrofauna densities in the surface layer ranged at 8% of corresponding epipelagic densities in summer, 6% in autumn, and 24% in winter. Seasonal shifts of these proportional densities in abundant species indicated different strategies in the use of the surface layer, including both hibernal downward and hibernal upward shift in the vertical distribution, as well as year-round surface layer use by Antarctic krill. These findings imply that the surface layer, especially when it is ice-covered, is an important functional node of the pelagic ecosystem that has been underestimated by conventional depth-integrated sampling in the past. The exposure of this key habitat to climate-driven forces most likely adds to the known susceptibility of Antarctic pelagic ecosystems to temperature rise and changing sea ice conditions.

J	Lynnes, AS; Reid, K; Croxall, JP				Lynnes, AS; Reid, K; Croxall, JP			Diet and reproductive success of Adelie and chinstrap penguins: linking response of predators to prey population dynamics	POLAR BIOLOGY												The diet and reproductive performance of two sympatric penguin species were studied at Signy Island, South Orkney Islands between 1997 and 2001. Each year, Adelie (Pygoscelis adeliae) and chinstrap (P. antarctica) penguins fed almost exclusively (>99% by mass) on Antarctic krill; however, there was considerable inter-annual variation in reproductive output. In 1998, chinstrap penguins were adversely affected by extensive sea-ice in the vicinity of the colony, whereas Adelie penguins were unaffected by this. However, in 2000, both species suffered reduced reproductive output. Detailed analysis of the population-size structure of krill in the diet indicated a lack of recruitment of small krill into the population since 1996. A simple model of krill growth and mortality indicated that the biomass represented by the last recruiting cohort would decline dramatically between 1999 and 2000. Thus, despite the lack of a change in the proportion of krill in the diet, the population demographics of the krill population suggested that the abundance of krill may have fallen below the level required to support normal breeding success of penguins sometime before or during the 2000 breeding season. The role of marine predators as indicator species is greatly enhanced when studies provide data reflecting not only the consequences of changes in the ecosystem but also those data that elucidate the causes of such changes.																	0722-4060	1432-2056				AUG	2004	27	9					544	554		10.1007/s00300-004-0617-1							WOS:000223264400004

We determined natural abundances of stable-nitrogen (delta(15)N) and stable-carbon (delta(13)C) isotopes from blood samples (n = 283) from adults and chicks of 4 Antarctic fulmarine petrel species (Fulmarus glacialoides, Thalassoica antarctica, Daption capense and Pagodroma nivea) during 2 consecutive breeding seasons, 1994/1995 and 1995/1996, and from representative prey items. Our objectives were to use the isotope approach to infer trophic status and diet composition within and between species, addressing interspecific and temporal variability within this seabird community, and to investigate potential age-related differences in assumed trophic position within species. Prey delta(13)C values ranged from -26.8 parts per thousand in amphipods to -23.9 parts per thousand in adult Antarctic silverfish. Seabird delta(13)C values ranged from -25.3 parts per thousand in Antarctic petrel chicks to -23.8 parts per thousand. in cape petrel adults. Prey delta(15)N values ranged from 4.0 parts per thousand in euphausiids to 10.7 parts per thousand in adult Antarctic silverfish. Seabird delta(15)N values ranged from 8.4 parts per thousand in Antarctic petrel adults to 12.0 parts per thousand in snow petrel chicks. There was considerable interspecific overlap in assumed trophic positions amongst the 4 petrel species, and we conclude all species consumed fish and krill. Despite this apparent overlap, the range in delta(15)N values for petrels corresponded to the equivalent of 1 full trophic level, and estimated trophic level varied with both species and age. A simple trophic level model, constructed based on the delta(15)N data, predicted trophic levels ranging from 2.3 in krill to 4.7 in snow petrel chicks. Snow petrels and Antarctic fulmars tended to have higher delta(15)N values than Antarctic and cape petrels, suggesting a higher proportion of fish in their diets. Petrel chicks consistently had higher delta(15)N values than adults, which suggests trophic segregation between adults and chicks. We discuss advantages of selectively provisioning chicks with higher trophic level prey. Extensive overlap and a relatively narrow range of delta(15)N values are consistent with a food web comprised of few trophic steps.

Collecting and processing euphausiids	JOURNAL OF CRUSTACEAN BIOLOGY												Euphausiid crustaceans, commonly referred to as krill, are fast-moving, pelagic, exclusively marine, and found in all oceans generally below 50 m. While restricted to only 86 species in two families, the six largest-size species are abundant in higher latitudes and of commercial interest. Assessment of stocks and collection of specimens generally involves location using active-acoustic surveying and towed equipment from research vessels. Capturing live euphausiids for physiological work requires particular care. The appropriate treatment of specimens obtained depends upon the reason for their collection and a range of options are discussed.																	0278-0372	1937-240X				MAR	2017	37	2					228	231		10.1093/jcbiol/rux002							WOS:000401916100011

Fish-eating seabirds are recognized to be at risk of accumulating toxic contaminants due to their high position in the trophic web and to their low ability to metabolize xenobiotic compounds. Penguins are widely distributed in Antarctica and represent an important fraction of the Antarctic biomass. They feed mainly on krill and, depending on krill availability, also on fish. It has been reported that predators may be a sink for volatile and toxic chemicals and this may pose a serious environmental problem. Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), polychlorinated dibenzo-dioxins (PCDDs), -furans (PCDFs), and -biphenyls (PCBs), including non-ortho congeners, hexachlorobenzene (HCB) and p,p'-DDE, were quantified in three species of Antarctic Pygoscelids in order to evaluate their accumulation patterns. The potential toxicity of twenty-two dioxin-like congeners was assessed and expressed as 2,3,7,8-tetra CDD equivalents (TEQs). Differences between males and females were investigated. Methods. Blood samples of the Adelie penguin Pygoscelis adeliae, Chinstrap penguin Pygoscelis antarctica and Gentoo penguin Pygoscelis papua were collected at Admiralty Bay, King George Is (62 degrees 10'39" S, 58 degrees 26'46" W) in February 2004. Halogenated hydrocarbons were identified and quantified using gas chromatography coupled with gas chromatography mass spectrometry analyses. Results are expressed on a wet weight basis. Results and Discussion. HCB, p,p'-DDE and Sigma PCBs were higher in Adelie penguins (6.7 +/- 6.1, 8.2 +/- 3.3 and 9.8 +/- 3.8 ng/g, respectively) than in Chinstrap and Gentoo penguins, both of which showed values in the same order of magnitude, but approximately 40% lower than Adelie penguins. Hexa-CBs ranged 35-45% of the residue. Low-chlorinated PCBs (nos. 70+76+95+56+60+101) accounted for 40-60% in the three species. PCB101 made up 15% of,the residue in Adelie penguins. PBDEs were 291 +/- 477, 107 +/- 104 and 116 +/- 108 pg/g in Adelie, Chinstrap and Gentoo penguins, respectively; the most abundant congeners were BDE47 in Adelie and Chinstrap penguins and BDE17 in Gentoo penguins. PCDDs were 22 +/- 32, 6.5 +/- 7.4 and 18 +/- 23 pg/g in Adelie, Chinstrap and Gentoo penguins, respectively. PCDFs were higher in Addie penguins and lower in Chinstrap penguins. PCDDs/Fs and PBDEs were higher in males than in females of Gentoo and Chinstrap penguins; differences in concentrations were likely related to the partial detoxification that occurs in females during egg formation. Of the four non-ortho PCBs measured, PCB126 occurredat the highest concentrations and contributed the majority of the non-ortho PCB-TEQ in Gentoo and Chinstrap penguins. The highest TEQs were found in the Gentoo penguin and due mainly to PCDDs and non-ortho PCBs. Conclusions. POP concentrations in penguins were lower than those found in seabird species from other areas of the world. Different chemical accumulation patterns were observed in relation to species and sex; the Adelie penguin showed the highest POP levels. Dissimilar ecological or metabolic features may be involved; the diverse timing of reproduction steps can be responsible for those differences; moreover, Adelie penguins feed on krill (a fatty resource) more abundantly than the other two species during the rearing period. Recommendation and Outlook. The South Shetland Islands might be subjected to a higher chemical impact with respect to the rest of Antarctica, due to their being near South America. Because penguins are fish-eating birds showing low detoxifying capacities and key-species in Antarctic ecosystems, further studies on their xenobiotic metabolism should be carried out.

Total lipid was high in C. limacina (29-36 mg g(-1) wet mass) and included 46% of diacylglyceryl ether (DAGE, as % of total lipid) for both 1997 and 1998. DAGE was not detected in C. pyramidata, which had mainly polar lipid and triacylglycerol. 1-O-Alkyl glyceryl ethers (GE) derived from the DAGE consisted primarily of 15:0 and 16:0, with lower 17:0 and a17:0. The principal sterols of both pteropods included trans-dehydrocholesterol, brassicasterol, 24-methylenecholesterol, cholesterol and desmosterol. Levels of 24-methylenecholesterol and desmosterol were lower in both pteropods in 1997 compared to 1998. C. limacina had high levels of the odd-chain fatty acids 17:1(n - 8)c and 15:0 in contrast to C. pyramidata. The previously proposed source of elevated odd-chain fatty acids in C. limacina is via propionate derived from phytoplankton DMPT; another possible source may be from thraustochytrids, which are common marine microheterotrophs. C. pyramidata had twice as much PUFA as C. limacina, largely due to higher 20:5(n - 3). The PUFA 18:5(n - 3) and very long chain fatty acids (C-24, C-26 and C-28 VLC-PUFA) were only detected in 1998 pteropods. In comparison, 1996 samples of C. limacina contained lower DAGE levels, which also may reflect differences in diet and oceanographic conditions. Interannual variations in specific lipid biomarkers are discussed with respect to possible different phytoplankton food sources available in the AMLR survey area. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Inc.

We compared our results with those from Anvers Island, Bellingshausen Sea. Colony sizes at Ross Island have been increasing, contrary to decreasing size at Anvers Island. At Ross Island, during the month prior to fledging, chick diet consisted equally of energy-dense Antarctic silverfish Pleuragramma antarctica and less-caloric crystal krill Euphausia crystallorophias, while at Anvers Island the diet was principally Antarctic krill E. superba. At Ross Island, the mass of fledglings who subsequently returned (mean +/- SE: 3.4 +/- 0.0411 kg) exceeded that of those not seen again (3.2 +/- 0.0251 kg), compared to Anvers Island (3.2 vs. 3.0 kg, respectively). At Ross Island, fledging mass was inversely related to colony size and, at the largest colony, fledging mass decreased as the colony grew. Average mass of returnees at the largest colony was less than the mass at Anvers Island for those fledglings that did not return. The mean proportion of fish in the chicks' diet decreased at the largest Ross Island colony over time, as did fledging mass. We hypothesize that intraspecific competition increased along with colony size, decreasing the availability of fish. We further hypothesize that at the large Ross Island colony, post-fledging penguins must be finding adequate prey, and more energy-dense fish, just outside the colony's foraging area to explain opposing trends in colony trajectories.

Distinct inter-tissue differences in metal concentrations in seals were observed, liver contained maximum levels of Zn, Cu, Ag and Mn, whilst kidney showed the highest levels of Cd, Ni and Co. Muscle was characterized by low concentrations of all the elements analyzed. The metal concentrations in the vertebrates analyzed were compared with those for organisms originating from various aquatic areas. Significant correlations were found between the levels of several of the metals analyzed, e.g. between renal and hepatic concentrations of Zn and Cd, Strong relationships between the hepatic concentrations of some metals were found, e.g. Cd-Zn. These two metals also showed a significant coassociation in their renal concentrations. The slope of the regression line for renal Cd/Zn was about three times higher than the hepatic one and this may reflect a relatively high Cd exposure, probably from specific food (squid and krill) provenance, of the seals analyzed.

The data indicate that C. acutus and R. gigas have the bases of their distributional ranges (sensu Makarov et al. 1982) in the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) and in the Warm Deep Water (WDW) entering the Weddell Gyre (WG). C. propinquus lived mainly in the cold WG south of the ACC. C. acutus overwintered mainly in the WG as stage IV copepodites (C). The species mainly inhabited the layers below the T(max)degrees stratum and down to 2000 m, but C V and females occurred slightly higher than C III and IV. Males prevailed over females and were confined to a rather narrow layer between 500 and 1000 m. Feeding experiments suggested all deep-living stages to be resting. However, if this species spawns in late autumn the younger C I-II can stay in the Winter Water (WW). R. gigas inhabited mainly the T(max)degrees stratum. In the eastern part of the WG, R. gigas breed in the WDW in autumn and hibernate as C I-III and C V-VI in the first and second winter, respectively. In the ACC zone, however, its life cycle is different and winter breeding of overwintered adults occurs. Most of the C. propinquus population overwintered in the WG as C III-V, inhabiting the WW. In the upper water layers in the interior of the WG, C III dominated with upto 18,000 individuals 1,000 m3. Shallow living C. propinquus were in the active, feeding state. Persistence of active feeding zooplankton populations in the WW of the WG can be an important factor influencing processes of phytoplankton development and the particle flux.																	0722-4060	1432-2056				JUL	1993	13	5					333	346									WOS:A1993LP06200007

The biomass of the large euphausiid Antarctic krill may range from ca. 2 to 150 g fresh mass (FM) m(-2). When krill biomass is low, copepod biomass may be correspondingly higher and overall zooplankton biomass remains more or less unchanged. Krill are omnivorous, feeding facultatively either as grazers on microplankton or as predators on smaller zooplankton. This leads to complex feedbacks within the plankton. A simple model of the phytoplankton-copepod-krill system is used to simulate two scenarios of zooplankton composition. For the "low krill-high copepod'' scenario, the model predicts higher phytoplankton biomass and production, lower mixed layer (ML) ammonium, nitrate and silicate concentrations, and higher detrital carbon production than in the "high krill-low copepod'' scenario. Nitrogen cycling provides the most explicit demonstration of the differences between the scenarios. For the "low krill-high copepod'' scenario, ML ammonium concentration decreased by 25% over 20 days, but excretion by metazooplankton supplied 30% of phytoplankton nitrogen demand. In the "high krill-low copepod'' scenario, ML ammonium only declined by 10% over 20 days, but metazooplankton excretion was much lower, at 10% of phytoplankton N demand. These predictions are compared with data from several surveys covering krill biomass in the range 10-55 g FM m(-2). Phytoplankton chlorophyll biomass is negatively related to krill biomass, and ML nutrients are positively correlated with krill biomass in these data. Both observations and model results suggest that variation in biogeochemical carbon and nitrogen cycles in the South Georgia pelagic ecosystem is determined largely by changes in zooplankton community composition and its impact on phytoplankton dynamics.

Its trypsin, as a main substance in the metabolic reactions, plays a key role in the adaption to low temperatures. However, the progress of research on its cold-adaption mechanism is being influenced due to the limited information on its gene and spatial structure. RESULTSWe studied the gene of E. superba trypsin with transcriptome sequencing first, and then discussed its cold-adaption mechanism with the full gene and predicted structure basing on bioinformatics. The results showed the proportion of certain residues played important roles in the cold-adaptation behavior for trypsin. Furthermore, a higher proportion of random coils and reduced steric hindrance might also be key factors promoting its cold adaption. CONCLUSIONThis research aimed to reveal the cold-adaption mechanism of E. superba trypsin and provide support for basic research on molecular modification by site-directed mutagenesis of complementary DNA used to produce new and improved recombinant variants with cold adaption. Furthermore, it may broaden its commercial application on minimizing undesirable changes elevated at higher temperature in food processing and in treatment of trauma and inflammation in medicine.

The temporal and spatial distribution of krill (Meganyctiphanes norvegica) at the deep seabed of the Faroe-Shetland Channel, UK: A potential mechanism for rapid carbon flux to deep sea communities	MARINE BIOLOGY RESEARCH												The temporal and spatial distribution of Meganyctiphanes norvegica near the seabed (< 5 m above the seafloor) was investigated using remotely operated vehicle (ROV) video footage from eight sites in the Faroe-Shetland Channel. Meganyctiphanes norvegica was most abundant near the seabed at 400-600 m depth, which corresponds to a temperature transitional region between shallower warmer water and deeper cold water. Densities of M. norvegica were significantly lower in the warm water, and no krill were detected at 900-1500 m depth in the cold water. Meganyctiphanes norvegica densities declined at night owing to daily vertical migrations. Time-series analysis showed higher krill densities at 06:00-09:00 and 18:00-21:00 at a depth of 400-480 m and at 12:00-15:00 at a depth of 600 m. A great reduction in krill abundance in winter was detected from both ROV surveys and continuous plankton recorder records. Meganyctiphanes norvegica was observed feeding on benthic particulate organic matter on the seafloor and being consumed by benthic and epibenthic predators. The maximum density of M. norvegica at 480 m depth was 596 9 261 individuals m(-3). This represents a standing stock of 12.8 +/- 5.6 g C m(-3) with an egestion rate of 0.63 +/- 0.28 g C m(-3) day(-1). Meganyctiphanes norvegica potentially provides an important source of carbon for communities in the deep waters of the Faroe-Shetland Channel.

J	Jarman, SN; Gales, NJ; Tierney, M; Gill, PC; Elliott, NG				Jarman, SN; Gales, NJ; Tierney, M; Gill, PC; Elliott, NG			A DNA-based method for identification of krill species and its application to analysing the diet of marine vertebrate predators	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY												Accurate identification of species that are consumed by vertebrate predators is necessary for understanding marine food webs. Morphological methods for identifying prey components after consumption often fail to make accurate identifications of invertebrates because prey morphology becomes damaged during capture, ingestion and digestion. Another disadvantage of morphological methods for prey identification is that they often involve sampling procedures that are disruptive for the predator, such as stomach flushing or lethal collection. We have developed a DNA-based method for identifying species of krill (Crustacea: Malacostraca), an enormously abundant group of invertebrates that are directly consumed by many groups of marine vertebrates. The DNA-based approach allows identification of krill species present in samples of vertebrate stomach contents, vomit, and, more importantly, faeces. Utilizing samples of faeces from vertebrate predators minimizes the impact of dietary studies on the subject animals. We demonstrate our method first on samples of Adelie penguin (Pygoscelis adeliae) stomach contents, where DNA-based species identification can be confirmed by prey morphology. We then apply the method to faeces of Adelie penguins and to faeces of the endangered pygmy blue whale (Balaenoptera musculus brevicauda). In each of these cases, krill species consumed by the predators could be identified from their DNA present in faeces or stomach contents.

J	MURPHY, EJ				MURPHY, EJ			SPATIAL STRUCTURE OF THE SOUTHERN-OCEAN ECOSYSTEM - PREDATOR-PREY LINKAGES IN SOUTHERN-OCEAN FOOD WEBS	JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY												1. The food chain of the Southern Ocean has often been characterized as simple and homogeneous. However, the population processes of a key prey organism, krill Euphausia superba, operate over ocean basin scales and are strongly influenced by large scale abiotic factors. 2. A model was developed in which the local prey abundance was regulated by a continuous, hydrodynamically mediated, supply rate and the concentrating effects of abiotic-biotic interactions. This model was used with estimates of the annual predator demands and the prey concentration for the South Georgia area to investigate the relationship between flow rate and depletion in prey concentration as a function of distance from a predator colony. 3. The model results indicated that concentrating factors need to be large to produce the build-up of krill densities of the order estimated to occur in the South Georgia area, with the peak retention rates required some distance offshore. It was, however, found that, for the estimated supply rates, the region does not need to be an area of particularly high prey concentration to support the estimated predator impact. 4. Differential predator foraging ranges produced a more complex response to the reduction of the abundance of particular predators by harvesting, than in the situation where foraging ranges overlapped completely. In such a system the more inshore foraging predators encountered the greatest changes in prey abundance. 5. Random fluctuations in the interannual prey availability were introduced into the simulation of the flow system. This could lead to apparent population cycling in predator and prey abundance due to the interactive form of the system, although the prey population dynamics were not involved. The system enhanced variability such that inshore foraging predators encountered greater variation in prey supply. 6.

While salp abundance is hypothesized to increase, krill abundance is hypothesized to decline with dramatic consequences for the entire food web of the Southern Ocean. A better understanding of the biotic interaction between krill and salps and their population dynamics is thus crucial. However, the life cycle of salps is complicated and barely understood. Therefore, we have developed an individual-based model describing the whole life cycle to better understand the population dynamics of salps and the conditions for blooms. The model has been used to explore if and under what conditions the empirical pattern of large variability in observed salp abundances at the WAP, generated by the long-term data of the US Antarctic Marine Living Resources Program (AMLR) can emerge from a small seeding population. The model reproduced this empirical pattern if daily growth rates of oozoids were higher than previously reported for the WAP (mean growth rate for oozoids similar to 1 mm d(-1)) and if growth rates of blastozooids were lower (mean growth rate similar to 0.2 mm d(-1)). The model suggests that a prerequisite for local salp blooms requires a small founding population in early spring. With climate change it has been suggested that more frequent and earlier transport of salps into the WAP or winter survival will occur. Hence, the risk of salp blooms in the WAP is likely to substantially increase. These findings highlight the importance for an improved quantitative understanding of how primary production and the southward advection of salps will be impacted by climate change.

Median and maximum dive depths for individuals varied from 8 to 19 m and from 82 to 181 m, respectively, and median and maximum dive durations from 0. 75 to 1. 17 min and from 2.8 - 10.0 min, respectively. Theoretical aerobic diving limits were exceeded on < 1 % of dives. Dives were mainly V-shaped. Sixty percent of dives were to less than 20 m depth, and these dives were distinguished from deep dives ( > 20 m) by having slower rates of descent and ascent and by being confined to the mixed layer at the ocean surface, as judged by records of sea temperature obtained concurrently with records of depth. Dives were grouped into bouts, defined by inflexion points observed in the cumulative probability distribution of surface interval after probit transformation. Bouts (defined by preceding and succeeding surface intervals lasting 13-24 min) occurred within a diel pattern of diving activity, with 74-85 % of dives occurring at night. The pattern of diving, in terms of division into bouts, showed greater differences between individual seals than did dive depth and duration. Dives tended to be shorter and shallower later in lactation. Most variation in diving behaviour between individuals was in terms of the proportion of available time spent foraging, bout frequency, and bout duration. The foraging strategy in the Antarctic fur seal is geared to exploiting prey within the surface mixed layer.																	0008-4301					MAY	1992	70	5					919	928		10.1139/z92-131							WOS:A1992JD66800012

The morphology and ontogeny of E. mucronata is known from calyptopis I to the adult phase, but the embryonic and early-life stages (nauplius and metanauplius) of this broadcast spawning species are unknown. We describe the morphology and development time of these life stages to complete the knowledge of its life cycle. Embryos were obtained from purple-gonad gravid females collected off Dichato, central Chile, during November 2012. Eight gravid females (mean=16mm total length) were incubated in seawater at 12 degrees C under laboratory conditions. The average development time from single-cell embryos to the metanauplius stage was 2.2d and hatching occurred between 20 and 25h. The average growth rate was 0.35mmd(-1) from the late limb bud to the metanauplius stage (range=0.21-0.48mmd(-1)). Embryos of E. mucronata had a mean chorion diameter of 0.460mm, embryo diameter of 0.343mm, and perivitelline space of 0.056mm. Our biological information reported here constitutes a baseline for future ecological studies on distribution and temporal variability of spawning activity and reproductive strategies of E. mucronata in the highly variable and productive Humboldt Current ecosystem.

POLAR BIOLOGY												The analysis of 523 scats collected at Harmony Point, Nelson Island, South Shetland Islands, from January to March in 2001 and 2002, indicated that the diet of non-breeding male Antarctic fur seals Arctocephalus gazella was diverse and composed of both pelagic and benthic-demersal prey. Overall, the Antarctic krill Euphausia superba and fish were the most frequent and numerous prey, followed by penguins, cephalopods (mainly squid) and gastropods. Myctophids represented 86.5% and 65.8% of the fish mass in 2001 and 2002 respectively, with Gymnoscopelus nicholsi being the main prey. Interestingly, penguin remains were present in 39.0% and 31.9% of the samples in 2001 and 2002, respectively and these birds were the main prey by reconstituted mass (74.0% and 76.1% in both seasons). The occurrence of penguins in the diet of A. gazella at Harmony Point is discussed in terms of the foraging strategy employed by seals and the temporal availability of prey.																	0722-4060					JAN	2004	27	2					59	65		10.1007/s00300-003-0559-z							WOS:000187918600001

J	Watters, GM; Hinke, JT; Reiss, CS				Watters, George M.; Hinke, Jefferson T.; Reiss, Christian S.			Long-term observations from Antarctica demonstrate that mismatched scales of fisheries management and predator-prey interaction lead to erroneous conclusions about precaution	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS												Low catch limits for forage species are often considered to be precautionary measures that can help conserve marine predators. Difficulties measuring the impacts of fisheries removals on dependent predators maintain this perspective, but consideration of the spatio-temporal scales over which forage species, their predators, and fisheries interact can aid assessment of whether low catch limits are as precautionary as presumed. Antarctic krill are targeted by the largest fishery in the Southern Ocean and are key forage for numerous predators. Current krill removals are considered precautionary and have not been previously observed to affect krill-dependent predators, like penguins. Using a hierarchical model and 30+ years of monitoring data, we show that expected penguin performance was reduced when local harvest rates of krill were >= 0.1, and this effect was similar in magnitude to that of poor environmental conditions. With continued climate warming and high local harvest rates, future observations of penguin performance are predicted to be below the long-term mean with a probability of 0.77. Catch limits that are considered precautionary for forage species simply because the limit is a small proportion of the species' standing biomass may not be precautionary for their predators.				, Jefferson/AAG-1702-2021	, Jefferson/0000-0002-3600-1414; Watters, George/0000-0002-6989-1273												2045-2322					FEB 11	2020	10	1							2314	10.1038/s41598-020-59223-9							WOS:000562857400006	32047241

Nitrate, phosphate and silicate were available in sufficiently higher concentrations at Polar Front zone. Nitrate and silicate, exhibited a marked boundaries between high values in the Sub Antarctic region. Diatom dominated the phytoplankton in the study region and their numbers generally increases southward with peaks of abundance in Sub Antarctic waters. Dinoflagellates, flagellates and "monads" occur in highest concentration north of the Polar Front zone. Various diatom assemblages are characteristics of different latitudinal zones. Vicinity of the Polar Front was found to be rich in Nitzschia, Pseudonitzschia group of species. South of Polar Front Nitzschia."nana" (Cells of both N. cylindrus and N. pseudonana) and Dactyliosolen tenuijunctus dominate. Diatoms viz. Fragilariopsis kerguelensis and Thalassionema nitzschioides; were reported earlier and present studies. Present study laso reveals that the diatom Pseudonitzschia spp. were numerous in numbers.																	0379-5136					OCT	2011	40	5					671	679									WOS:000298525800011						
J	Nevitt, GA				Nevitt, GA			Olfactory foraging by Antarctic procellariiform seabirds: Life at high Reynolds numbers	BIOLOGICAL BULLETIN												Antarctic procellariiform seabirds forage over vast stretches of open ocean in search of patchily distributed prey resources. These seabirds are unique in that most species have anatomically well-developed olfactory systems and are thought to have an excellent sense of smell. Results from controlled experiments performed at sea near South Georgia Island in the South Atlantic indicate that different species of procellariiforms are sensitive to a variety of scented compounds associated with their primary prey. These include krill-related odors (pyrazines and trimethylamine) as well as odors more closely associated with phytoplankton (dimethyl sulfide, DMS). Data collected in the context of global climatic regulation suggest that at least one of these odors (DMS) tends to be associated with predictable bathymetry, including upwelling zones and seamounts. Such odor features are not ephemeral but can be present for days or weeks. I suggest that procellariiforms foraging over vast distances may be able to recognize these features reflected in the olfactory landscape over the ocean. On the large scale, such features may aid seabirds in navigation or in locating profitable foraging grounds. Once in a profitable foraging area, procellariiforms may use olfactory cues on a small scale to assist them in locating prey patches.																	0006-3185	1939-8697				APR	2000	198	2					245	253		10.2307/1542527							WOS:000086627100007	10786944

Collected data were used for model-based abundance estimates of fin whales in 2 strata. The minimum average (+/- SE) density of fin whales was estimated at 0.0268 +/- 0.0183 ind. km(-2) in a 19 750 km(2) area around Elephant Island, resulting in a minimum abundance estimate of 528 +/- 362 fin whales. In a 13 550 km(2) area around the South Orkney Islands, we estimated a minimum density of 0.0588 +/- 0.0381 ind. km(-2) and a minimum abundance of 796 +/- 516 ind. The results of this study confirm a westerly extension of a recently described high-density area for fin whales in the West Antarctic Peninsula region. In the light of increasing krill fisheries in the local region, we suggest this area for further studies to assess the potential for conflict between recovering whale populations and emerging industrial interests.

The vertical distribution and developmental stage composition of Rhincalanus gigas, Calanoides acutus, Calanus propinquus and krill, Euphausia superba larvae, were a good index for a general assessment of the seasonal condition of the plankton communities. There were five zones differing in seasonal situation: (1) The Polar Front and the southern ACC (not studied in detail), (2) The Weddell Front, (3) The Weddell Gyre interior, (4) The Maud Rise area, and (5) The Coastal Current zone. In the Weddell Front, the planktonic community resembled an autumnal situation with moderate phytoplankton biomass; the overwintering stock of copepods was not completely formed and the occurrence of calyptopes larvae of E. superba indicated that krill continued to reproduce until May. In the Weddell Gyre interior, a typical winter plankton community was found even before sea ice had formed. The specific hydrographic regime of the Maud Rise (governed by the mesoscale circulation over the seamount) support the late autumn conditions similar to the Weddell Front (but without early krill larvae). The plankton of the Coastal Current was a winter community. We conclude that in the eastern part of the Weddell Front (compared to the western part) seasonal development of both phytoplankton and herbivorous zooplankton is delayed in spring but prolonged in late autumn. Furthermore, it appears that the Weddell Sea ecosystem exhibits a much higher degree of spatial and temporal variability than thought before. This may have an impact on seasonal pattern of organic carbon transport from the pelagic realm to deeper water layers and to the sediment.

They have proven to be a valuable method of defining food web relationships, trophic positioning, and the dietary behaviors of marine species. The endemic krill species of the Humboldt Current System (HCS), Euphausia mucronata, is the most abundant krill species over the continental shelf, usually associated with coastal upwelling zones. This study aimed to quantify the changes in the FA composition of E. mucronata in the coastal upwelling zone off Dichato in central Chile concerning the phytoplankton community and environmental variability. We hypothesized that E. mucronata changes its FA composition according to the functional species groups that structure the phytoplankton community as well as environmental variability. Krill, phytoplankton, and environmental datasets were analyzed using multivariate analyses, considering samplings from January 2013 to August 2014. The total concentration of FAs was 550.5 ng/g (n = 42) of which the 77% corresponded to six FAs: palmitoleic acid (16:1n7), palmitic acid (16:0), vaccenic acid (18:1), oleic acid (18:1n7), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA, 20:5n3) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, 22:6n3). FA composition did not change according to neither the season nor sampling date. Seasonal changes were observed in both community structure of the phytoplankton (i.e. species composition and functional groups) and sea temperature. EPA/DHA ratio, PUFA/SFA ratio and carnivory variability were seasonally different suggesting that E. mucronata had mostly a diatom-based herbivorous habit during austral spring and summer and, it could have omnivore or carnivore habits during austral autumn and winter. Diatom and ciliate abundances and, sea temperature were the best predictor variables explaining 64% of the total variation in the FA composition. This study suggests that, despite seasonal environmental variation (biotic and abiotic), this krill species fed mainly diatoms and could shift its trophic habit to carnivory according to season of the year.

The deduced amino acid sequence from ORF-1 shared significant similarity with the plasmid replicase protein of Psychrobacter cryohalolentis, strain K5. The DNA region immediately downstream of the ORF-1 showed some homology with the Rep-binding sequence of the theta-replicating CoIE2-type plasmids. The ORF-3 amino acid sequence revealed amino acid sequence homology with the mobilization protein of Psychrobacter sp. PRwf-1 and Moraxella catarrhalis, with identities of 28% and 25%, respectively. The ORF-4 showed 46% amino acid sequence homology with the putative relaxase/mobilization nuclease MobA of Hafnia alvei and 44% homology with the putative mobilization protein A of Pasterulla multocida. The copy number of pKW1 in Pseudoalteromonas sp. 643A was estimated of 15 copies per chromosome. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

Weight loss during breeding is adaptive for female macaroni penguins, Eudyptes chrysolophus	EVOLUTIONARY ECOLOGY RESEARCH												Question: How does the female macaroni penguin balance her own needs with those of her chick during breeding? Features of the model: We model the behaviour of female macaroni penguins during a sensitive life-history stage as a function of the availability of their main prey species, Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba), using stochastic dynamic programming. In the model, females maximize accumulated delivery to the chick, accounting for metabolic losses. Chick fullness is included as a state in the model. Range of key variables: We test three scenarios for krill availability, which changes with distance from the nest. In the first, krill abundance increases with distance from the nest, with no variability in the reward at each distance. In the second, variability increases proportionally with the increasing amount of krill available at each distance from the nest. In the third, the abundance of krill at each distance from the nest is constant, but variability decreases further from the nest. Conclusions: Natural selection should produce females that sacrifice their own condition to meet the increasing demands of their chicks. We predict a weight loss of 10-20%, which is comparable to the empirical average of 14%. We also predict that females will endure the cost of travelling further from the nest to obtain a more predictable meal of krill, even if the mean reward does not change with distance from the nest.																	1522-0613	1937-3791				NOV	2007	9	7					1053	1076									WOS:000251194600001

Variability of Salpa thompsoni population structure in the Drake Passage in summer season 2010	POLISH POLAR RESEARCH												Dynamic climate changes have become noticeable in recent decades, especially in the vulnerable region of the West Antarctic. The relatively simple food web of this area relies on krill - Euphausia superba. Presumably, as a result of climatic fluctuations, a decrease in the number of this crustacean has been recorded, followed by an increase in the population of the gelatinous zooplankter Salpa thompsoni. In the research presented herein, population and morphometric analyses of Salpa thompsoni have been conducted. Specimens for this research were collected from the Drake Passage, using a Bongo net in the summer season of 2010. It has been found that the horizontal distribution of this gelatinous zooplankter was significantly irregular (Kruskal-Wallis test, p<0.001). In the northern part of the investigated area, both blastozooids and oozooids were recorded, which confirms the dynamic development of this species. The central part of the Drake Passage was characterized by the dominance of blastozooids, with embryos found at different stages of the development. Only in the region of the South Shetland Islands, the salpid population was characterized by reduced or even stopped reproduction. The immense reproductive efficiency observed in the Salpa thompsoni population was mostly induced by the favourable thermal conditions. These observations may suggest that the ongoing climat changes in the West Antarctic will promote the population expansion of this species.

J	Robison, BH				Robison, BH			What drives the diel vertical migrations of Antarctic midwater fish?	JOURNAL OF THE MARINE BIOLOGICAL ASSOCIATION OF THE UNITED KINGDOM												Like their counterparts at lower latitudes, many Antarctic midwater fish make extensive, diel vertical migrations. However, Antarctic species make these migrations in the absence of two of the three selective advantages generally ascribed to this behaviour. Because the water column is nearly isothermal, there is no metabolic bonus to be gained from thermal differences in habitat depth. Likewise, because their prey do not perform significant vertical migrations, the fish migrations act to diminish rather than enhance their feeding opportunities. For Antarctic midwater fish, the sole advantage of these migrations appears to be the avoidance of visually-cued predators in the upper part of the water column. An evaluation of the relative importance of the three selective factors supports the suggestion that predator avoidance may also be the principal driver of diel vertical migrations for midwater fish at lower latitudes.																	0025-3154					JUN	2003	83	3					639	642		10.1017/S0025315403007586h							WOS:000182915100030

Environmental determinants of top predator distribution within the dynamic winter pack ice zone of the northern Antarctic Peninsula	POLAR BIOLOGY												Global warming is predicted to reduce the amount of sea ice concentration in polar environments, thus presenting profound changes for populations of seabirds and marine mammals dependent on sea ice. Using data from a shipboard survey during August 2012, I test the hypothesis that relative abundance of seabird and marine mammals reflects environmental variability associated with the dynamic pack ice zone. Using environmental data and observations of sea ice concentration, I quantified an environmental gradient that describes the spatial organization of the dynamic pack ice zone. The relationship of top predators to this environmental gradient revealed three important aspects: (1) an open water and pack ice community is present with some top predator species exhibiting higher abundance associated with moderate sea ice concentration (40-60 %) as opposed to the pack ice edge (10 %), (2) Antarctic fur seals (Arctocephalus gazella) were the most abundant pinniped and they were observed resting on ice floes and foraging within leads and polynyas, and (3) for the most abundant species, spatial regression models indicate that latitude and sea ice concentration (a principal north/south gradient) are the most important environmental determinants. Winter ocean conditions may strongly influence population dynamics of top predators; therefore, information regarding their habitat use during winter is needed for understanding ecosystem dynamics.																	0722-4060	1432-2056				AUG	2014	37	8					1083	1097		10.1007/s00300-014-1502-1							WOS:000341378000003						
J	ABELMANN, A				ABELMANN, A			RADIOLARIAN FLUX IN ANTARCTIC WATERS (DRAKE PASSAGE, POWELL BASIN, BRANSFIELD STRAIT)	POLAR BIOLOGY												The study of radiolarians collected during sediment trap experiments in the Drake Passage, the northern Powell Basin, and the King George Basin of the Bransfield Strait provides new information on the fluxes of radiolarian shells in Antarctic waters, on the annual flux pattern, the species distribution and its ecological significance, and on alteration processes of the radiolarian shells in the water column and at the sediment/water interface. A 28-month monitoring with time-series sediment traps in the Bransfield Strait indicates an annual flux pattern characterized by short-term flux pulses during austral summer, which reach daily fluxes of up to 5 x 10(3) shells m-2 and which account for more than 90% of the total annual flux. The distinct seasonal variations are linked to variations in the sea ice coverage. Other controlling factors are the production of phytoplankton and the impact by zooplankton grazers, e.g., krill. During the summer flux pulses the vertical fluxes of radiolarians range between ca. 3 and 21 x 10(4) shells m-2, values that are one or more orders of magnitudes lower than fluxes observed at sites in the tropical and northern high-latitude ocean. Significant lateral transport of radiolarians was documented during the austral summer in the Bransfield Strait by a factor of 10 increase of the radiolarian flux in the lower portion of the water column and the species composition trapped in deeper waters. Radiolarian assemblages associated with pelagic and neritic environments characterized by typical Antarctic taxa (Antarctissa spp.) and a group of species with bipolar distribution (e.g. Plectacantha oikiskos, Phormacantha hystrix), respectively, are distinguished. While the signal of polycystine radiolarians is relatively well recorded in the sediments, the shells of phaeodarians, which were observed at fluxes of up to 1 x 10(3) shells m-2 day-1 in the upper portion of the water column, are almost completely dissolved during settling through the water column.

Quantifying how Antarctic predators respond to such changes provides the context for predicting how climate variability/change will affect these assemblages into the future. Over an 11-year time-series, we examine how inter-annual variability in sea ice concentration and advance affect the foraging behaviour of a top Antarctic predator, the southern elephant seal. Females foraged longer in pack ice in years with greatest sea ice concentration and earliest sea ice advance, while males foraged longer in polynyas in years of lowest sea ice concentration. There was a positive relationship between near-surface meridional wind anomalies and female foraging effort, but not for males. This study reveals the complexities of foraging responses to climate forcing by a poleward migratory predator through varying sea ice property and dynamic anomalies.

J	Dunton, KH				Dunton, KH			delta N-15 and delta C-13 measurements of Antarctic peninsula fauna: Trophic relationships and assimilation of benthic seaweeds	AMERICAN ZOOLOGIST					Annual Meeting of the Society-for-Comparative-and Integrative-Biology	JAN 04-08, 2000	ATLANTA, GEORGIA	Soc Comparat & Integrat Biol				Measurements of delta C-13, delta N-15, and C/N for a variety of Antarctic peninsula fauna and flora were used to quantify the importance of benthic brown algae to resident organisms and determine food web relationships among this diverse littoral fauna. delta C-13 values ranged from -16.8 parts per thousand for benthic algal herbivores (limpets) to -29.8 parts per thousand for the krill, Euphausia superba; the average pooled value for brown macroalgae, including their attached filamentous diatoms, was-20.6 parts per thousand. There was no correlation between biomass delta C-13 or delta N-15 with ON content, and consequently both 6(13)C and delta N-15 values were useful in evaluating trophic relationships. delta N-15 values of the fauna ranged from 3.1 to 12.5 parts per thousand, with lowest values recorded in suspension feeders (e.g., bryozoans) and highest values in Adelie penguins (12.5 parts per thousand) collected in 1989. The comparatively lower delta N-15 value for a Chinstrap penguin (6.9 parts per thousand) collected in 1997 is attributed to the different dietary food sources consumed by these species as reflected in their respective delta C-13 values. Significant amounts of benthic macroalgal carbon Is incorporated into the tissues of invertebrates and fishes that occupy up to four trophic levels. For many benthic and epibenthic species, including various crustaceans and molluscs, assimilation of benthic algal carbon through detrital pathways ranges from 30 to 100%. Consequently, the trophic Importance of benthic brown algae may well extend to many pelagic organisms that are key prey species for birds, fishes, and marine mammals. These data support the hypothesis that benthic seaweeeds, together with their associated epiphytic diatoms, provide an important carbon source that is readily incorporated Into Antarctic peninsula food webs.																	0003-1569					FEB	2001	41	1					99	112		10.1668/0003-1569(2001)041[0099:NACMOA]2.0.CO;2							WOS:000172505600009

Cycles of Euphausia superba recruitment evident in the diet of Pygoscelid penguins and net trawls in the South Shetland Islands, Antarctica	POLAR BIOLOGY												Size and sex of Antarctic krill taken from chinstrap and gentoo penguin diet were compared to those from scientific net surveys in the South Shetland Islands from 1998 to 2006 in order to evaluate penguin diet as a sampling mechanism and to look at trends in krill populations. Both penguin diet and net samples revealed a 4-5 year cycle in krill recruitment with one or two strong cohorts sustaining the population during each cycle. Penguin diet samples contained adult krill of similar lengths to those caught in nets; however, penguins rarely took juvenile krill. Penguin diet samples contained proportionately more females when the krill population was dominated by large adults at the end of the cycles; net samples showed greater proportions of males in these years. These patterns are comparable to those reported elsewhere in the region and are likely driven by the availability of different sizes and sexes of krill in relation to the colony.																	0722-4060	1432-2056				NOV	2007	30	12					1615	1623		10.1007/s00300-007-0326-7							WOS:000249920800012						
J	Albessard, E; Mayzaud, P				Albessard, E; Mayzaud, P			Influence of tropho-climatic environment and reproduction on lipid composition of the euphausiid Meganyctiphanes norvegica in the Ligurian Sea, the Clyde Sea and the Kattegat	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												Lipid content and lipid-class distribution in the northern krill Meganyctiphanes norvegica (M. Sars, 1857) was investigated in 3 contrasting (in terms of climatic and trophic conditions) areas: the Ligurian Sea, the Clyde Sea and the Kattegat. Seasonal differences in the lipid content of krill were closely related to food supply coupled with the krill reproductive state in both the Ligurian Sea and in the Clyde Sea. In the Kattegat, the lipid reserves of reproductive krill were low and probably used continuously over a longer reproduction period and successive spawning cycles. In the Ligurian and Clyde Seas, female krill lost 55 and 33% of their cephalothorax (CT) lipids through spawning. The content of triacylglycerol (TAG) and phosphatidylcholine (PC), both major lipids in the CT, were higher when food conditions were optimal at the 3 sites, and were correlated to chlorophyll a (chl a) concentration in the Ligurian and Clyde Seas. The influence of reproduction on lipid-class distribution in the Clyde and Ligurian Seas was expressed by a large decrease in PC and TAG throughout spawning, while in the Kattegat PC and TAG levels were low irrespective of the reproductive state. The relative influence of environmental and physiological factors on the lipid distribution of krill in the CT and abdomen (AB) among the 3 locations was evaluated using principal components analysis. In the CT, TAG and PC along with minor lipids were major discriminating factors and were strongly correlated to total lipid content and chl a concentrations. For reproducive krill, marked differences in the CT and AB indicated covariation between reproduction and trophic conditions. The influence of the physical environment on M. norvegica at sexual rest found expression in variation in the membrane lipids in the AB across the different temperature and salinity regimes at the 3 sites. The results are discussed in terms of adaptive mechanisms involving lipid distribution and metabolism developed by the species.																	0171-8630	1616-1599					2003	253						217	232		10.3354/meps253217							WOS:000183487200020

Wideband (15-260 kHz) acoustic volume backscattering spectra of Northern krill (Meganyctiphanes norvegica) and butterfish (Peprilus triacanthus)	ICES JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE												Measurements of acoustic backscatter made over a wide frequency band have the potential for improved classification relative to traditional narrowband methods, by characterizing more fully the frequency response of scatterers. In January 2014, five wideband transceivers [Simrad EK80 Wideband Transceivers (WBTs)] and split-beam transducers with nominal centre frequencies of 18, 38, 70, 120, and 200 kHz were used to collect acoustic data spanning a nearly continuous 15-260 kHz bandwidth. The acoustic samples were from ca. 2 m below the surface to the seabed in an area along the US continental shelf break. Bottom trawls and zooplankton nets were also used to sample scatterers contributing to selected features of the acoustic backscatter. Measurements of frequency-dependent volume backscattering strength (i.e. volume backscattering spectra) from aggregations of euphausiids (mostly Northern krill, Meganyctiphanes norvegica) clearly resolved the transition from Rayleigh to geometric scattering, consistent with modelled backscatter from the type and length of animals sampled with bongo nets. Volume backscattering spectra from aggregations dominated by butterfish (Peprilus triacanthus) revealed a frequency response that was suggestive of superimposed scattering by soft tissue and bone. Backscatter predicted by Kirchhoff ray mode models of butterfish corresponded to trends in the measured spectra, supporting the assumption that acoustic scattering by butterfish is dominated by soft tissue and vertebrae.																	1054-3139	1095-9289				SEP-OCT	2017	74	8					2249	2261		10.1093/icesjms/fsx050							WOS:000412707000018

This study investigated the effects of ultrasound pretreatment on the structural and functional properties of chickpea protein isolate (CPI) and its binding interaction with ginseng saponin (GS). Ultrasound pretreatment induced the unfolding of CPI and promoted the binding affinity of CPI to GS, which was confirmed by fluorescence spectroscopy. Circular dichroism spectra demonstrated that the addition of GS increased the alpha-helix content by 11.20% and reduced the 8-sheet, 8-turn and random coil content by 3.70%, 1.30% and 6.00%, respectively. Compared with the U0-GS complex, the U15-GS complex stabilized emulsions showed higher (P < 0.05) oxidative stability that the PV and TBARS values decreased by 101.81 and 8.88 mg/L, respectively. Moreover, ultrasound pretreatment significantly increased the interfacial adsorption of GS, antioxidant activity of CPI-GS complexes and the retention rate of astaxanthin, which accounted for the improved oxidative stability of emulsions. Generally, ultrasound was successfully applied to design emulsions with improved stability and nutritional properties in food systems.																	0023-6438	1096-1127				SEP	2021	149								111803	10.1016/j.lwt.2021.111803							WOS:000675883500006

Short-term grazing estimates are calculated by integrating (1) theoretical and experimental estimates of ingestion rates in response to the standing stock of phytoplankton, and (2) field measurements of phytoplankton standing stock and grazer biomass. Field data come from three austral summer cruises (January/February of 1993, 1994, and 1995) and one sequence of seasonal cruises (summer, fall and winter 1993). The relative and absolute abundance of the dominant macrozooplankton grazers, Euphausia superba and Salpa thompsoni, varied by at least an order of magnitude on the spatial and temporal scales observed. Mean grazing rates ranged from 0.4 to 9.0 mu g chlorophyll m(-2) h(-1) for the Antarctic krill and salp populations over the three summer cruises. This leads to variability in the flow of carbon from the primary producers through the grazers on the same scales. Temporal and spatial variability in grazing impact and faecal pellet production are high.																	0924-7963					NOV	1998	17	1-4					261	273		10.1016/S0924-7963(98)00042-6							WOS:000077463500018

Fifty nine species of Mysidacea (Crustacea, Peracarida) are now known. Of these, 37 were reported for the Antarctic region and 31 for the Magellan region; six species occur further north in the Southern Ocean, but south of 40 degrees S. 51% of the Antarctic Mysidacea are endemic, and the figure for the Magellan region is 48%. Most of the species live hyperbenthically, but some also occur bathy- or mesopelagically. Mysidetes has the most species in the Southern Ocean, and Eucopia australis is the species with the widest bathymetric distribution (600-6000 m depth). It is concluded that an emergence of species onto the Antarctic shelf in the Neogene was quite unlikely, because none of the mysid species is a true deepsea species, and most species occur on the shelf or at the shelf break. It is more probable that present day species colonized the Southern Ocean via shallower waters. The examples of the distribution of different genera suggest that the Mysidacea of the Southern Ocean probably had various geographical origins.

Roy			Extreme anomalous atmospheric circulation in the West Antarctic Peninsula region in Austral Spring and Summer 2001/02, and its profound impact on sea ice and biota	JOURNAL OF CLIMATE												Exceptional sea ice conditions occurred in the West Antarctic Peninsula (WAP) region from September 2001 to February 2002, resulting from a strongly positive atmospheric pressure anomaly in the South Atlantic coupled with strong negative anomalies in the Bellingshausen - Amundsen and southwest Weddell Seas. This created a strong and persistent north-northwesterly flow of mild and moist air across the WAP. In situ, satellite, and NCEP - NCAR Reanalysis (NNR) data are used to examine the profound and complex impact on regional sea ice, oceanography, and biota. Extensive sea ice melt, leading to an ocean mixed layer freshening and widespread ice surface flooding, snow - ice formation, and phytoplankton growth, coincided with extreme ice deformation and dynamic thickening. Sea ice dynamics were crucial to the development of an unusually early and rapid ( short) retreat season ( negative ice extent anomaly). Strong winds with a dominant northerly component created an unusually compact marginal ice zone and a major increase in ice thickness by deformation and over-rafting. This led to the atypical persistence of highly compact coastal ice through summer. Ecological effects were both positive and negative, the latter including an impact on the growth rate of larval Antarctic krill and the largest recorded between-season breeding population decrease and lowest reproductive success in a 30-yr Adelie penguin demographic time series. The unusual sea ice and snow cover conditions also contributed to the formation of a major phytoplankton bloom. Unexpectedly, the initial bloom occurred within compact sea ice and could not be detected in Sea-Viewing Wide Field-of-View Sensor (SeaWiFS) ocean color data. This analysis demonstrates that sea ice extent alone is an inadequate descriptor of the regional sea ice state/conditions, from both a climatic and ecological perspective; further information is required on thickness and dynamics/deformation.

Transcriptome and Peptidome Characterisation of the Main Neuropeptides and Peptidic Hormones of a Euphausiid: The Ice Krill, Euphausia crystallorophias	PLOS ONE												Background: The Ice krill, Euphausia crystallorophias is one of the species at the base of the Southern Ocean food chain. Given their significant contribution to the biomass of the Southern Ocean, it is vitally important to gain a better understanding of their physiology and, in particular, anticipate their responses to climate change effects in the warming seas around Antarctica. Methodology/Principal Findings: Illumina sequencing was used to produce a transcriptome of the ice krill. Analysis of the assembled contigs via two different methods, produced 36 new pre-pro-peptides, coding for 61 neuropeptides or peptide hormones belonging to the following families: Allatostatins (A, B et C), Bursicon (alpha and beta), Crustacean Hyperglycemic Hormones (CHH and MIH/VIHs), Crustacean Cardioactive Peptide (CCAP), Corazonin, Diuretic Hormones (DH), the Eclosion Hormone (EH), Neuroparsin, Neuropeptide F (NPF), small Neuropeptide F (sNPF), Pigment Dispersing Hormone (PDH), Red Pigment Concentrating Hormone (RPCH) and finally Tachykinin. LC/MS/MS proteomics was also carried out on eyestalk extracts, which are the major site of neuropeptide synthesis in decapod crustaceans. Results confirmed the presence of six neuropeptides and six precursor-related peptides previously identified in the transcriptome analyses. Conclusions: This study represents the first comprehensive analysis of neuropeptide hormones in a Eucarida non-decapod Malacostraca, several of which are described for the first time in a non-decapod crustacean. Additionally, there is a potential expansion of PDH and Neuropeptide F family members, which may reflect certain life history traits such as circadian rhythms associated with diurnal migrations and also the confirmation via mass spectrometry of several novel pre-propeptides, of unknown function. Knowledge of these essential hormones provides a vital framework for understanding the physiological response of this key Southern Ocean species to climate change and provides a valuable resource for studies into the molecular phylogeny of these organisms and the evolution of neuropeptide hormones.				corre, erwan/O-4669-2019; Clark, Melody S/D-7371-2014	corre, erwan/0000-0001-6354-2278; Clark, Melody S/0000-0002-3442-3824; Thorne, Michael/0000-0001-7759-612X												1932-6203					AUG 21	2013	8	8							e71609	10.1371/journal.pone.0071609							WOS:000324470100050	23990964

Morphological and ecological evidence for two sympatric forms of Type B killer whale around the Antarctic Peninsula	POLAR BIOLOGY												Killer whales (Orcinus orca) are apex marine predators in Antarctica, but uncertainty over their taxonomic and ecological diversity constrains evaluations of their trophic interactions. We describe two distinct, sympatric forms sharing the characteristic pigmentation of Type B, the most common around the Antarctic Peninsula. Laser photogrammetry revealed nonoverlapping size differences among adults: Based on a body length index (BLI: blowhole to dorsal fin) adult females of the larger form ("B1") were 20 % longer than the smaller form ("B2"), and adult males were 24 % longer on average. Dorsal fins of B1 adult females were 19 % taller than B2 females, and adult males 32 % taller. Both types were strongly sexually dimorphic, but B1 more so, including for BLI (B1 males = 1.07x females; B2 = 1.05x) and especially for dorsal fin height (B1 male fins = 2.33x female; B2 = 2.10x). The characteristically large Type B eye patch was more extensive for B1 than B2, comprising 41 and 37 % of BLI, respectively. Average group size was also significantly different, with B1s in smaller groups (mean 7, range 1-14) and B2s more gregarious (mean 36, range 8-75). Stable isotope analysis of skin biopsies indicated dietary differences: a significantly lower nitrogen N-15/N-14 ratio in B2s supported observations of feeding primarily on krill consumers (e.g., pygoscelid penguins), while B1s prey mainly on predators of krill consumers (e.g., Weddell seals Leptonychotes weddellii). These differences likely represent adaptations to distinct foraging niches, which has led to genetic divergence; their ecology now needs further study.																	0722-4060	1432-2056				JAN	2017	40	1					231	236		10.1007/s00300-016-1942-x							WOS:000391401900020						
J	BOYD, IL; REID, K; BEVAN, RM				BOYD, IL; REID, K; BEVAN, RM			SWIMMING SPEED AND ALLOCATION OF TIME DURING THE DIVE CYCLE IN ANTARCTIC FUR SEALS	ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR												During sustained bouts of diving, predators such as fur seals may adjust the time they spend diving to maximize the time they can spend foraging and minimize the time spent at the surface between dives. To examine this, swimming speeds and the time allocated to different parts of the dive cycle were measured in 10 adult female Antarctic fur seals, Arctocephalus gazella, while they were foraging at sea. Mean swimming speeds during diving ranged from 1.32 to 1.99 m/s and 90% of diving swimming speeds within individuals were between 1 and 2.5 m/s. This represented a narrower range of speed than was exhibited by animals when swimming at the surface. Swimming speeds were fastest during the descent and ascent phases of dives with a reduction in speed near the bottom of the dive, when the seals were assumed to be feeding on krill. Time spent at the surface increased as a curvilinear function of dive duration and was influenced by diving swimming speed. This relationship was, on average, close to that predicted by a model (Houston & Carbone 1992, Behav. Ecol, 3, 255-265) which suggested that the metabolic rate was greatest during the foraging phase of dives (5.9 times predicted BMR) than during the ascent or descent (3.6 times predicted BMR). Deep diving (>30 m) and high swim speeds also incurred costs in terms of reduced foraging time and may explain why mean dive depths for individuals were within the range of 12-33 m. These data broadly support the predictions of models of diving behaviour based on balancing the supply of, and demand for, oxygen and the principle that fur seals are attempting to maximize the time they spend within the foraging area.

J	AINLEY, DG; RIBIC, CA; FRASER, WR				AINLEY, DG; RIBIC, CA; FRASER, WR			DOES PREY PREFERENCE AFFECT HABITAT CHOICE IN ANTARCTIC SEABIRDS	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												Diet composition of the members of 2 seabird species assemblages in the Scotia-Weddell Confluence region, Antarctica, was investigated during 3 seasons/years: spring 1983, autumn 1986, and winter 1988. One assemblage frequented the pack ice and the other was present in adjacent open waters; most members of the latter species assemblage vacated the Antarctic during winter. We sought answers to 2 questions: (1) Did the 2 species assemblages depend on food webs that differed substantially; and (2) Was there a trophic basis to explain why the pack-ice assemblage did not expand into the open water left vacant by the other during winter? To test an a priori hypothesis that diet was affected by habitat, diet samples were obtained from birds encountered in 3 habitats: open water, sparse concentrations of ice, and heavy ice cover. Cluster analysis showed broad overlap in seabird diet regardless of species, habitat (ice/water mass) or year. Seabirds exploited prey largely according to ranked availability, although they appeared to choose the larger fish and crustaceans over smaller crustaceans. Myctophids in particular, but also krill and squid, were the main prey groups. Diets did not separate on the basis of predator/prey size to any appreciable degree even though a 1000-fold difference in predator size existed. Feeding success, as indicated by fullness of stomach, of the members of the 2 species assemblages was highest when in their respective usual habitats. We conclude that open-water seabirds lack the specialized foraging behaviors required to exploit the pack-ice environment that open waters during the winter offer much poorer feeding conditions than those of the pack ice.																	0171-8630					DEC	1992	90	3					207	221		10.3354/meps090207							WOS:A1992KN49200001

The maximum enzyme synthesis (lactose as a sufficient inducer) was observed at 6 degreesC, thus below the optimum growth temperature of the bacterium (15 degreesC). The enzyme extracted from cells was purified to homogeneity (25% recovery) by using the fast, three-step procedure, including affinity chromatography on PABTG-Sepharose. The enzyme is a tetramer composed of roughly 115 kDa subunits. It is maximally active at 40 degreesC (190 U mg(-1) of protein) and pH 6.0-8.0. PNPG is its preferred substrate (50% higher activity than against ONPG). The Pseudoalteromonas sp. 22b beta-galactosidase is activated by thiol compounds (70% rise in activity in the presence of 10 mM dithiotreitol), some metal ions (K+, Na+, Mn2+-40% increase, Mg2+-15% enhancement), and markedly inactivated by pCMB and heavy metal ions, particularly Cu2+. Noteworthy, Ca2+ ions do not affect the enzyme activity, and the homogeneous protein is stable at 4 degreesC for at least 30 days without any stabilizers. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

Stomach contents from 2239 C. gunnari (130-560 mm total length) were examined. A bootstrapping technique was used to calculate confidence intervals for an index of relative importance of prey categories (% IRIDC). Diet varied significantly between years and age classes but there was little regional difference in diet. In general, diet was dominated by krill, Euphausia superba and by the amphipod Themisto gaudichaudii. Smaller (younger) fish tended to prey on a higher proportion of T. gaudichaudii and small euphausiids such as Thysanoessa sp. and took smaller quantities of E. superba. In a season of poor krill availability (summer of 2003-2004) the proportion of krill in the diet, stomach fullness and fish condition (indicated by length-weight relationships) were significantly lower than in the other summer seasons. A large reduction (> 80%) in the estimated annual (2005) biomass of the C. gunnari stock directly followed the season of poor krill availability. This decline was largely because of mortality of 2+ and 3+ fish, which were more krill dependent than 1+ fish. Younger fish appear to have survived, leading to an increase in the estimated population biomass in 2006.

The majority of the energy in the soft body tissues was attributable to NaOH-soluble protein (17.4% dry wt) and in the shell to lipid (2.6% dry wt). An intact individual with a shell length of 3.4 cm and a wet and dry wt of 5.8 and 2.9 g, respectively, contained a total of 9.6 kJ. As dense populations of L. uva occur in the Southern Ocean, this species represents a considerable potential energy resource for predators, including sea stars and fish (ca 10(3) kJ . m-2 in some areas). Total crude extracts of whole brachiopod soft tissues caused significant retraction of sensory tube-feet in 6 species of sympatric sea stars. Control assays employing whole crude extracts of the fresh soft tissues of the antarctic limpet Nacella concinna (Strebel, 1908) or seawater alone did not elicit significant sustained tube-foot retraction. Bioactivity was diminished in frozen extracts of brachiopod soft tissues exposed to the sensory tube-feet of the sea star Odontaster validus (Koehler, 1906), but was not diminished in the tube-foot retraction response of the sea star Neosmilaster georgianus (Studer, 1885). Lyophilized brachiopod soft tissues ground into a fine powder and embedded at a concentration of 2% (wt:vol) in agar pellets containing 5% krill caused significant feeding deterrence in an allopatric fish (the sheepshead minnow Cyprinidon variegatus Lacepede 1803). These findings suggest that, similar to temperate zone and tropical brachiopods, body tissues of this antarctic brachiopod are unpalatable to potential predators.																	0022-0981						1993	169	1					103	116		10.1016/0022-0981(93)90046-Q							WOS:A1993LK85800008

Mesozooplankton abundance and biomass were highest at the polar front and south of the front. Biomass increased by 1.5-2-times during the course of the study. Calanoides acutus, Calanus propinquus, C. simillimus, Rhincalanus gigas and Neocalanus tonsus were the dominant large copepods found in the study. Oithona spp and pteropods were numerically important components of the zooplankton community. The copepod and juvenile krill community consumed 1-7% of the daily chlorophyll standing stock, equivalent to 3-21% of the daily phytoplankton production. There was an increased grazing pressure at night due to both increased gut pigment concentrations as well as increases in zooplankton numbers. Phytoplankton carbon contributed a significant fraction (> 50%) of the dietary carbon for the copepods during spring and summer. The relative importance of phytoplankton carbon to the diet increased south of the polar front, suggested that grazing by copepods could be important to organic carbon and biogenic silica flux south of the polar front.

Utilising IPCC assessments to support the ecosystem approach to fisheries management within a warming Southern Ocean	MARINE POLICY												Southern Ocean marine ecosystems are highly vulnerable to climate-driven change, the impacts of which must be factored into conservation and management. The Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR) is aware of the urgent need to develop climate-responsive options within its ecosystem approach to management. However, limited capacity as well as political differences have meant that little progress has been made. Strengthening scientific information flow to inform CCAMLR's decision-making on climate change may help to remove some of these barriers. On this basis, this study encourages the utilisation of outputs from the United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). The IPCC's 2019 Special Report on the Ocean and Cryosphere in a Changing Climate (SROCC) constitutes the most rigorous and up-todate assessment of how oceans and the cryosphere are changing, how they are projected to change, and the consequences of those changes, together with a range of response options. To assist CCAMLR to focus on what is most useful from this extensive global report, SROCC findings that have specific relevance to the management of Southern Ocean ecosystems are extracted and summarised here. These findings are translated into recommendations to CCAMLR, emphasising the need to reduce and manage the risks that climate change presents to harvested species and the wider ecosystem of which they are part. Improved linkages between IPCC, CCAMLR and other relevant bodies may help overcome existing impediments to progress, enabling climate change to become fully integrated into CCAMLR's policy and decision-making.

This model combines laboratory measurements of temperature effects on developmental times, density and physiology of krill embryos and larvae and the observed water temperature structure in the Bransfield Strait-South Shetland Islands region. Simulations with observed vertical temperature profiles from this region show that embryos that develop at temperatures less than 0-degrees-C hatch relatively deep (almost-equal-to 1000 m) or hit the bottom before hatching. The presence of warm (1-2-degrees-C) Circumpolar Deep Water (CDW), between 200 and 700 m, results in hatching depths of about 700 m. The sinking rate pattern characteristic of the embryos of Euphausia superba retains the embryos in the CDW, where development is accelerated. Larval ascent rate through the CDW is rapid, so larvae reach the surface before metamorphosing into the first feeding stage, and have sufficient carbon reserves to drift at the surface for several weeks before needing to find food. These results suggest that the sinking rate pattern characteristic of embryos of Antarctic krill may be part of a reproductive strategy that evolved in response to the thermal structure of its environment. The complementary component of this reproductive strategy is the observed correlation between the distribution of krill schools containing reproducing individuals and the presence of CDW. With this reproductive strategy, the spawning regions of Antarctic krill are in areas where oceanic conditions enhance the probability of survival of its embryos and non-feeding larvae.																	0198-0149					JUL-AUG	1992	39	7-8A					1177	1200		10.1016/0198-0149(92)90063-Y							WOS:A1992JH54000008

Effect of prey type on the fine-scale feeding behaviour of migrating east Australian humpback whales	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												For terrestrial migrants, feeding at migratory stopover sites is important, with prey quality linked to future survival and reproductive success. In contrast, the importance of this behaviour to marine species is unknown. The humpback whale Megaptera novaeangliae is a marine migrant that is thought to fast while migrating; however, recent studies suggest that feeding may occur during this time. The aims of this study were to determine how the prey type available on a migratory route off Eden, New South Wales, Australia, influenced whether whales fed or not, and to study the fine-scale behaviour of the whales. Digital acoustic recording tags (DTAGs) and focal follows were used to record whale behaviour. A larger proportion of groups were determined to be feeding when krill was observed at the surface. Whales encountering fish spent a small percentage (28%) of time feeding, behaving similarly to non-feeding whales on migration, with small groups, a higher proportion of males sampled, and relatively straight tracks. In contrast, whales encountering surface swarms of krill spent significantly more time feeding (92%) and behaved similarly to whales on feeding grounds, with larger groups, more females sampled, and tracks with high turning angles. Therefore, changes in the available prey type influenced the amount of time spent feeding and the social dynamics of groups. Given the link between the amount of feeding completed on migration and the future survival and reproductive success of individuals in terrestrial species, the impact of such fluctuations on marine species such as the humpback whale deserves more attention.

Megafaunal Communities in Rapidly Warming Fjords along the West Antarctic Peninsula: Hotspots of Abundance and Beta Diversity	PLOS ONE												Glacio-marine fjords occur widely at high latitudes and have been extensively studied in the Arctic, where heavy meltwater inputs and sedimentation yield low benthic faunal abundance and biodiversity in inner-middle fjords. Fjord benthic ecosystems remain poorly studied in the subpolar Antarctic, including those in extensive fjords along the West Antarctic Peninsula (WAP). Here we test ecosystem predictions from Arctic fjords on three subpolar, glacio-marine fjords along the WAP. With seafloor photographic surveys we evaluate benthic megafaunal abundance, community structure, and species diversity, as well as the abundance of demersal nekton and macroalgal detritus, in soft-sediment basins of Andvord, Flandres and Barilari Bays at depths of 436-725 m. We then contrast these fjord sites with three open shelf stations of similar depths. Contrary to Arctic predictions, WAP fjord basins exhibited 3 to 38-fold greater benthic megafaunal abundance than the open shelf, and local species diversity and trophic complexity remained high from outer to inner fjord basins. Furthermore, WAP fjords contained distinct species composition, substantially contributing to beta and gamma diversity at 400-700 m depths along the WAP. The abundance of demersal nekton and macroalgal detritus was also substantially higher in WAP fjords compared to the open shelf. We conclude that WAP fjords are important hotspots of benthic abundance and biodiversity as a consequence of weak meltwater influences, low sedimentation disturbance, and high, varied food inputs. We postulate that WAP fjords differ markedly from their Arctic counterparts because they are in earlier stages of climate warming, and that rapid warming along the WAP will increase meltwater and sediment inputs, deleteriously impacting these biodiversity hotspots. Because WAP fjords also provide important habitat and foraging areas for Antarctic krill and baleen whales, there is an urgent need to develop better understanding of the structure, dynamics and climate-sensitivity of WAP subpolar fjord ecosystems.

Biology of the Antarctic dragonfish Vomeridens infuscipinnis (Notothenioidei: Bathydraconidae)	ANTARCTIC SCIENCE												Nineteen specimens of the rare dragonfish Vomeridens infuscipinnis were evaluated for meristic counts, morphometric measurements, vomerine teeth and the supratemporal canal, anatomical and histological observations of bone, cartilage and lipid, diet, and reproductive status. Seven individuals were measured for buoyancy. All specimens had small vomerine teeth that varied in number. There was also variability in the arrangement of the supratemporal pores and canals. Vomeridens possess a body with little bone and considerable amounts of cartilage and lipid. A mean percentage buoyancy of 1.61% indicated that Vomeridens is nearly neutrally buoyant. Inferences from measurements of buoyancy and from morphological data suggest that Vomeridens lives in an epibenthic water column habitat at 400-900 m. Facilitated by its reduced body density, Vomeridens are likely to forage in the water column by hovering above the substrate. The stomach contents consisted of krill (Euphausia superba), some as large as 46-50 mm. The absolute and relative fecundity in seven female was 1576-2296 oocytes (mean 1889) and 21.3-28.9 oocytes g(-1) body weight (mean 25.3), respectively. The reproductive effort in terms of egg diameter, GSI, and absolute and relative fecundity is similar to that for other bathydraconids.

As key animals in the Antarctic ecosystem, they are monitored to evaluate the ecological status of this pristine and remote region and specifically, they have been used as effective bioindicators suitable for long-term monitoring of metals in the Antarctic environment. However, studies about the role of this emblematic organism could play in the recycling of trace metals (TMs) in the Antarctic ecosystem are very limited. In this study we evaluate, using the peer review research articles already published and our own findings, the distribution of metals (i.e., Ca, Fe, Al, Na, Zn, Mg, Cu, K, Cd, Mn, Sr, Cr, Ni, Pb, Hg, V, Ba, Co, La, Ag, Rb, Hf, Sc, Au and Cs) and metalloids (As and Sb), measured in different biotic matrices, with emphasis on guano, of the Chinstrap (Pygoscelis antarcticus), Adelie (Pygoscelis adeliae) and Gentoo (Pygoscelis papua) penguins. Regarding bioactive metals, the high concentrations (mu g g(-1) dry weight) of Cu (2.0 +/- 1.4) x 10(2), Fe (4.1 +/- 2.9) x 10(2), Mn (30 +/- 34) and Zn (210 +/- 90) reported in the guano from all the penguin species studied including our data, are of the same order of magnitude as those reported for whale feces (mu g g(-1) dry weight): Cu (2.9 +/- 2.4) x 10(2), Fe (1.5 +/- 1.4) x 10(2), Mn (28 +/- 17) and Zn (6.2 +/- 4.3) x 10(2), and one order of magnitude higher than the metal contents in krill (mu g g(-1) dry weight) of Cu (10.2 +/- 5.5), Fe (24 +/- 29) and Zn (13.5 +/- 1.7). This suggest that penguin's excretion products could be an important source of these essential elements in the surface water, with an estimated annual release on a breeding season for Cu, Fe, Mn, Zn respectively of 28, 56, 4 and 29 tons, for the Chinstrap, Adelie and Gentoo penguins. The results provide evidence on the potential influence of penguins recycling TMs in the surface layer of the water column.

J	Ford, MP; Santhanakrishnan, A				Ford, Mitchell P.; Santhanakrishnan, Arvind			On the role of phase lag in multi-appendage metachronal swimming of euphausiids	BIOINSPIRATION & BIOMIMETICS												Metachronal paddling is a common method of drag-based aquatic propulsion, in which a series of swimming appendages are oscillated, with the motion of each appendage phase-shifted relative to the neighboring appendages. Ecologically and economically important euphausiid species such as Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) swim constantly by stroking their paddling appendages (pleopods), with locomotion accounting for the bulk of their metabolic expenditure. They tailor their swimming gaits for behavioral and energetic needs by changing pleopod kinematics. The functional importance of inter-pleopod phase lag (phi) to metachronal swimming performance and wake structure is unknown. To examine this relation, we developed a geometrically and dynamically scaled robot ('krillbot') capable of self-propulsion. Krillbot pleopods were prescribed to mimic published kinematics of fast-forward swimming (FFW) and hovering (HOV) gaits of E. superba, and the Reynolds number and Strouhal number of the krillbot matched well with those calculated for freely-swimming E. superba. In addition to examining published kinematics with uneven phi between pleopod pairs, we modified E. superba kinematics to uniformly vary phi from 0% to 50% of the cycle. Swimming speed and thrust were largest for FFW with phi between 15%-25%, coincident with phi range observed in FFW gait of E. superba. In contrast to synchronous rowing (phi = 0%) where distances between hinged joints of adjacent pleopods were nearly constant throughout the cycle, metachronal rowing (phi > 0%) brought adjacent pleopods closer together and moved them farther apart. This factor minimized body position fluctuation and augmented metachronal swimming speed. Though swimming speed was lowest for HOV, a ventrally angled downward jet was generated that can assist with weight support during feeding. In summary, our findings show that inter-appendage phase lag can drastically alter both metachronal swimming speed and the large-scale wake structure.

Sars 1856), the northern krill, is the largest and most abundant euphausiid species in the northern hemisphere, where it represents a key component of many pelagic communities. Although planktonic, krill could be considered a nektonic organism, as it is capable of active movements. This behaviour may be adaptive, because it allows these organisms to maintain their geographic position, leading to stable population structure, despite being continuously exposed to the heterogeneous oceanic conditions. By means of single-strand conformation polymorphism and DNA sequencing, we analyzed allelic variation of the Subunit 1 of NADH dehydrogenase mtDNA locus in 23 populations of the northern krill Meganyctiphanes norvegica, from 15 locations spanning the distribution range of the species. Analysis of the data indicated that the genetic structure, as revealed by analysis of population samples collected at the same site in consecutive years, was stable during that sampling period. Our results revealed the existence of 4 genetically and geographically distinct gene pools of M. norvegica, 2 occurring in the NE Atlantic ('northern' NE Atlantic and 'southern' NE Atlantic), 1 in the NW Atlantic, and 1 in the Mediterranean (Ligurian) Sea.

Predatory impact of the myctophid fish community on zooplankton in the Scotia Sea (Southern Ocean)	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												Myctophids are the most abundant mesopelagic fishes in the Southern Ocean, although their trophic role within the predominantly krill-based food web in regions south of the Antarctic Polar Front (APF) is poorly resolved. This study therefore examined the diets of 10 species of myctophid fishes: Electrona antarctica, E. carlsbergi, Gymnoscopelus braueri, G. fraseri, G. nicholsi, Krefftichthys anderssoni, Proto myctophum bolini, P. tenisoni, P. choriodon and Nannobrachium achirus, in the Scotia Sea, together with their predatory impact on the underlying zooplankton community. Myctophids and their prey were sampled in different seasons by scientific nets deployed across the Scotia Sea from the sea-ice zone to the APF. Based on the percentage index of relative importance, myctophids had high overlap in their diets, although the data indicate dietary specialisation in some species. There was also a distinct switch in diet, from copepods to euphausiids and amphipods, with increasing myctophid size. Myctophid predation impacted daily copepod production by between 0.01 and 5%, with Calanus simillimus being most impacted. Total annual consumption of copepods was around 1.5 million t (Mt) per year. All myctophids preyed upon the euphausiid Thysanoessa spp., consuming similar to 12% of its daily productivity and around 4 Mt per year. However, only larger myctophid species preyed upon Antarctic krill Euphausia superba, consuming 2% of its daily productivity, which could amount to as much as 17 Mt per year. Themisto gaudichaudii was also an important dietary component, with 4% of its daily productivity being consumed, amounting to around 2 Mt per year. This study demonstrates that myctophids link secondary productivity to higher predators both through krill-dependent and krill-independent trophic pathways.

The sizes of these colonies have displayed significant interannual variability during the 29-yr period. We hypothesized that changes are related to natural environmental factors; and used path analysis to analyze annual variation in population growth in relation to physical environmental factors during that part of the record with comparable sea-ice satellite imagery from 1973 to 1997. The Ross Sea sector of the Southern Ocean lying north of Ross Island, from 150 degreesE to 1300 W, comprised our study area. Annual population growth measured during summer was explained best, and inversely, by the extent of sea-ice in the study area 5 winters earlier, and in some way related to the Southern Oscillation. Analysis of a subset of the sea-ice data from 1979 to 1997 indicated strong correlations to ice conditions in the eastern portion of the study area (174 to 130 degreesW), and virtually no correlations to the western half (150 degreesE to 175 degreesW). This result supported other indirect evidence that the Ross Island penguins winter in the eastern Ross Sea/western Amundsen Sea. A demographic model indicated that variation in survival of juveniles and subadults might account for the observed population variation, and would also explain the 5-yr lag as 5 yr is the average age of recruitment to the summer breeding population. Extensive sea-ice during winter appears to reduce subadult survival, expressed subsequently when these cohorts reach maturation. We hypothesize that extensive (more northerly) sea-ice Limits access of penguins to productive waters known to occur south of the southern boundary of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current, with starvation or increased predation disproportionately affecting less-experienced birds. The observed patterns of penguin population change, including those preceding the satellite era, imply that sea-ice extent has changed significantly over recent decades.																	0171-8630	1616-1599					2001	213						301	309		10.3354/meps213301							WOS:000168704100023

To investigate the microzooplankton spatial distribution and to assess how climate change could affect the tintinnids community, sea water samples were collected during late summer 2018 at 19 stations in three different areas: Deception Island, Elephant Island and Antarctic Sound. The microzooplankton community comprised mainly tintinnids, aloricate ciliates, heterotrophic dinoflagellates and micrometazoans. Microzooplankton abundance varied between 3 and 109 ind. L-1 and biomass ranged from 0.009 to 2.55 mu g C L-1. Significant differences in terms of abundance and taxonomic composition of microzooplankton were found among the three sampling areas. Deception Island area showed 44% of tintinnids and the rest were heterotrophic dinoflagellate, aloricate ciliates and micrometazoans. In Elephant Island and Antarctic Sound areas, tintinnids reached, respectively, 73% and 83% of the microzooplankton composition, with all the other groups varying between 20 and 30%. Tintinnids were the most representative group in the area, with the species Codonellopsis balechi, Codonellopsis glacialis, Cymatocylis convallaria and Cymatocylis drygalskii. The highest amounts of tintinnids were found at the surface and 100 m depth. The above mentioned species may be considered key species for the WAP and therefore they can be used to track environmental and hydrographical changes in the area. In late summer, microzooplankton presented low abundances and biomass, nevertheless they represented an important fraction of the planktonic community in the area.

J	Bryan, PJ; McClintock, JB; Baker, BJ				Bryan, PJ; McClintock, JB; Baker, BJ			Population biology and antipredator defenses of the shallow-water Antarctic nudibranch Tritoniella belli	MARINE BIOLOGY												The circumpolar nudibranch Tritoniella belli Eliot occurs in abundance in shallow-water benthic communities of McMurdo Sound, Antarctica. Density estimates based on belt transects averaged collectively 0.46 individuals m(-2) at three study sites between depths of 6 and 30 m in November 1996. At two of the sites, population densities increased linearly between 18 and 30 m depth (up to 0.7 and 1.15 individuals m(-2) at 30 m depth). Individuals at all sites were rare or absent at depths shallower than 12 m. Size frequencies of individuals at the sites were similar, and a pooled analysis revealed a unimodal distribution skewed highly towards juvenile size classes. This suggests both recent recruitment and constant rates of mortality across size classes. The relationship between foot length and wet weight best fits an exponential growth equation, indicative of an allometric growth pattern. Distribution of T. belli in the field suggests that it is a habitat and diet generalist. Potential invertebrate predators include sea anemones and seastars, both of which co-occur in abundance in McMurdo Sound. Laboratory experiments indicate that the sea anemone Isotealia antarctica can capture and ingest T. belli. However, 70% of T. belli that are captured escape from the tentacles or, following ingestion, are rejected from the gastrovascular cavity. The seastars Odontaster validus, Perknaster fuscus, and Acodontaster conspicuus, avoid contact with T. belli, but if forced into contact with mantle tissues, retract their tube-feet. Mucus secreted from the mantle tissues, coated on to the tips of glass rods, and presented to seastar tube-feet, causes significantly longer tube-foot retraction times than control rods. Moreover, pieces of freeze-dried krill coated with mantle mucus are consumed significantly less often than untreated control pieces of krill by a benthic scavenging fish (Pseudotrematomas bernacchi). Employing seastar tube-foot retractions as a bioassay, we found the bioactive compound(s) are soluble in ethyl acetate, indicating they are lipophilic or moderately hydrophilic in nature. Chemical defenses in the mucus of T. belli probably contribute to its high abundance in Antarctic benthic communities.

Processes driving seasonal variability in DMS, DMSP, and DMSO concentrations and turnover in coastal Antarctic waters	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												This study presents new measurements of the concentrations and turnover rates of dimethyl sulfide (DMS), dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP), and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) in coastal waters near Palmer Station, Antarctica, during the spring and summer of 2012-2013. Using several novel analytical and experimental techniques, we document variability in DMS, DMSP, and DMSO (DMS/P/O) concentrations and quantify dominant production and removal terms in the mixed layer DMS budget. Our results demonstrate considerable seasonal variability in the concentration of DMS (range 0-20 nM), total DMSP (8-160 nM), and total DMSO (4-160 nM). Over the seasonal cycle, dissolved DMSP concentrations were well correlated with total DMSP concentrations and the abundance of Phaeocystis antarctica, while DMSO concentrations (total and dissolved) were well correlated with DMS concentrations. DMSP cleavage from the dissolved pool (mean rate=5.5 nM d(-1)) and release from microzooplankton grazing (mean 5.6 nM d(-1)) were the dominant sources of DMS, with smaller DMS production rates associated with DMSO reduction from the dissolved pool (mean 2.6 nM d(-1)) and krill grazing (mean 0.82 nM d(-1)). Specific rate constants for DMSP cleavage were inversely related to net primary production. Bacterial uptake was a primary contributor to DMS removal (mean -12 nM d(-1)), and we observed a significant correlation between bacterial production and gross DMS loss rate constants.

Data were collected on three cruises to the southern Scotia and northern Weddell seas during spring 1983, autumn 1986, and winter 1988. During winter, Antarctic fur seals were significantly associated with drift, pancake, brash ice, icebergs, and areas of uneven floe distribution, all characteristic of the marginal ice zone. Fur seals were seen in open water close to the ice edge during autumn, but during spring, as the pack ice began to retreat rapidly, animals were seen more often away from the ice. Minke whales were also associated with pancake and new ice but were seen further into the pack ice during both winter and autumn. The largest groups of minke whales during winter were observed with a large krill swarm in new ice. Crabeater seal was exclusively a species of the deep pack ice during all seasons and was associated with ice cover of 7-8 oktas and evenly distributed ice floes.																	0954-1020					JUN	1991	3	2					181	186		10.1017/S0954102091000214							WOS:A1991FR41900006

They allowing primary production and providing new seabed for colonisation, both acting as a negative feedback of climate change. However, the injection of sediment-laden runoff from the melting of land-terminating glaciers may reduce this feedback. Changes in particulate matter will affect nutrition and excretion (faeces stoichiometry and properties) of suspension feeders, reshaping coastal carbon dynamics and pelagic-benthic coupling. Absorption efficiency and biodeposition of Euphausia superba and Cnemidocarpa verrucosa were quantified for different food treatments and varying sediment concentrations. Both species showed high overall absorption efficiency for free-sediment diets, but were negatively affected by sediment addition. High sediment conditions increased krill biodeposition, while it decreased in ascidians. Energy balance estimation indicated high carbon sink potential in ascidians, but it is modulated by food characteristics and negatively affected by sediment inputs in the water column.

J	Daneri, GA				Daneri, GA			Fish diet of the Antarctic fur seal, Arctocephalus gazella, in summer, at Stranger Point, King George Island, South Shetland Islands	POLAR BIOLOGY												In February 1992, 34 faecal samples from non-breeding male Antarctic fur seals, Arctocephalus gazella, were collected at Stranger Point, King George Island, South Shetlands. Fish constituted an important part of the diet, occurring in 90% of those seats containing prey remains. From 1162 otoliths found in the faeces, 1086 were identified to at least family level. Myctophids and nototheniids represented together almost 90% of the fish eaten. The dominant species were Gymnoscopelus nicholsi, Pleuragramma antarcticum and Electrona antarctica, contributing 33.3%, 30.8% and 12.0% of the otoliths respectively. The standard length of these three species was estimated from otoliths with little or no signs of erosion. This study showed that fur seals fed mainly on pelagic fish species that are often associated with krill. These findings are corroborated by fur seal diving patterns.																	0722-4060					MAY	1996	16	5					353	355									WOS:A1996UM01000007						
J	Salihoglu, B; Fraser, WR; Hofmann, EE				Salihoglu, B; Fraser, WR; Hofmann, EE			Factors affecting fledging weight of Adelie penguin (Pygoscelis adeliae) chicks: a modeling study	POLAR BIOLOGY												An individual-based model is developed to examine mechanisms that potentially underlie the observed constancy in fledging weight (2.8-3.2 kg) of Adelie (4Pygoscelis adeliae) penguin chicks, in spite of large variability in the abundance of Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba), the primary food source. The model describes the energetic requirements of the chick. with growth resulting from the difference between assimilated energy and respiration. Parameterizations of these metabolic processes are based upon experimental and field observations. Ingestion of Antarctic krill by the chick is dependent on the frequency of food delivery to the chick by the adults, which is based on measured foraging times. The mass, size, and size frequency distribution of Antarctic krill fed to the chick are specified using empirical data. The energy content of the Ant arctic krill provided to the chick is taken to be constant or allowed to vary with size. The simulations show that food availability is most critical in the latter portion of chick development, when growth rates and food demands are high. Low food availability during this time must be compensated by either feeding chicks with larger krill of higher caloric value or by increased assimilation efficiency. Periods when small krill with lower caloric value dominate require more frequent. feeding of the chicks in order to attain their observed fledging weight. Thus, although the total food energy given to the chick is the main factor determining chick growth, the distribution of food availability relative to chick size (i.e., different net growth rates) and food quality are also factors influencing the fledging weight of penguin chicks. The simulations provide insight into the compensating effects of food delivery, food quality, and metabolic processes that allow Adelie penguin chicks to reach their observed fledging weight in spite of considerable environmental variability in food supply.

Phytoplankton community structure and stocks in the Southern Ocean (30-80 degrees E) determined by CHEMTAX analysis of HPLC pigment signatures	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY												The geographic distribution, stocks and vertical profiles of phytoplankton of the seasonal ice zone off east Antarctica were determined during the 2005-2006 austral summer during the Baseline Research on Oceanography, Krill and the Environment-West (BROKE-West) survey. CHEMTAX analysis of HPLC pigment samples, coupled with microscopy, permitted a detailed survey along seven transects covering an extensive area between 30 degrees E and 80 degrees E, from 62 degrees S to the coast. Significant differences were found in the composition and stocks of populations separated by the Southern Boundary of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (SB), as well as a small influence of the Weddell Gyre in the western sector of the 'zone south of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current' (SACCZ). Within the SACCZ, we identified a primary bloom under the ice, a secondary bloom near the ice edge, and an open-ocean deep population. The similarity of distribution patterns across all transects allowed us to generalise a hypothesized sequence for the season. The primary phytoplankton bloom, with stocks of Chl a up to 239 mg m(-2), occurred about 35 days before complete disappearance of the sea ice, and contained both cells from the water column and those released from melting ice. These blooms were composed of haptophytes (in particular, colonies and gametes of Phaeocystis antarctica), diatoms and cryptophytes (or the cryptophyte symbiont-containing ciliate Myrionecta rubrum). Aggregates released by melting ice quickly sank from the upper water column and Chl a stocks declined to 56-92 mg m(-2), but the bloom of diatoms and, to a lesser extent, cryptophytes continued until about 20 days after ice melt. The disappearance of sea ice coincided with a sharp increase in P. antarctica and grazing, as indicated by increasing phaeophytin a and phaeophorbide a. Chlorophyllide content suggests that the diatom bloom then senesced, probably due to iron exhaustion. Stocks rapidly declined, apparently due to grazing krill that moved southward following the retreating sea ice. We suggest that grazing of the bloom and export of faecal pellets stripped the upper water column of iron (as suggested by low Fv/Fm ratios and CHEMTAX pigment ratios in Haptophytes - iron was not measured). Thus, export of iron by grazing, and possibly sedimentation, created a southward migrating iron gradient, limiting growth in the upper water column. North of the postulated iron gradient, a nanoflagellate community developed at depth, with Chl a stocks from 36-49 mg m(-2). This community was probably based on regenerated production, sustained by residual and/or upwelling iron, as indicated by a close correspondence between distributions of Chl a and profiles of Fv/Fm. The community consisted of haptophytes (chiefly Phaeocystis gametes), dinoflagellates, prasinophytes, cryptophytes, and some small diatoms. Selective grazing by krill may have fashioned and maintained the community. North of the SB, Chl a ranged from 40-67 mg m(-2) and was found predominantly in the mixed layer, but Fv/Fm ratios remained low, suggesting the community of P. antarctica and diatoms was iron-limited. These interpretations provide a cogent explanation for the composition and structure of late summer microbial populations in the marginal ice zone. Crown Copyright (C) 2009 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

J	Ju, SJ; Scolardi, K; Daly, KL; Harvey, HR				Ju, SJ; Scolardi, K; Daly, KL; Harvey, HR			Understanding the trophic role of the Antarctic ctenophore, Callianira antarctica, using lipid biomarkers	POLAR BIOLOGY												To better understand the trophic role of ctenophores in Antarctica during austral fall and winter, a major species of cydippid ctenophore, Callianira antarctica, was collected during April/May (fall) and August/September (winter) 2002 in the vicinity of Marguerite Bay. Lipid content, lipid classes, fatty acids, fatty alcohols and sterols were analyzed in animals, together with lipid biomarkers in krill and copepod species representing potential ctenophore prey. Lipid content in ctenophores collected in winter was slightly higher than from animals in fall (4.8 and 3.5% of dry weight, respectively). Polar lipids were the dominant lipid class in ctenophores, accounting for over half of the lipid content, with significant amounts of free fatty alcohols (more than 10% of total lipid content) detected. Lipid-class composition, however, differed significantly between seasons, with significant amounts of neutral lipid (wax esters and triacylglycerols) only detected in animals from fall. Although the dominant lipid classes in ctenophores varied between fall and winter, individual lipids (i.e., fatty acids, alcohols and sterols) showed only minor changes between seasons. Specifically, long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids [20:5(n-3) and 22:6(n-3)] found in high abundance in larval krill were also elevated in ctenophores collected in winter. Very high amounts of monounsaturated fatty alcohols, particularly 20:1(n-9) and 22:1(n-11), known to be important components of wax esters in calanoid copepods, were also observed. Multivariate analysis using the suite of lipids found indicated that copepods are an important diet item for ctenophores in the study area. Results further suggest that C. antarctica feed actively year-round, with larval krill providing a food resource during austral winter.

J	Santora, JA; LaRue, MA; Ainley, DG				Santora, Jarrod A.; LaRue, Michelle A.; Ainley, David G.			Geographic structuring of Antarctic penguin populations	GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND BIOGEOGRAPHY												Aim We hypothesized that regional spatial organization of Antarctic penguin breeding populations was affected by social factors, that is, proximity and size of adjacent colonies, and by physical factors, that is, availability of breeding habitat and proximity of polynyas and submarine canyons where prey is abundant. The hypothesis of Furness and Birkhead (1984), that forage competition and density-dependence affect geographic structure of seabird populations, was tested previously for Antarctic penguins when biologging to quantify colony foraging areas was less common and when assessments of colony size reflected a compendium of historical counts. These data on foraging areas and colony size are now available following 20 years of frequent biologging and real-time satellite data on colony locations and sizes. Location Antarctica. Major taxa studied Penguin species. Time period Present day. Methods We prepared a literature summary on the basis of biologging studies to improve assessment of foraging ranges. We collated colony sizes from recent sources and integrated them with data on submarine canyon systems and polynyas. We used geospatial models to assess the relationships of the latter features to colony size, clustering, and distribution around Antarctica. Results The equal spacing of emperor penguin colonies was constant, with spacing a function of foraging range. In contrast, colonies of other penguin species were clustered, with small colonies adjacent to one another and within the outer edge of the foraging area of large colonies. Colonies and especially clusters occurred near polynyas and canyons around Antarctica. Main conclusions Density-dependent processes and geography explained penguin colony distribution. We conclude that inter- and intraspecific trophic competition affects the geographic structuring of colony distribution and size, although not necessarily in the same way among species. Results are relevant to assessing effects of climate, ecosystem dynamics, fisheries and other factors on penguin population trends at regional scales. We suggest that considering penguin colony distribution and abundance at the regional or cluster level is necessary to understand changes in these attributes.																	1466-822X	1466-8238				OCT	2020	29	10					1716	1728		10.1111/geb.13144							WOS:000573170400008

Satellite transmitters were used to track adult males and females and to obtain information about dive depths. Male fur seals migrated away from the breeding area during the postbreeding period whereas females remained close to the breeding grounds and foraged in the same area during two consecutive years. The most intensive foraging by females was associated with the edge of:he continental shelf of South Georgia. Males dived deeper than females. Counts of males at South Georgia and at the South Orkney Islands support the result from satellite tracking data showing that males move from South Georgia to the South Orkney Islands at the end of the breeding season. Unlike males, females were limited in their foraging range by the necessity to return to feed dependent young, so breeding sites are likely to be located close to foraging areas that are optimal for females. Locations used for feeding by females were avoided by males, either because they were suboptimal for males or because foraging by females at South Georgia causes local depletion of food, and males, which have the option to forage further afield, can forage more successfully in regions where there are no females. Comparison with fisheries data also suggests that these fur seals are targeting the most abundant exploitable prey.				Tony R. Walker BSc, MPhil/ABA-4581-2020	Tony R.

While the geochemical behaviour of this radionuclide in the marine environment is well known, relatively few studies have explored its interactions with biota. To better understand biologically related Th-234 dynamics, bioaccumulation of Th-234 from the dissolved phase and its subsequent retention in small Antarctic crustaceans (the isopod Natatolana oculata and the amphipods Orchomenella ultima and Uristes stebbingi) was determined under controlled laboratory conditions. Despite morphological and behavioural differences, all three species displayed comparable concentration factors (CF >= 80) and very long retention of Th-234 (biological half-life not significantly different from infinity). From 16% (isopod) to 49% (both amphipods) of accumulated Th-234 was associated with the animal soft parts, which is substantial when compared with reported values for other particle-reactive transuranic elements. The relevance of zooplankton as a potential modulator of Th-234 distribution in the water column is discussed in light of these findings. CF-based computations suggest that, for typical zooplankton biomass, biologically mediated interactions with particle flux models can be neglected. In contrast, in waters with very high crustacean biomass, such as krill schools, Th-234 distribution in the water column would be largely determined by these organisms. In such waters the biological compartment should be addressed as it could confound the reliability of vertical particle flux assessment using Th-234 as a proxy. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Twenty seven sites were examined and mean concentrations in the upper 150 m of the water column were for DMS 8 nM (range nd-63 nM); DMSPd 5 nM (nd-36 nM); DMSPp 11 nM (nd-38 nM), and DMSPt 16 nM (nd-54 nM). The highest concentrations of the sulphur compounds occurred in the western sector of the study area on the Antarctic shelf and across the Antarctic Slope Front region (ASF) of the eastern Weddell Gyre (EWG) in the Cosmonaut Sea. Concentrations were lower north of the ASF region of the EWG and in the eastern sector of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) and the greater Prydz Bay Gyre (PBG) circulation in the Cooperation Sea. The influence of melting pack ice on DMS and DMSPd concentrations was apparent in this study but was predominantly restricted to a few stations in the Cosmonaut Sea early in the voyage. DMS concentrations were extremely high at stations in the western sector of the Marginal Ice Zone (MIZ) in the early part of the study (mean 25 nM), reaching concentrations as high as 63 nM at station 42, decreasing to a mean concentration of 5.5 nM in the reduced MIZ to the east. In the Seasonal Mixed-Layer (SML) water (4-50 m) from the ACC and EWG, mean DMS concentrations were 5 nM, whilst very low concentrations of DMS occurred under forming sea ice (0.5 nM). Mean DMSPp concentrations in the top 50 m of the MIZ stations across the survey were closely similar (18-20 nM) and slightly higher than SML waters (13-14 nM), whilst mean DMSPd concentrations were 275 and 100% higher in samples from the MIZ stations (8-15 nM), compared with SML waters (4 nM). In the eastern sector, the coastal region across the shelf break and ASF region was largely free of ice and there was generally no elevation of DMSPd (mean 4 nM). This suggests that biological processes associated with the pack or fast ice in the ASP region of the western sector of the survey, in conjunction with the oceanography of the region, may have caused the high concentrations of DMS and DMSPd observed at latitudes >67 degrees S. Whilst filtration affects did influence DMSPd concentrations at a few sites, it was clear that elevated DMS and DMSPd concentrations occurred in the top 50 m and Winter Water (WW) layers of MIZ stations, and in High-Salinity Shelf Water (HSSW) at specific locations on the Antarctic Shelf, and likely reflected melting sea ice. DMS and DMSPp were also detected below the euphotic zone in Modified Circumpolar Deep Water (MCDW) on the Antarctic slope, with DMSPp possibly transported there in sedimenting detritus and faecal material. The significant concentrations of DMS detected in lower MCDW (0.42-1.1 nM) and Antarctic Bottom Water (AABW, 2.7 nM) were likely to have been transported to these depths in wintertime as dense shelf-water overflows from the Cape Darnley and Prydz Bay source regions. The high concentrations of DMS and DMSPd observed in the surface waters of the MIZ further support the importance of the Antarctic region and the sea-ice zone to the global sulphur cycle.

J	Southwell, D; Emmerson, L; Forcada, J; Southwell, C				Southwell, Darren; Emmerson, Louise; Forcada, Jaume; Southwell, Colin			A bioenergetics model for estimating prey consumption by an Adelie penguin population in East Antarctica	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												Quantifying prey consumption by top predators is a crucial component of ecosystem-based management in the Southern Ocean. In this study, we developed a bioenergetics model to estimate prey consumption by a top predator, the Adelie penguin Pygoscelis adeliae. Our model predicts prey consumption throughout the breeding season and incorporates uncertainty in model parameters using Monte Carlo simulation. The model was parameterized with data obtained at Bechervaise Island, the site of a long-term monitoring program in East Antarctica. We parameterized the model (1) using 13 yr of penguin population data, (2) for a year in which penguins successfully reared their chicks (2001-2002) and (3) for a year with low breeding success (1998-1999). Daily per capita energy consumption during the breeding season averaged 4269 kJ d(-1) (95% CI: 4187-4352 kJ d(-1)) and 4684 kJ d(-1) (95% CI: 4596-4771 kJ d(-1)) for males and females, respectively. Over the entire breeding season a male breeder consumes 470 MJ (95% CI: 461-479 MJ) compared to 515 MJ (95% CI: 506-525 MJ) for a female. On average, the Bechervaise Island population of 1836 breeding pairs consumes 16 447 MJ d(-1) which amounts to 1 809 224 MJ during the breeding season. On the basis of variable breeding success and the proportion of krill and fish in their diet, we estimate that this population consumes 78 to 406 t of krill and 4 to 46 t of fish each breeding season. Our results demonstrate clear periods of peak consumption associated with the penguins' breeding cycle.																	0171-8630	1616-1599				APR 22	2015	526						183	197		10.3354/meps11182							WOS:000354394900014						
J	Micol, T; Jouventin, P				Micol, T; Jouventin, P			Long-term population trends in seven Antarctic seabirds at Pointe Geologie (Terre Adelie) - Human impact compared with environmental change	POLAR BIOLOGY												Antarctic seabird populations have been much studied over the last decades as bioindicators of the nature of variability in the Southern Ocean marine ecosystem, and most attention has been focused on the role of food supply and the extent of sea ice. In addition, the rapid spread of tourism and the activities of researchers since the early 1960s have raised questions related to their real and potential impact on bird populations. Our data sets start in 1952 for several species of Antarctic seabirds and this study documents the trends over a 14-year period (1985-1999) in seven species breeding on Pointe Geologie archipelago (Terre Adelie, Antarctica). This is the first study where the direct impact of destruction of breeding sites (for building of an airstrip) is examined and where such long-term populations trends have been assessed in such a number of Antarctic species at one site. Trends from 1985 show that for the whole archipelago and when excluding islands destroyed, Adelie penguins and south polar skuas were the only species to show a significant increase (>3.5% annual change). The others species showed opposite trends, three increasing slightly (southern fulmars +0.4%, cape petrels +2.3%, snow petrels +0.9%) and two decreasing (emperor penguin -0.9%, southern giant petrel -3.9%). Three species particularly affected by the destruction of their breeding habitat (Adelie penguin, cape petrel, snow petrel) showed the capability to restore their populations. The availability of food and nesting sites is discussed in relation to environmental change. Species feeding on krill (Adelie penguins and cape petrels) increased more than other species; however, decrease of ice cover can increase availability of nesting sites. The importance of long-term studies is shown when assessing the role of human activities in Antarctica compared to larger-scale changes.																	0722-4060	1432-2056				MAR	2001	24	3					175	185		10.1007/s003000000193							WOS:000167404800005						
J	de Santana, CN; Rozenfeld, AF; Marquet, PA; Duarte, CM				de Santana, Charles N.; Rozenfeld, Alejandro F.; Marquet, Pablo A.; Duarte, Carlos M.			Topological properties of polar food webs	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												Mean annual temperatures of the Arctic Ocean and Antarctic Peninsula are warming much faster than global mean warming rates, which will likely result in significant biological impacts. Whereas most assessments have been made on individual species, impacts may differ when entire ecosystems are considered, as effects may propagate through ecological interactions such as those in food webs (FWs). The vulnerability of FWs to adverse effects can be estimated from the topology of the networks involved. Here we describe topological characteristics of Arctic and Antarctic marine FWs relevant to their vulnerability to climate change. We analyzed 15 properties of the largest Arctic and Antarctic marine FWs available, and found important topological differences between them. The Arctic FW has greater top to basal and predator to prey species ratios and is more densely connected, with more omnivorous species, than the Antarctic FW. The cumulative degree distribution (CDD; cumulative distribution of the number of links that each species in the food web has) of the Arctic FW follows an exponential decay behavior, whereas that of the Antarctic has a power law cut-off at higher degrees. The differences in the properties analyzed indicate that the Arctic FW has a greater diversity of predators and top species, while the Antarctic has a greater diversity of prey and basal species. The former seems to be more vulnerable to trophic cascade effects resulting from losses of key predator species than the latter. Characteristics of CDDs suggest that the Arctic FW may be more robust against random extinctions of species, although it may be more vulnerable to extinctions affecting the most connected prey species, such as Antarctic krill Euphausia superba, which is the most connected prey species in this trophic network.

This study investigated the spatial distributions of larval and juvenile/adult stages of the Antarctic myctophid Electrona antarctica. Fish were sampled in January 2011 and 2012 on a transect along 140 degrees E and in January 2013 along 110 degrees E using two different opening/closing net systems. In total, 1075 specimens of E. antarctica were collected: 948 larvae, 127 juveniles/adults, and 2 in the transformation stage. Most larvae were collected at 5-200 m depth, with diel vertical migration (DVM) not apparent. Larvae were mainly distributed in the Modified Circumpolar Deep Water (-1.5 degrees C-2.0 degrees C). By contrast, an analysis of the echogram at 38 kHz and discrete depth samples implied that juveniles/adults undertook DVM except in the continental slope area (65.5 degrees S). As the distribution of krill is limited to the cold water mass (<-1.5 degrees C) along the continental slope, E. antarctica and krill populations are spatially separated off Wilkes Land during summer. According to the previously estimated larval period of 30-47 days, E. antarctica may spawn in late November to December in the marginal ice zone or near the sea ice edge. This study suggests that the environment related to sea ice provides a nursery ground for early stage larvae of E. antarctica. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. and NIPR.

Seasonal consistency and individual variation in foraging strategies differ among and within Pygoscelis penguin species in the Antarctic Peninsula region	MARINE BIOLOGY												Past research during the breeding season in the Antarctic Peninsula region indicates that gentoo penguins (Pygoscelis papua) are generalist foragers whereas Adelie (P. adeliae) and chinstrap (P. antarcticus) penguins tend to specialize on Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba). However, little is known about the degree of temporal consistency in the diets and foraging habitats of these three species, particularly at the individual level. Such year-round and interannual dietary understanding is important to help interpret contrasting trends in their populations. We used carbon and nitrogen stable isotope analysis of blood and feathers to evaluate seasonal shifts in diet and individual foraging consistency within Pygoscelis penguin species breeding in the South Shetland Islands as well as among three geographically distinct gentoo penguin populations in the western Antarctic Peninsula and South Shetland Islands. We found that gentoo penguins exhibited a generalist foraging strategy with individual consistency, Adelie penguins exhibited an intermediate generalist foraging strategy with little individual consistency, and chinstrap penguins exhibited a specialized diet with little inter-individual variation. Our results also indicated that all three species have greater variation in foraging habitat use during the post-breeding season compared to the breeding season. Finally, we observed differences in the degree of seasonal shifts in population level diet and consistency in foraging strategies at the individual level across the three gentoo penguin populations examined. This suggests that Pygoscelis penguins can differ in diets and foraging habitat use not only at the population level among species, sites, and seasons, but also in the level of variation within populations, and in the degree of seasonal consistency among individuals.

These GO-SA-AKP composite fibers were obtained by conventional wet spinning with 5% calcium chloride as a coagulation solution. The intermolecular interactions of the GO-SA-AKP composite system were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. The morphology, crystallinity, thermal stability, and mechanical properties of the GO-SA-AKP composites were investigated with scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, thermogravimetric analysis, and differential scanning calorimetry. The results show that the number of GO layers decreased gradually during the process of wet spinning. The addition of GO promoted an increase in intramolecular hydrogen bonding and a decrease in intermolecular hydrogen bonding in the composite system. With increasing GO mass fraction, the intermolecular hydrogen-bond content, crystallinity, breaking strength, and thermal stability in the composite system increased first and then decreased. At the same time, the mass fraction of GO and the draw ratio had significant effects on the surface morphologies of the composite fibers. (c) 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J. Appl. Polym.

Salpa thompsoni in the Indian Sector of the Southern Ocean: Environmental drivers and life history parameters	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY												The Southern Ocean ecosystem is thought to be experiencing a long-term increase in Salpa thompsoni. Uncertainty surrounds the environmental drivers behind variable S. thompsoni abundances, particularly within the East Antarctic region. In this study, S. thompsoni populations were sampled in the Indian Sector of the Southern Ocean, as part of the January-February 2016 Kerguelen Axis voyage. These recent data were compared against historical density records in the broader Kerguelen Plateau region from voyages during 1985-2006. Results show that 2016 maximum S. thompsoni densities across the Kerguelen Plateau were higher, and more southerly located, than those previously sampled in the area. The highest 2016 S. thompsoni abundances exceeded 2500 individuals 1000 m(-3) and were located between the Southern Boundary of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current and the Southern Antarctic Circumpolar Current Front. The life-stage composition of S. thompsoni comprised approximately 90% aggregates (blastozooids) and 10% solitaries (oozoids). Generalised Additive Models associated low chlorophyll-a concentration and low solar elevation (outside of peak daylight) with higher S. thompsoni abundances. In addition, elevated abundances occurred in locations from where the sea ice retreated at least eight weeks previously. These abundance-environment relationships are consistent with results from several previous surveys in the region and the West Antarctic. Due to the complex life cycle of S. thompsoni, and the unpredictability of their distribution patterns, multi-seasonal and multi-year surveys are needed to confirm whether the 2016 distribution patterns are indicative of a long-term increase or southerly shift in abundances. The new information from this study provides much needed baseline abundance and distribution data (which can be used to assess future change in a currently understudied oceanographic region) on a species capable of shaping the future ecosystem structure and function in the Indian Sector of the Southern Ocean.

Although the amount of eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid in the products is provided by the manufacturer, no or little information is available on their lipid pattern. Therefore, we quantitatively analyzed the fatty acid pattern in the lipid fractions triglycerides, phospholipids, ethyl esters, and free fatty acids in supplementation products by means of solid phase extraction and gas chromatography. Twelve products from the European and U.S. markets containing fish, krill, algal, or plant oil were analyzed. Total n-3 PUFA content ranged from 68 g/100 g fat (fish oil) to 42 g/100 g fat (algal oil) to 17 g/100 g fat (krill oil). On the basis of the n-3 PUFA containing lipid class, the supplements can be separated dominantly in ethyl ester, re-esterified triglyceride, triglyceride, and phospholipid containing products. Algae-based products contained natural triglycerides, krill oils a complex mixture of phospholipids, triglycerides, and free fatty acids, and fish oil products either ethyl esters, re-esterified triglycerides, or triglycerides. Even products of the same class and source showed distinct differences in their lipid pattern. A specification of the lipid composition of n-3 PUFA products would allow distinguishing the different (qualities of) supplements.

Long-term trends in albatross diets in relation to prey availability and breeding success	MARINE BIOLOGY												Diet analyses can reveal important changes in seabird foraging ecology and, by inference, resource availability and predator-prey dynamics within the wider marine ecosystem. Here, we analysed stomach contents of 1544 grey-headed albatross Thalassarche chrysostoma (GHA) and black-browed albatross T. melanophris (BBA) chicks from Bird Island, South Georgia. We describe dietary shifts (1996-2017), and link those to annual prey availability indices and breeding success. Annual variability in diet was high, and long-term trends in the main components were broadly similar in both albatrosses. Fish consumption (by mass) generally increased over time. Mackerel icefish Champsocephalus gunnari occurrence increased in GHA diets, but was unrelated to local densities derived from fisheries/research cruises. Cephalopod consumption declined until the early 2000s, then plateaued, and the occurrence of the ommastrephid squid Martialia hyadesi declined over time in both albatrosses. In BBAs, Antarctic krill Euphausia superba consumption decreased over time. Conversely, Antarctic krill consumption by GHAs increased until the early 2000s, decreased until the mid-2010s, and increased again in 2017. Antarctic krill consumption was unrelated to local densities based on acoustic surveys, and did not correlate with breeding success. Remotely sensed chlorophyll-a within core foraging areas showed a positive relationship with Antarctic krill in GHA diets, but a negative relationship with M. hyadesi occurrence in both albatross diets. Dietary shifts had consequences for GHA breeding success, which was negatively related to the importance of the cranchiid Galiteuthis glacialis and positively related to M. hyadesi importance. These results highlight the complex mechanisms linking prey availability, diet and breeding success in albatrosses.

Foraging behaviour of Antarctic fur seals rearing pups at Bird Island, South Georgia, was assessed using at-sea activity patterns measured by electronic time-depth recorders. Information was obtained for a total of 75 individuals and 191 foraging trips to sea over five reproductive seasons from 1988/89 to 1992/93; this included one season (1990/91) of low prey abundance. A method was developed to divide the diving record up into logical units or bouts which differed from past methods used for defining bouts of behaviour. 2. Foraging trips were significantly longer in 1990/91 than in the other years. There were significant differences between years in the proportion of time spent foraging when at sea and in the distribution of foraging through the day and night. These differences probably represent behavioural responses to changes in prey distribution and abundance and were reflected in the frequency of occurrence of different types of foraging behaviour. 3. Four types of foraging bout were recognized using a cluster analysis. Type I (short) bouts were of short duration (17 min) and occurred mainly during daytime and at dusk. They probably represented exploratory behaviour. Type II (long) bouts occurred mainly at night and were of long duration (80 min). They increased in frequency in 1990/91 when food was scarce and 61-73% of time spent foraging was in these bouts. Type III (shallow) bouts occurred mainly at night, were of short duration (12 min) and represented feeding close to the surface, possibly in association with other, surface-feeding krill predators. Shallow bouts accounted for 8-14% of time spent foraging. Type IV (deep) bouts were of medium duration (19 min) and represented feeding at greater depth (40-50 m) than other bout types. They were most abundant around dawn. 4. Mean dive duration during bouts exceeded the theoretical aerobic dive limit on > 30% of occasions for short, long and deep bouts. There were positive correlations between mean dive duration and surface interval duration for most of these bout types in most years. This suggested that long dives incurred a cost in terms of the amount of time spent at the surface between dives. 5. The study demonstrated that female fur seals invest a significantly greater effort in foraging during periods of low prey abundance by both increasing the time spent foraging and by increasing activity during foraging. This could represent a 30-50% increase in the costs of foraging during years of low food abundance.																	0021-8790	1365-2656				JUL	1994	63	3					703	713		10.2307/5235							WOS:A1994NW73000019

Interannual variability in phytoplankton biomass and species composition in northern Marguerite Bay (West Antarctic Peninsula) is governed by both winter sea ice cover and summer stratification	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												The rapid warming of the West Antarctic Peninsula region has led to reduced sea ice cover and enhanced glacial melt water input. This has potential implications for marine ecosystems, notably phytoplankton growth, biomass, and composition. Fifteen years (1997-2012) of year-round size fractionated chlorophyll a (Chl a), phytoplankton pigment fingerprinting and environmental data were analyzed to identify the relationship between sea ice cover, water column stability and phytoplankton dynamics in northern Marguerite Bay, Antarctica. Over the investigated period, both summer (December-February) and winter biomass declined significantly, 38.5% and 33.3% respectively. Winter phytoplankton biomass was low (< 0.25 g Chl a L-1) and consisted on average of 69% diatoms, 5% cryptophytes, and 20% haptophytes. Summers following winters with low (< 65 days) sea ice cover were characterized by decreased stratification strength and relatively low (median<4.4 g Chl a L-1) phytoplankton biomass, as compared to summers preceded by high winter sea ice cover. In addition, the summertime microphytoplankton (> 20 m) fraction was strongly decreased in the low biomass years, from 92% to 39%, coinciding with a smaller diatom fraction in favor of nanophytoplankton (< 20 m), represented by cryptophytes and haptophytes. In contrast, diatoms dominated (> 95%) during summers with average-to-high biomass. We advance a conceptual model whereby low winter sea ice cover leads to low phytoplankton biomass and enhanced proportions of nanophytoplankton, when this coincides with reduced stratification during summer. These changes are likely to have a strong effect on the entire Antarctic marine food web, including krill biomass, and distribution.

J	Hals, PA; Wang, XL; Xiao, YF				Hals, Petter-Arnt; Wang, Xiaoli; Xiao, Yong-Fu			Effects of a purified krill oil phospholipid rich in long-chain omega-3 fatty acids on cardiovascular disease risk factors in nonhuman primates with naturally occurring diabetes type-2 and dyslipidemia	LIPIDS IN HEALTH AND DISEASE												Background: High serum levels of cholesterol, in particular low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, are considered a significant risk factor for development of cardiovascular disease. Therefore, rigorous treatment regimens with statins and other pharmaceuticals have been used extensively to reduce elevated cholesterol levels. Literature data have not clearly concluded whether long-chain omega-3 fatty acids reduce, increase or leave circulating cholesterol unaffected. In the present study a novel krill-oil derived preparation of omega-3 rich phospholipids, mainly phosphatidylcholine, was administered orally at increasing doses for 12 weeks to dyslipidemic non-human primates, and cholesterols and several other risk factors for cardiovascular disease were measured before, during and after treatment. Methods: Six dyslipidemic non-human primates suffering from naturally occurring diabetes type-2 were included, three in a vehicle control group and three being treated with the omega-3 rich phospholipid preparation. The control and test items were given daily by gavage and the doses of the test item were 50, 150 and 450 mg phospholipids/kg/day. Each dose level was given for 4 weeks. Plasma concentrations of the omega-3 fatty acids were measured in connection with change in dose and the omega-3 index in erythrocytes was determined biweekly. Blood lipids, apolipoproteins and diabetes, inflammatory and safety biomarkers were determined either weekly, biweekly or every 4 weeks. For the blood lipids and apolipoproteins, control-adjusted mean values are presented while absolute values are presented for the other parameters. Due to the low number of animals in each group, no statistical analyses were done. Results: The only detectable effects measured during dosing with the lowest dose were an increase in HDLcholesterol and apolipoprotein A1. The intermediate and high doses decreased total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, apolipoprotein B100 and triglycerides and increased HDL-cholesterol and apolipoprotein A1. No effects were seen on the diabetes and inflammatory markers and on safety biomarkers. Conclusions: The results indicate that the omega-3 rich phospholipid preparation had a positive impact on cardiovascular disease risk factors by reducing total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol and triglycerides and increasing HDL-cholesterol. These findings justify further investigations of this preparation in animal models of dyslipidemia and, provided the current findings are confirmed, in human trials.																	1476-511X					JAN 17	2017	16								11	10.1186/s12944-017-0411-z							WOS:000396774300002	28095913

Seasonal variation in the predatory impact of myctophids on zooplankton in the Scotia Sea (Southern Ocean)	PROGRESS IN OCEANOGRAPHY												Myctophids are the biomass-dominant mesopelagic fishes in the Southern Ocean, but their trophic role within the pelagic food web south of the Antarctic Polar Front is poorly resolved from a seasonal perspective at the ocean-basin scale. In this study, the predatory impact of the predominant Southern Ocean myctophid community (Electrona antarctica, Electrona carlsbergi, Gymnoscopelus braueri, Gymnoscopelus fraseri, Gymnoscopelus nicholsi, Protomyctophum bolini, Protomyctophum tenisoni, Protomyctophum choriodon, Krefftichthys anderssoni and Nannobrachium achirus) on their zooplankton prey was examined during austral spring, summer and autumn in the Scotia Sea, one of the most productive regions of the Southern Ocean. Seasonal variations in diet and predation rates were apparent for all species. Based on the percentage index of relative importance, myctophids had high overlap in their diets, with all species mostly consuming copepods, small euphausiids and amphipods. Myctophid size was a key determinant of diet in the region, with larger species and intra-specific size classes consuming larger prey. Cluster analyses revealed myctophid feeding guilds that appeared to change seasonally, although there was little evidence of dietary specialisation. Myctophid predation on the daily productivity of most copepod species was relatively low across seasons (< 7%), except for Calanus simillimus that was predated upon highly in summer (similar to 26%). From the macrozooplankton component of the prey field, the myctophid community consumed substantial proportions of the euphausiid Thysanoessa spp. in each season (similar to 7 to 76% daily productivity), particularly in summer. Relatively high proportions of the daily Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) productivity (similar to 8-58%) were also consumed by the larger myctophid species, particularly in summer by Electrona antarctica, suggesting increased competition for krill resources during the higher predator breeding season and possible reductions in food web stability during periods of reduced krill availability at this time. The amphipod Themisto gaudichaudii formed an important part of the larger myctophid species' diet in all seasons, with between 10 and 38% of its daily productivity being consumed. Myctophid predation on the daily productivity of salps was up to 4%, whilst their impact on ostracods and pteropods was negligible (< 0.1% of daily productivity) in all seasons. This study demonstrates that Southern Ocean myctophids link secondary productivity to higher predators through both krill-independent and krill-dependent trophic pathways across seasons, with myctophids comprising a more krill-dependent pathway during austral summer.

Productivity and Change in Fish and Squid in the Southern Ocean	FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION												Southern Ocean ecosystems are globally important and vulnerable to global drivers of change, yet they remain challenging to study. Fish and squid make up a significant portion of the biomass within the Southern Ocean, filling key roles in food webs from forage to mid-trophic species and top predators. They comprise a diverse array of species uniquely adapted to the extreme habitats of the region. Adaptations such as antifreeze glycoproteins, lipid-retention, extended larval phases, delayed senescence, and energy-conserving life strategies equip Antarctic fish and squid to withstand the dark winters and yearlong subzero temperatures experienced in much of the Southern Ocean. In addition to krill exploitation, the comparatively high commercial value of Antarctic fish, particularly the lucrative toothfish, drives fisheries interests, which has included illegal fishing. Uncertainty about the population dynamics of target species and ecosystem structure and function more broadly has necessitated a precautionary, ecosystem approach to managing these stocks and enabling the recovery of depleted species. Fisheries currently remain the major local driver of change in Southern Ocean fish productivity, but global climate change presents an even greater challenge to assessing future changes. Parts of the Southern Ocean are experiencing ocean-warming, such as the West Antarctic Peninsula, while other areas, such as the Ross Sea shelf, have undergone cooling in recent years. These trends are expected to result in a redistribution of species based on their tolerances to different temperature regimes. Climate variability may impair the migratory response of these species to environmental change, while imposing increased pressures on recruitment. Fisheries and climate change, coupled with related local and global drivers such as pollution and sea ice change, have the potential to produce synergistic impacts that compound the risks to Antarctic fish and squid species. The uncertainty surrounding how different species will respond to these challenges, given their varying life histories, environmental dependencies, and resiliencies, necessitates regular assessment to inform conservation and management decisions. Urgent attention is needed to determine whether the current management strategies are suitably precautionary to achieve conservation objectives in light of the impending changes to the ecosystem.

J	Hagen, W; Auel, H				Hagen, W; Auel, H			Seasonal adaptations and the role of lipids in oceanic zooplankton	ZOOLOGY-ANALYSIS OF COMPLEX SYSTEMS					94th Annual Meeting of the German-Zoological-Society	JUN 04-08, 2001	UNIV OSNABRUCK, OSNABRUCK, GERMANY	German Zoolog Soc	UNIV OSNABRUCK			Oceanic zooplankton species exhibit quite diverse life history traits. A major driving force determining their life strategies is the seasonal variability in food supply, which is most pronounced in polar oceans where fluctuations in primary production are extreme. Seasonal adaptations are closely related to the trophic level of zooplankters, with strongest pressures occurring on herbivorous organisms. The dominant grazers, calanoid copepods and krill (Euphausiacea), have developed fascinating solutions for successful overwintering at higher latitudes. They usually exhibit a very efficient storage and utilization of energy reserves to reduce the effect of a highly seasonal primary production. The predominant larger Calanus species from the Arctic and Calanoides acutus from the Antarctic biosynthesize large amounts of high-energy wax esters with Iong-chain monounsaturated fatty acids and alcohols (20:1 and 22:1 isomers) as major components. They survive the dark season at depth in a stage of dormancy called diapause. In contrast, the Antarctic Calanus propinquus, a winter-active species, synthesizes primarily triacylglycerols, which are dominated by long-chain monounsaturated fatty acids with 22 carbon atoms (2 isomers) and yield even higher calorific contents. The omnivorous and carnivorous species, which are less subjected to seasonal food shortage, usually do not exhibit such an elaborate lipid biosynthesis. Herbivores usually do not utilize much of their enormous lipid reserves for overwintering, but channel this energy towards reproductive processes in late winter/early spring. Timing of reproduction is critical especially at high latitudes due to the short production period, and lipid reserves ensure early spawning independent of external resources. These energetic adaptations (dormancy, lipid storage) are supplemented by other life strategies such as extensive vertical migrations, change in the mode of life, and trophic flexibility.

J	VORONINA, NM				VORONINA, NM			EUPHAUSIID LARVAE IN THE SOUTHERN PART OF THE PACIFIC SECTOR OF ANTARCTIC IN FEBRUARY - MARCH, 1992	OKEANOLOGIYA												The material was collected on the latitudinal section that crossed the Pacific sector of the Antarctic in its very middle (67 degrees S) and in the area north-eastwards of the Balleni Islands. In February - March, 1992, during the VI cruise of the R/V ''Akademic Ioffe'' under the WOCE program. Four water modifications were studied: low latitude (Antarctic Circumpolar Current), high latitude (Coastal Antarctic Current), mixed and shelf waters. Plankton was collected with the 170 mu-mesh Juday closing nets at depths down to 1500 m or to the bottom. Larvae of 2 euphausiid species were found: Euphausia superba and Thysanoessa macrura. The first one was discovered only in the south-western part of the study region and was relatively abundant (>500 specimens/m(2)) only on two near-shore stations. T. macrura larvae were found everywhere, yet being limited vertically by the 0 - 200 m layer. Their average numbers were 36 +/- 13 spec/m(2) and, despite the previous data, they did not differ in different water modifications. The reasons are discussed. Three T. macrura local maxima occurred on the crossing frontal zones and in the vicinity of the intensive upwelling. The data of the stations show that postlarval development of T. macrura can be completed during the first period of growth only in a part of the region investigated. The quantitative distribution of euphausiids is discussed based on the obtained data and the available publications. The idea is disputed of the existence in the Pacific sector of Antarctic south of the ice northern boundary of a independent ecosystem characterized by abundance of this group and its domination in the community.																	0030-1574					SEP-OCT	1995	35	5					725	732									WOS:A1995TF08200012						
J	Arrigo, KR; Thomas, DN				Arrigo, KR; Thomas, DN			Large scale importance of sea ice biology in the Southern Ocean	ANTARCTIC SCIENCE												Despite being one of the largest biomes on earth, sea ice ecosystems have only received intensive study over the past 30 years. Sea ice is a unique habitat for assemblages of bacteria, algae, protists, and invertebrates that grow within a matrix dominated by strong gradients in temperature, salinity, nutrients, and UV and visible radiation. A suite of physiological adaptations allow these organisms to thrive in ice, where their enormous biomass makes them a fundamental component of polar ecosystems. Sea ice algae are an important energy and nutritional source for invertebrates such as juvenile krill, accounting for up to 25% of total annual primary production in ice-covered waters. The ability of ice algae to produce large amounts of UV absorbing compounds such as mycosporine-like amino acids makes them even more important to organisms like krill that can incorporate these sunscreens into their own tissues. Furthermore, the nutrient and light conditions in which sea ice algae thrive induce them to synthesize enhanced concentrations of polyunsaturated fatty acids, a vital constituent of the diet of grazing organisms, especially during winter. Finally, sea ice bacteria and algae have become the focus of biotechnology, and are being considered as proxies of possible life forms on ice-covered extraterrestrial systems. An analysis of how the balance between sea ice and pelagic production might change under a warming scenario indicates that when current levels of primary production and changes in the areas of sea ice habitats are taken into account, the expected 25% loss of sea ice over the next century would increase primary production in the Southern Ocean by approximately 10%, resulting in a slight negative feedback on climate warming.

Fish occurred in approximately 70% of seats that contained food remains irrespective of season. In spring, the main fish prey were Electrona antarctica, Pleuragramma antarcticum, and Notolepis coatsi, which together gave two-thirds of the 110 otoliths recovered. In summer, 457 otoliths were retrieved; the most frequent and abundant species were Gymnoscopelus nicholsi, E. antarctica, and P. antarcticum, which represented over 80% of the otoliths recovered. A substantial increase in the amount of fish ingested by fur seals occurred from spring to summer concomitant with a change in the relative proportion of fish taxa. Most fish species identified are pelagic and feed on krill. During the study period, commercial fishing in the area was not based upon any of the fish species identified.																	0008-4301					JUL	1999	77	7					1157	1160		10.1139/cjz-77-7-1157							WOS:000083510100016

Zooplankton Gut Passage Mobilizes Lithogenic Iron for Ocean Productivity	CURRENT BIOLOGY												Iron is an essential nutrient for phytoplankton, but low concentrations limit primary production and associated atmospheric carbon drawdown in large parts of the world's oceans [1, 2]. Lithogenic particles deriving from aeolian dust deposition, glacial runoff, or river discharges can form an important source if the attached iron becomes dissolved and therefore bioavailable [3-5]. Acidic digestion by zooplankton is a potential mechanism for iron mobilization [6], but evidence is lacking. Here we show that Antarctic krill sampled near glacial outlets at the island of South Georgia (Southern Ocean) ingest large amounts of lithogenic particles and contain 3-fold higher iron concentrations in their muscle than specimens from offshore, which confirms mineral dissolution in their guts. About 90% of the lithogenic and biogenic iron ingested by krill is passed into their fecal pellets, which contain 5-fold higher proportions of labile (reactive) iron than intact diatoms. The mobilized iron can be released in dissolved form directly from krill or via multiple pathways involving microbes, other zooplankton, and krill predators. This can deliver substantial amounts of bioavailable iron and contribute to the fertilization of coastal waters and the ocean beyond. In line with our findings, phytoplankton blooms downstream of South Georgia are more intensive and longer lasting during years with high krill abundance on-shelf. Thus, krill crop phytoplankton but boost new production via their nutrient supply. Understanding and quantifying iron mobilization by zooplankton is essential to predict ocean productivity in a warming climate where lithogenic iron inputs from deserts, glaciers, and rivers are increasing [7-10].

Climate-driven sympatry may not lead to foraging competition between congeneric top-predators	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS												Climate-driven sympatry may lead to competition for food resources between species. Rapid warming in the West Antarctic Peninsula (WAP) is coincident with increasing gentoo penguin and decreasing Adelie penguin populations, suggesting that competition for food may exacerbate the Adelie penguin decline. On fine scales, we tested for foraging competition between these species during the chick-rearing period by comparing their foraging behaviors with the distribution of their prey, Antarctic krill. We detected krill aggregations within the horizontal and vertical foraging ranges of Adelie and gentoo penguins, and found that krill selected for habitats that balance the need to consume food and avoid predation. In overlapping Adelie and gentoo penguin foraging areas, four gentoo penguins switched foraging behavior by foraging at deeper depths, a strategy which limits competition with Adelie penguins. This suggests that climate-driven sympatry does not necessarily result in competitive exclusion of Adelie penguins by gentoo penguins. Contrary to a recent theory, which suggests that increased competition for krill is one of the major drivers of Adelie penguin population declines, we suggest that declines in Adelie penguins along the WAP are more likely due to direct and indirect climate impacts on their life histories.																	2045-2322					JAN 6	2016	6								18820	10.1038/srep18820							WOS:000368241700001	26732496

Despite its ecological and commercial importance, genetic population structure of the Antarctic krill remains poorly described. In an attempt to illuminate genetic markers for future population and phylogenetic analysis, five E. superba mitogenomes, from samples collected west of the Antarctic Peninsula, were sequenced using new 454 next-generation sequencing techniques. The sequences, of lengths between 13,310 and 13,326 base pairs, were then analyzed in the context of two previously-published near-complete sequences. Sequences revealed relatively well-conserved partial mitochondrial genomes which included complete sequences for 11 of 13 protein-coding genes, 16 of 23 tRNAs, and the large ribosomal subunit. Partial sequences were also recovered for cox1 and the small ribosomal subunit. Sequence analysis suggested that the cox2, nad5, and nad6 genes would be the best candidates for future population genetics analyses, due to their high number of variable sites. Future work to reveal the noncoding control region remains.

Rapid development and persistence of a massive Antarctic sea ice tongue	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS												1] An extraordinary sea ice tongue developed near 85 degrees E over a period of 30 days in April-May 2002. The ice tongue extended to the north more than 800 km from the surrounding ice edge and covered an area greater than 200,000 km 2. Satellite measurements of ice extent and roughness characteristics demonstrate that the tongue persisted as a distinct feature throughout the winter. Remote sensing observations between 1978 and 2004 confirm that ice tongues occur frequently at this location, although the 2002 tongue was particularly pronounced. We show that ocean currents and winds conspire to favor the development of ice tongues at this location. Mean streamlines of the southern part of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current turn sharply to the north near 85 degrees E after passing through the Princess Elisabeth Trough. The edge and northern limit of the ice tongue correspond well with the pattern of mean streamlines. Mean winds in April - May have a dominant southerly component in this location, favoring offshore advection of ice; year- to- year variability in the prominence of the tongue is largely caused by variations in the wind, with northerly ( southerly) anomalies inhibiting ( promoting) development of a sea ice tongue. Ice drift is strongly northward along the axis of the tongue, suggesting the feature is formed by advection of ice from the south rather than by in situ thermodynamic ice formation. The northward current and sea ice tongue at 85 degrees E are associated with higher biomass at all trophic levels than observed elsewhere in east Antarctica.

To demonstrate and quantify these negative biases on both the estimates of biomass distribution and abundance, a time-depth-density analysis was performed. Data were collected, as part of the United States Antarctic Marine Living Resources Program (AMLR), in the vicinities of Elephant Island, Antarctica, during the austral summers of 1992 and 1993. Five surveys were conducted in 1992; two covered a 105 by 105 n.mi. area centered on Elephant Island, two encompassed a 60 by 35 n.mi. area immediately to the north of the Island, and one covered a 1 n.mi.(2) area centered on a large krill swarm to the west of Seal Island. The 1993 data include repetitions of the two small-area and two large-area surveys. Average krill volume densities were calculated for each hour as well as for three daily periods: day, twilight and night. These data were normalized and presented as a probability of daily average density. With spectral analysis to identify the frequencies of migration, a four-term periodic function was fitted to the probability density function of average daily biomass versus local apparent time. This function was transformed to create a temporal compensation function (TCF) for upwardly adjusting acoustic biomass estimates. The TCF was then applied to the original 1992 survey data; the resulting biomass estimates are an average of 49.5% higher than those calculated disregarding biases due to diel vertical migration. The effect of DVM on the estimates of krill distribution are illustrated by a comparison of compensated and uncompensated density maps of two 1992 surveys. Through this technique, high density krill areas are revealed where uncompensated maps indicated low densities.																	0967-0637					APR	1995	42	4					455	475		10.1016/0967-0637(94)E0005-C							WOS:A1995RG45600003

A foodweb model to explore uncertainties in the South Georgia shelf pelagic ecosystem	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY												Foodweb models provide a useful framework for compiling data on biomass, production, consumption and feeding relationships. They are particularly useful for identifying gaps and inconsistencies in the data, and for exploring plausible scenarios of change. We compiled data on the pelagic foodweb of the South Georgia shelf, which is one of the most intensively studied areas in the Southern Ocean. The data suggest that current average annual copepod production is three times that of Antarctic krill and that flying seabirds and fish are, respectively, responsible for 25% and 21% of local krill consumption. The most striking inconsistency was that estimated consumption of fish was 5 times their estimated production. We developed a static mass balance model of the foodweb representing one of many possible solutions to the inconsistencies in the data. The model included sufficient fish biomass to balance the original consumption estimate, and consequently fish became the main krill consumers. Nonetheless, only 74% of local krill production was consumed by predators, suggesting that there are additional mortality sources that we did not explicitly model. We developed further models to explore scenarios incorporating plausible climate-driven reductions in krill biomass. In scenarios with unchanged predator diets, an 80% reduction in krill biomass resulted in a 73% reduction in vertebrate biomass. However, when predators with diverse diets were able to switch to feeding on alternative zooplankton prey, total vertebrate biomass was maintained at current levels. Scenarios in which 80% of krill biomass was replaced with copepod biomass required 28% more primary production because the estimated consumption rate of copepods is higher than that of krill. The additional copepod biomass did not alter the consequences for vertebrates. These scenarios illustrate the wide range of potential consequences of a shift from a krill to a copepod dominated system in a warming climate. They suggest that both maintenance and dramatic reduction of vertebrate production are plausible outcomes, although the former requires major changes in predator diets. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Euphausiids play a crucial role in the trophodynamics of the ecosystem, and their status under future environmental scenarios is the subject of much concern. Thysanoessa macrura is the most widely distributed, numerically abundant, and ubiquitous euphausiid south of the Polar Front and may be an underappreciated prey species. T. macrura is eurythermic and may be better able to tolerate warming ocean temperatures in comparison to the more stenothermic Antarctic krill Euphausia superba. We use temperature-dependent growth models and biomass per recruit to investigate how the availability of this euphausiid to predators may change under a range of temperature scenarios. We contrast this with the availability of E. superba and find that, under some ranges of temperature change, increasing T. macrura growth may be able to partially compensate for decreasing E. superba growth in terms of biomass available for predators. However, in spite of its considerable biomass, other aspects of this species, such as its size and habitat, may limit its potential to replace E. superba in the diet of many predators.																	0171-8630	1616-1599				FEB 8	2018	588						59	70		10.3354/meps12460							WOS:000426258100005

End-to-end in Southern Ocean ecosystems	CURRENT OPINION IN ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY												Southern Ocean ecosystems matter for us all because they are important in Earth System processes and contribute to food security; they are also undergoing some of the most rapid changes being seen anywhere on the planet. The changes are not uniform, with warming in some regions and cooling in others, and the ecological effects being observed in these areas also vary. These changes need to be interpreted in the context of historical changes generated by harvesting of marine mammals, fish and Antarctic krill at various times over the last two centuries. To examine the relative importance of the factors that determine ecosystem structure and functioning requires integrated analyses of whole ecosystem operation from 'end-to-end' (microbes to whales and from small (<10 km) to circumpolar scales). We present a perspective that highlights the urgent need for concerted action, and that analyses of Southern Ocean ecosystems have relevance for analyses of ecosystems across the global ocean.																	1877-3435	1877-3443				JUL	2012	4	3					264	271		10.1016/j.cosust.2012.05.005							WOS:000307419000003

CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												A multidisciplinary approach incorporating otolith chemistry, age data, and numerical Lagrangian particle simulations indicated a single, self-recruiting population of Antarctic toothfish (Dissostichus mawsoni) in the Southeast Pacific Basin (SPB) and Ross Sea, with a life history structured by the large-scale circulation. Chemistry deposited prior to capture along otolith edges demonstrated strong environmental heterogeneity, yet the chemistry in otolith nuclei, deposited during early life, showed no differences. Age data showed only adult fish in catches on the Pacific-Antarctic Ridge in the SPB and structuring of life stages consistent with transport pathways from the northern Ross Sea. Lagrangian particle simulations predicted that early life stages following the flow in the SPB would be transported to areas in the Ross Sea where juveniles are caught, whereas the circulation would facilitate adult movement along the shelf slope and back into the SPB where spawning adults are caught. These results suggest that successfully spawning fish spend only a part of their adult life history in the Ross Sea, areas in the eastern Ross Sea contribute disproportionately to the spawning population, and areas in the southwestern Ross Sea may supply fisheries in the southern Indian Ocean.

Particle flux on the continental shelf in the Amundsen Sea Polynya and Western Antarctic Peninsula	ELEMENTA-SCIENCE OF THE ANTHROPOCENE												We report results from a yearlong, moored sediment trap in the Amundsen Sea Polynya (ASP), the first such time series in this remote and productive ecosystem. Results are compared to a long-term (1992-2013) time series from the western Antarctic Peninsula (WAP). The ASP trap was deployed from December 2010 to December 2011 at 350 m depth. We observed two brief, but high flux events, peaking at 8 and 5 mmol C m(-2) d(-1) in January and December 2011, respectively, with a total annual capture of 315 mmol C m(-2). Both peak fluxes and annual capture exceeded the comparable WAP observations. Like the overlying phytoplankton bloom observed during the cruise in the ASP (December 2010 to January 2011), particle flux was dominated by Phaeocystis antarctica, which produced phytodetrital aggregates. Particles at the start of the bloom were highly depleted in C-13, indicating their origin in the cold, CO2-rich winter waters exposed by retreating sea ice. As the bloom progressed, microscope visualization and stable isotopic composition provided evidence for an increasing contribution by zooplankton fecal material. Incubation experiments and zooplankton observations suggested that fecal pellet production likely contributed 10-40% of the total flux during the first flux event, and could be very high during episodic krill swarms. Independent estimates of export from the surface (100 m) were about 5-10 times that captured in the trap at 350 m. Estimated bacterial respiration was sufficient to account for much of the decline in the flux between 50 and 350 m, whereas zooplankton respiration was much lower. The ASP system appears to export only a small fraction of its production deeper than 350 m within the polynya region. The export efficiency was comparable to other polar regions where phytoplankton blooms were not dominated by diatoms.

Euphausia superba is limited to the Southern Ocean, while M. norvegica is present from the Arctic Ocean to the Mediterranean Sea. Euphausia superba structural lipids showed little mesoscale variability. Specific differences between phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine fatty acid composition exceeded variability related to sampling stations. On a larger scale (Southern Ocean), fatty acid composition of both total polar lipids and phosphatidylcholine confirmed the reduced level of regional variability. Similar comparisons between female M. norvegica collected at two extreme sites in terms of temperature regime (Kattegat and Ligurian Sea) during two season (spring-summer and fall-winter) suggested a more complex picture. Levels of phosphatidylethanolamine, lysophosphatidylcholine. and diphosphatidylglycerol showed significant differences between sites. During spring-summer, a lower content of phosphatidylethanolamine and lysophosphatidylcholine was observed for the Ligurian Sea population. Fatty acid composition of total polar lipids was significantly different at both sites. Comparisons between spring-summer populations at both sites showed higher percentages of 22:6n-3 and a lower content in saturated and monoenoic acids for the Ligurian Sea, suggesting some degree of adaptation to temperature regime.

Total mercury concentrations in body feather samples of birds caught at their breeding colonies were determined. Among the species, grey-headed albatross (8933 ng g(-1)) and southern giant petrel (7774 ng g(-1)) showed the highest, and gentoo penguin (948 ng g(-1)) the lowest body feather mercury concentrations. Mercury levels were negatively correlated with the proportion of crustaceans (mainly krill) in the species' diets, suggesting that the trophic level is the most important factor in explaining the variation of mercury concentrations in Antarctic seabirds. In 4 species studied for age effects among adult birds (grey-headed and black-browed albatross, northern and southern giant petrel), no age-dependent variation in mercury levels was found. Sex differences were also assessed: female gentoo penguins had lower mercury levels than males, which may be related to the elimination of part of the mercury body burden by females into eggs. In contrast, northern giant petrel males had lower levels than females, which may be related to a higher consumption by males of carrion from Antarctic fur seals. In grey-headed albatrosses, mercury levels were 113 % higher than in 1989, when this species was investigated at the same site, indicating a possible increase in mercury pollution of the Southern Ocean during the last decade.

The diet of the Weddell seal Leptonychotes weddellii at Laurie Island, South Orkney Islands	POLAR BIOLOGY												The diet of the Weddell seal Leptonychotes weddellii at the South Orkney Islands was investigated by the analysis of 44 and 26 faecal samples collected from the beaches of Laurie Island from May 1999 to January 2000 and from October to December 2001, respectively. The diet was diverse and both pelagic and benthic-demersal organisms were represented in the samples. Fish were the most frequent prey of the samples in both seasons, and fish and krill were the most numerous prey items. Octopods predominated by mass in 1999, whereas krill constituted the bulk of the diet in 2001, a fact that was not observed previously. Among fish, Gobionotothen gibberifrons was largely the species that contributed mostly to the diet, whereas pelagic fish could not be identified in the samples. The results are compared with information from other study areas and discussed in relation to the consumption of krill.					di prinzio, cecilia/0000-0002-3561-4307												0722-4060					JUN	2009	32	6					833	838		10.1007/s00300-009-0583-8							WOS:000266052000002

The seasonal evolution of shelf water masses around Bouvetoya, a sub-Antarctic island in the mid-Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean, determined from an instrumented southern elephant seal	POLAR RESEARCH												Our study makes use of a fortuitous oceanographic data set collected around the remote sub-Antarctic island of Bouvetoya by a conductivity - temperature - depth recorder (CTD) integrated with a satellite-relayed data logger deployed on an adult female southern elephant seal (Mirounga leonina) to describe the seasonal evolution of the western shelf waters. The instrumented seal remained in waters over the shelf for 259 days, collecting an average of 2.6 (+/-0.06) CTD profiles per day, providing hydrographic data encompassing the late austral summer and the entire winter. These data document the thermal stratification of the upper water layer due to summer surface heating of the previous year's Antarctic Surface Water, giving way to a cold subsurface layer at about 100 m as the austral winter progressed, with a concomitant increase in salinity of the upper layer. Upper Circumpolar Deep Water was detected at a depth of approximately 200 m along the western shelf of Bouvetoya throughout the year. These oceanographic data represent the only seasonal time series for this region and the second such animal - instrument oceanographic time series in the sub-Antarctic domain of the Southern Ocean.

Factors affecting time spent at the surface or at depth in a prey patch are likely to alter foraging effort, net energy gain, and fitness. We specifically examined the energetic consequences of a demonstrated reduction in dive duration caused by vessel proximity, and of krill density reductions potentially resulting from krill exploitation or climate change. We estimated net energy gain over a simulated 10h foraging bout under baseline conditions, and three scenarios, reflecting krill density reductions, vessel interactions of different amplitudes, and their combined effects. Generally, the magnitude of the effects increased with that of krill density reductions and duration of vessel proximity. They were also smaller when peak densities were more accessible, i.e., nearer to the surface. Effect size from a reduction in krill density on net energy gain were deemed small to moderate at 5% krill reduction, moderate to large at 10% reduction, and large at 25 and 50% reductions. Vessels reduced cumulated net energy gain by as much as 25% when in proximity for 3 of a 10-h daylight foraging period, and by up to 47-85% when continuously present for 10 h. The impacts of vessel proximity on net energy gain increased with their duration. They were more important when whales were precluded from reaching the most beneficial peak densities, and when these densities were located at deeper depths. When krill densities were decreased by 5% or more, disturbing foraging blue whales for 3 h could reduce their net energy gain by >30%. For this endangered western North Atlantic blue whale population, a decrease in net energy gain through an altered krill preyscape or repeated vessel interactions is of particular concern, as this species relies on a relatively short feeding season to accumulate energy reserves and to fuel reproduction. This study highlights the importance of distance limits during whale-watching operations to ensure efficient feeding, as well as the vulnerability of this specialist to fluctuations in krill densities.

J	WILLIAMS, TD				WILLIAMS, TD			FORAGING ECOLOGY AND DIET OF GENTOO PENGUINS PYGOSCELIS-PAPUA AT SOUTH GEORGIA DURING WINTER AND AN ASSESSMENT OF THEIR WINTER PREY CONSUMPTION	IBIS												Estimates of prey consumption by seabird predators in the Sub-Antarctic have so far been based on data obtained from breeding season studies only. This paper describes the diet, foraging activity and population size of Gentoo Penguins Pygoscelis papua during two austral winters, 1987 and 1988, at Bird Island, South Georgia, and estimates prey consumption by the South Georgia population during winter. Antarctic krill Euphausia superba was the main prey species taken, forming 87% or more (by weight) of the diet in September 1987 and May-September 1988, when the total sample weights were 320-670 g. In July-August 1987, crustaceans formed 87% of the diet of females but fish formed 83% of the diet of males, and total sample weights were about 125-200 g. A greater variety of prey was taken in July-August 1987. These differences may have reflected low availability of krill around South Georgia, within the bird's foraging area, during part of the 1987 winter. Reasons for the sex difference in diet are discussed: Gentoo Penguins show sexual dimorphism in bill size, and males are larger and may be better able to catch fish prey. The main fish species taken were Nototheniops larseni and Champsocephalus gunnari. Mean foraging trip duration (in July) varied between 5.3 and 6.9 hours and foraging trip frequency (trips/day) between 0.76 and 0.83. The estimated minimum weight of all prey consumed in winter by the South Georgia population of 311,266 birds (64% adult, 22% first-years (fledglings )and 14% immatures) was 11.2 x 10(3) and 19.6 x 10(3) tonnes in 1987 and 1988, respectively. This comprised 60% krill, 6% other crustaceans and 34% fish in 1987, and 98% krill and 2% fish in 1988. Adults accounted for 64% of all prey consumed. The estimate of winter prey consumption is compared to values derived from breeding season studies and to commercial krill fishery catches.																	0019-1019					JAN	1991	133	1					3	13		10.1111/j.1474-919X.1991.tb04803.x							WOS:A1991EU69800001

J	Williams, GD; Nicol, S; Raymond, B; Meiners, K				Williams, G. D.; Nicol, S.; Raymond, B.; Meiners, K.			Summertime mixed layer development in the marginal sea ice zone off the Mawson coast, East Antarctica	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY												Two small-scale Antarctic marine ecosystem surveys were conducted offshore from the Mawson coast (61-66 degrees E), in the austral summers of January 2001 and 2003. Striking differences were observed in the state of the marine ecosystem between the surveys; in particular krill abundance and penguin breeding success were significantly lower in 2003. In this paper we examine the variability in the physical oceanography between the two surveys, and identify the development of the summer mixed layer (SML) as the key physical process influencing the differences in ecological conditions. The mixed layer in 2003 was warmer, fresher and reduced in both dissolved oxygen content and fluorescence relative to 2001. In 2001 the mean mixed-layer depth was 68.5 +/- 12.4m. In 2003, the mean mixed-layer depth was 33.8 +/- 11.2 m, and increased through the remaining 14 days of the survey. The SML in 2003 was underdeveloped by over a month relative to the 2001 hydrography and we relate this to the seasonal variability in the pattern and timing of sea-ice melt. AVHRR satellite images show a region of fast ice against the Mawson coast that had greater spatial and temporal extent in 2003. We conclude that delayed mixed layer development due to persistent sea ice is likely to have a negative impact on the marine ecosystem of the Antarctic shelf. This may have important implications for predicting the impact of future variability in the sea-ice growth/melt transition due to climate change. Crown Copyright (C) 2007 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Sars" from 19 February to 27 March 2008. The salp's in situ target strength (TS), size, number of individuals in aggregate chains, and chain angle of orientation were determined. Shipboard measurements were made of Salpa thompsoni's material properties. Individual aggregates were mostly 45.5-60.6 mm in mean length; relatively rare solitaries were similar to 100 mm. Chains ranged from 3 to at least 121 individuals, and in surface waters (<20 m), they showed no preferred angle of orientation. Sound-speed contrast (h) ranged from 1.0060 to 1.0201 and density contrast (g) estimates between 1.0000 and 1.0039. The in situ TS distributions peaked between 275 and 276 dB at 38 kHz, with a secondary peak at approximately 265 dB. TS ranged between 285 and 265 dB at 120 and 200 kHz and peaked around 274 dB. The measured in situ TS of salps reasonably matched the theoretical scattering-model predictions based on multi-individual chains. The backscattering from aggregate salps gives rise to TS values that can be similar to krill and other zooplankton with higher density and sound-speed contrasts.

J	Kock, KH				Kock, KH			Antarctic icefishes (Channichthyidae): a unique family of fishes. A review, Part I	POLAR BIOLOGY												Icefish or white-blooded fish are a family of species, unique among vertebrates in that they possess no haemoglobin. With the exception of one species which occurs on the southern Patagonian shelf, icefish live only in the cold-stable and oxygen-rich environment of the Southern Ocean. It is still questionable how old icefish are in evolutionary terms: they may not be older than 6 Ma, i.e. they evolved well after the Southern Ocean started to cool down or they are 15-20 Ma old and started to evolve some time after the formation of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current. Individuals of most icefish species with the exception of species of the genus Champsocephalus have been found down to 700-800 m depth, a few even down to more than 1,500 m. Icefish have been shown to present organ-level adaptations on different levels to compensate for the 'disadvantages' of lacking respiratory pigments. These include a low metabolic rate, well perfused gills, increased blood volume, increased cardiac output, cutaneous uptake of oxygen, increased blood flow with low viscosity, enlarged capillaries, large heart, and increased skin vascularity. Biological features, such as reproduction and growth, are not unique and are comparable to other notothenioids living in the same environment. Icefish produce large yolky eggs which have a diameter of more than 4 mm in most species. Consequently, the number of eggs produced is comparatively small and exceeds 10,000-20,000 eggs in only a few cases. With the exception of species of the genus Champsocephalus which mature at an age of 3 to 4 years, icefish do not attain maturity before they are 5-8 years old. Spawning period of most icefish species is autumn-winter. The incubation period spans from 2 to 3 months in the north of the Southern Ocean to more than 6 months close to the continent. Growth in icefish to the extent it is known is fairly rapid. They grow 6-10 cm in length per annum before they reach spawning maturity. Icefish feed primarily on krill and fish. Some icefish species were abundant enough to be exploited by commercial fisheries, primarily in the 1970s and 1980s with Champsocephalus gunnari as the main target species. Most stocks of this species had been overexploited by the beginning of the 1990s, some had further declined due to natural causes. Other species taken as by-catch species in fisheries were Chaenocephalus aceratus, Pseudochaenichthys georgianus, and Chionodraco rastrospinosus. Chaenodraco wilsoni was the only species exploited on a commercial scale in the high-Antarctic.																	0722-4060	1432-2056				OCT	2005	28	11					862	895		10.1007/s00300-005-0019-z							WOS:000233324600007

Malnutrition is one of the main causes of children's short stature; therefore, nutritional intervention in adolescence is the key to prevent short stature. The peptides from Antarctic Krill (AKPs), the ideal protein model, act in bone formation and anti-osteoporosis. However, the studies on promoting longitudinal bone growth by AKPs have not been reported. Methods: Three-week-old male ICR mice, to construct the adolescent mice model, randomly divided into three groups: normal group, casein group (casein, 300 mg/kgmiddotBW), and AKPs group (AKPs, 300 mg/kgmiddotBW). After 21 days of drug administration, the effects of AKPs on serum biochemical indexes and femur histomorphology of mice, and the mechanism of AKPs promoting longitudinal bone growth was discussed. Results: AKPs significantly increased longitudinal bone growth and improved bone strength. In addition, AKPs remarkably promoted proliferation and hypertrophy of chondrocytes in the growth plate. The further mechanism revealed that AKPs increased serum Growth Hormone (GH) and Insulin-Like Growth Factors-1(IGF-1) contents, which activated the downstream GH/IGF-1 axis signaling pathways. Moreover, AKPs induced the secretion and expression of bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP2) and triggered the activation of BMP2-dependent Smads signaling. AKPs also activated Wnt/beta-catenin signaling, and synergistically activated the expression of Runt-related transcription factor 2 (Runx 2) and Osterix (OSX). Conclusion: AKPs promoted longitudinal bone growth by activating GH/IGF-1 axis, BMP-2/Smads and Wnt/beta-catenin pathways, suggesting AKPs to be a potential nutrient fortifier for longitudinal bone growth.

The gene encoding this beta-galactosidase has been PCR amplified, cloned, expressed in Escherichia coli purified, and characterized. The enzyme is active as a homotetrameric protein, and each monomer consists of 1028 amino acid residues. The enzyme was purified to homogeneity (50% recovery of activity) by using the fast, two-step procedure, including affinity chromatography oil PABTG-Sepharose. Enzymatic properties of the recombinant protein are identical to those of native Psendoalteromonas sp. 22b beta-galactosidase. The enzyme is cold-adapted and at 10degreesC retains 20% of maximum activity. The purified enzyme displayed maximum activity close to 40degreesC and at pH of 6.0-8.0. PNPG was its preferred substrate (58% higher activity than against ONPG). The enzyme was particularly thermolabile, losing all activities within 10min at 50degreesC. The hydrolysis of lactose in a milk assay revealed that 90% of milk lactose was hydrolyzed during 6 h at 30degreesC and during 28 h at 15degreesC. Because of its attributes, the recombinant Pseudoalteromonas sp. 22b beta-galactosidase could be applied at refrigeration temperatures for production of lactose-reduced dairy products.

J	Nelson, MM; Phleger, CF; Mooney, BD; Nichols, PD				Nelson, MM; Phleger, CF; Mooney, BD; Nichols, PD			Lipids of gelatinous Antarctic zooplankton: Cnidaria and Ctenophora	LIPIDS												Antarctic gelatinous zooplankton, including Cnidaria (Calycopsis borchgrevinki, Diphyes antarctica, Stygiomedusa gigantea, Atolla wyvillei, Dimophyes arctica) and Ctenophora (Beroe cucumis, B. forskalii, Pleurobrachia pileus, Bolinopsis infundibulum) were collected near Elephant Island, South Shetland Islands, during January and February 1997 and 1998. Total lipid was low in all zooplankton (0.1-5 mg g(-1) wet mass) and included primarily polar lipids (59-96% of total lipid). Triacylglycerols were 0-26% of total lipids, and wax esters were 0-11% in all species. Cholesterol was the major sterol in all Cnidaria (50-63% of total sterols) whereas in most ctenophores it was lower at 26-45%. These cholesterol levels are consistent with a combined carnivorous and phytoplanktivorous diet in the ctenophores, with the carnivorous diet more dominant in the Cnidaria. Other sterols included primarily trans-dehydrocholesterol, desmosterol, 24-methylcholest-5,22E-dien-3 beta-ol, 24-nordehydrocholesterol, and 24-methylenecholesterol. Total stanols were 0-6% in all zooplankton. Eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid were the major polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) in all samples (7-25% of total fatty acids) except for A. wyvillei in which docosapentaenoic acid was 10% of total fatty acids. The PUFA 18:5n-3 was not detected in 1997 samples, but constituted 0.2-0.8% in most 1998 samples. Monounsaturated fatty acids included primarily 18:1n-9c, 16:1n-7c, and 18:1n-7c. The principal saturated fatty acids in all samples were 16:0, 18:0, and 14:0. These data are the first fdr many of these zooplankton species and the first sterol data for most species. The use of the signature lipid approach has enabled examination of aspects of trophodynamics not obtainable by conventional techniques.

Composition and structure of macrozooplankton and micronekton communities in the vicinity of free-drifting Antarctic icebergs	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY												Recent warming warming in the Antarctic has led to increased production of icebergs: however, the ecological effects of icebergs on pelagic communities within the Southern Ocean have not been well-studied. We used a 10 m(2) MOCNESS to collect macrozooplankton and micronekton in the upper 300 m of the water column near free-drifting icebergs in the Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean during three seasons: December 2005 (late spring), June 2008 (late fall) and March-April 2009 (late summer). Communities were dominated in all three seasons by Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) and salps (Salpa thompsoni), which collectively comprised 60-95% of the community wet biomass in most cases. During our spring and summer cruises, mean biomass was elevated by 3.1-4.3x at a distance of 0.37 km from large icebergs vs. 9.26 km away. These differences were not statistically significant, and no trend in biomass with distance was apparent in samples from fall 2008, when total biomass was an order of magnitude lower. Biomass levels near icebergs during Dec 2005 and Mar-Apr 2009 were comparable to values reported from marginal ice zones, suggesting that waters around icebergs support macrozooplankton and micronekton communities comparable in magnitude to those in some of the most productive areas of the Southern Ocean. Sample variance also was significantly higher within 1.85 km of icebergs during Dec 2005 and Mar-Apr 2009, reflecting increased patchiness on scales sampled by the MOCNESS (20-40 x 10(3) m(3) filtered per sample). This pattern was not significant during Jun 2008. Large predatory medusae were observed within 1.85 km of icebergs and in Iceberg Alley, an area through which icebergs pass frequently, but were virtually absent in areas remote from icebergs. Small euphausiids showed an inverse distribution, with low densities in areas populated by large medusae. A shift in community composition from a near-iceberg assemblage dominated by herbivores to a carnivore-dominated community in Iceberg Alley may reflect a transition from bottom-up to top-down control with increasing distance and time. Body sizes of dominant species varied seasonally but did not show consistent trends with distance from icebergs. Concentrations of photosynthetic pigments in the guts of E. superba and S. thompsoni corresponded broadly to patterns in surface chlorophyll a concentrations and were comparable to maximum gut pigment concentrations measured in animals collected from highly productive marginal ice zones. Our results suggest that the macrozooplankton and micronekton assemblages near free-drifting icebergs can be quantitatively and qualitatively different from those in surrounding, iceberg-free waters, perhaps due to both bottom-up and top-down processes as well as physical forcing by the passage of a large object through the upper ocean.

This is one of the first reports to document the concentrations of PCDDs/DFs in polar bear livers from Alaska, and in penguin and skua eggs from Antarctica. Concentrations of total PCDD/DFs in livers of polar bears ranged from 8 to 66 (mean: 26) pg/g, on a lipid weight basis. Concentrations of total PCDD/DFs in Antarctic samples were in the increasing order on a lipid weight basis; weddell seal liver (8.9 pg/g) < fish (11-17 pg/g) < krill (27 pg/g) < penguin eggs (mean: 23 pg/g) < south polar skua eggs (mean: 181 pg/g). Concentrations of dioxin-like PCBs (including two di-ortho congeners) in polar bear livers were in the range of 1080-3930 ng/g, lipid wt. Concentrations of dioxin-like PCBs in Antarctic samples were in the following order on a lipid weight basis; south polar skua eggs (mean: 1440 ng/g) > > penguin eggs (30 ng/g) > seal liver (57 ng/g) >fishes (6.2 ng/g) > krill (0.9 ng/g). Concentrations of 2378-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin equivalents (TEQs) calculated based on the WHO TEFs were higher in the eggs of polar skua (mean: 344; range: 220-650 pg/g, lipid wt.) from Antarctica than in polar bear livers from Alaska (mean: 120; range: 69-192 pg/g). In general, concentrations of PCDFs were greater than those of PCDDs in polar organisms. 23478-PeCDF is one of the dominant congener found in several samples. Concentrations of TEQs in polar bear livers and skua eggs were close to those that may cause adverse health effects. Dioxin-like PCBs, particularly, non-ortho coplanar PCBs were the major contributors to TEQ concentrations in penguin and skua eggs whereas mono-ortho PCBs accounted for a major portion of TEQs in polar bear livers.

Krillase exhibits both endo- and exopeptidase activity but has no microbicidal effect. In model systems with pure cultures of oral microorganisms, Krillase demonstrated inhibition of microbial adhesion to saliva-coated hydroxyapatite. Furthermore, a protocol for the growth of reproducible in vitro plaque films has been developed, and effects of Krillase on the plaque film were investigated by means of scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The results showed that Krillase efficiently released microorganisms from plaque in vitro, the effect being dependent on the enzymatic activity. The surface energy of the substratum had a minor influence on the formation and removal of plaque in vitro. Ellipsometric studies on the formation and enzymatic removal of a salivary pellicle indicated that the enzymatic effect on plaque may partly depend on degradation of the salivary pellicle. Krillase was also able to remove plaque accumulated oil dentures in vivo. Our results demonstrate the potential or Krillase for plaque control, and that these enzymes are worthy of further investigations including clinical studies and work to find a suitable vehicle.																	0909-8836	1600-0722				OCT	2001	109	5					316	324									WOS:000171699000005	11695752

Evidence of heterogeneous feeding patterns of east coast of Australia migrating humpback whales has been observed, warranting a comprehensive assessment of interannual variability in their diet. We examined the lipid and fatty acid profiles of individuals of the east coast of Australia migrating stock sampled between 2008 and 2018. The use of live-sampled blubber biopsies showed that fatty acid profiles varied significantly among all years. The two trophic indicator fatty acids for Antarctic krill, 20:5.3 and 22:6 omega 3 remained largely unchanged across the 10-year period, suggesting that Antarctic krill is the principal prey item. A distance-based linear model showed that 33% of the total variation in fatty acid profiles was explained by environmental variables and climate indices. Most of the variation was explained by the Southern Annular Mode (23.7%). The high degree of variability observed in this study was unexpected for a species that is thought to feed primarily on one prey item. We propose that the observed variability likely arises from changes in the diet of Antarctic krill rather than changes in the whale's diet.

J	Croll, DA; Tershy, BR				Croll, DA; Tershy, BR			Penguins, fur seals, and fishing: prey requirements and potential competition in the South Shetland Islands, Antarctica	POLAR BIOLOGY												Antarctic and sub-Antarctic seabirds, marine mammals, and human fisheries concentrate their foraging efforts on a single species, Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba). Because these predators may have a significant effect on krill abundance, we estimated the energy and prey requirements of Adelie (Pygoscelis adeliae), chinstrap (Pygoscelis antarctica), and gentoo (Pygoscelis papua) penguins and female Antarctic fur seals (Arctocephalus gazella) breeding on the South Shetland Islands, Antarctica and compared these estimates with catch statistics from the Antarctic krill fishery. Published data on field metabolic rate, population size, diet, prey energy content, and metabolic efficiency were used to estimate prey requirements of these breeding, adult, land-based predators and their dependent offspring. Due to their large population size, chinstrap penguins were the most significant krill predators during the period examined, consuming an estimated 7.8 x 10(8) kg krill, followed by Adelie penguins (3.1 x 10(7) kg), gentoo penguins (1.2 x 10(7) kg), and Antarctic fur seals (3.6 x 10(6) kg). Total consumption of all land-based predators on the South Shetland Islands was estimated at 8.3 x 10(8) kg krill. The commercial krill fishery harvest in the South Shetland Island region (1.0 x 10(8) kg) was approximately 12% of this. Commercial harvest coincides seasonally and spatially with peak penguin and fur seal prey demands, and may affect prey availability to penguins and fur seals. This differs from the conclusions of Ichii et al. who asserted that the potential for competition between South Shetland predators and the commercial krill fishery is low.																	0722-4060					JUN	1998	19	6					365	374		10.1007/s003000050261							WOS:000073931800001

First documentation of leopard seal predation of South Georgia pintail duck	POLAR BIOLOGY												Leopard seals are regular winter visitors to Bird Island, South Georgia, where they mostly prey on fur seals and penguins, and to a lesser extent on Antarctic krill and fish. Leopard seals can exploit many different species, but there are no records of predation on flying shorebirds in the wild. On 4 October 2008, an individually identified juvenile leopard seal female was observed killing and eating a South Georgia Pintail duck. It also preyed on Antarctic fur seals and gentoo and macaroni penguins during its 2-month temporary residency around the island. The varied diet of this seal exemplifies the generalist prey utilization typical of its species. Long-term diet studies at Bird Island and the published record suggest that predation on ducks is a rather exceptional finding; individual ducks are more likely to escape leopard seal attacks than penguins and provide a far less substantial ration. This note documents the first observation of this species of duck in the diet of leopard seals.

J	Kock, KH				Kock, KH			Antarctic icefishes (Channichthyidae): a unique family of fishes. A review, Part II	POLAR BIOLOGY												Icefish or white- blooded fish are a family of species unique among vertebrates in that they possess no haemoglobin. With the exception of one species which occurs on the southern Patagonian shelf, icefish live only in the cold-stable and oxygen-rich environment of the Southern Ocean. It is still questionable how old icefish are in evolutionary terms: they may not be older than 6 Ma, i.e. they evolved well after the Southern Ocean started to cool down or they are 15-20 Ma old and started to evolve some time after the formation of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current. Individuals of most icefish species with the exception of species of the genus Champsocephalus have been found down to 700-800 m depth, a few even down to more than 1,500 in. Icefish have been shown to present organ-level adaptations on different levels to compensate for the 'disadvantages' of lacking respiratory pigments. These include a low metabolic rate, well perfused gills, increased blood volume, increased cardiac output, cutaneous uptake of oxygen, increased blood flow with low viscosity, enlarged capillaries, large heart, and increased skin vascularity. Biological features, such as reproduction and growth, are not unique and are comparable to other notothenioids living in the same environment. Icefish produce large yolky eggs which have a diameter of more than 4 mm in most species. Consequently, the number of eggs produced is comparatively small and exceeds 10,000-20,000 eggs in only a few cases. With the exception of species of the genus Champsocephalus which mature at an age of 3 to 4 years, icefish do not attain maturity before they are 5-8 years old. Spawning period of most icefish species is autumn-winter. The incubation period spans from 2 to 3 months in the north of the Southern Ocean to more than 6 months close to the continent. Growth in icefish to the extent it is known is fairly rapid. They grow 610 cm in length per annum before they reach spawning maturity. Icefish feed primarily on krill and fish. Some icefish species were abundant enough to be exploited by commercial fisheries, primarily in the 1970s and 1980s with Champsocephalus gunnari as the main target species. Most stocks of this species had been overexploited by the beginning of the 1990s, some had further declined due to natural causes. Other species taken as by-catch species in fisheries were Chaenocephalus aceratus, Pseudochaenichthys georgianus, and Chionodraco rastrospinosus. Chaenodraco wilsoni was the only species exploited on a commercial scale in the high-Antarctic.																	0722-4060	1432-2056				NOV	2005	28	12					897	909		10.1007/s00300-005-0020-6							WOS:000233876100001

Antarctic seabirds are vulnerable to all these threats because they depend on terrestrial and marine environments to breed and forage. We assess the current distribution and total abundance of Adelie penguins in East Antarctica and find there are 3.5 (95% CI 2.9-4.2) million individuals of breeding age along the East Antarctic coastline and 5.9 (4.2-7.7) million individuals foraging in the adjacent ocean after the breeding season. One third of the breeding population numbering over 1 million individuals breed within 10 km of research stations, highlighting the potential for human activities to impact Adelie penguin populations despite their current high abundance. The 16 Antarctic Specially Protected Areas currently designated in East Antarctica offer protection to breeding populations close to stations in four of six regional populations. The East Antarctic breeding population consumes an average of 193 500 tonnes of krill and 18 800 tonnes of fish during a breeding season, with consumption peaking at the end of the breeding season. These findings can inform future conservation management decisions in the terrestrial environment under the Protocol on Environmental Protection to develop a systematic network of protected areas, and in the marine environment under the Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources to allow the consumption needs of Adelie penguins to be taken into account when setting fishery catch limits. Extending this work to other penguin, flying seabird, seal and whale species is a priority for conservation management in Antarctica and the Southern Ocean. (C) 2016 The Authors.

Feeding, fasting and foraging success during chick rearing in macaroni penguins	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												Foraging behaviour and energy expenditure were measured continuously throughout the chick-rearing period of free-ranging macaroni penguins Eudyptes chrysolophus. These data were integrated with values obtained from the literature on body mass, assimilation efficiency, body reserve consumption and deposition rates, chick growth and energy expenditure and energy content of food in a new type of algorithm to predict (with 95% confidence limits [CL]) foraging success and daily changes in body mass. A successfully breeding pair of macaroni penguins will capture 111.7 kg (95% CL: 79.4 to 158.0 kg) of prey during the chick-rearing period. The crucial phase of the chick rearing period was around the time that chicks creche, when prey consumption rates more than doubled as the male assisted in foraging and recovered from a long fast. Female macaroni penguins extracted 2.28 (1.60 to 3.26) and males extracted 2.84 (2.02 to 3.99) g of prey from their environment for every minute spent submerged during foraging. Only 15.3 (14.7 to 15.6)% of all prey consumed was fed to chicks. While food capture rates increase in the middle of the breeding season, this may be more a function of greater food availability than a response to demands from their chick. Male and female macaroni penguins have differing breeding strategies with the male showing the characteristics of a capital then income breeder while the female has a strategy that shows characteristics of both capital and income strategies simultaneously. The high synchronicity and precise timing of the macaroni penguin breeding season and timing of the increase in prey capture rates suggest an influx of prey to their foraging area during the middle of the breeding season. A depletion of prey resources in the foraging area used during the breeding season could affect foraging success and have profound effects on the body condition and composition of this species and its ability to raise chicks successfully.

The German research icebreaker Polarstern operated in heavy pack ice along the Greenwich Meridian between the northern sea ice boundary and the Antartic coast. Crabeater seals (Lobodon carcinophagus), minke whales (Balaenoptera acutorostrata), Adelie penguins (Pygoscelis adeliae), Antarctic petrels (Thalassoica antarctica) and snow petrels (Pagodroma nivea) were found to be more abundant in the vicinity of the submarine Maud Rise, about 700 km north of the continental margin, than in other areas of substantial ice cover traversed during that cruise. The aggregations of birds and mammals are expected to reflect aggregations of their principal food, krill (Euphausia superba) wintering underneath the ice cover. The distribution pattern of krill predators coincides with the course of a warm water belt upwelling near Maud Rise. This upwelling could induce local ice melting which in turn may result in an increased release of sea ice algae.																	0722-4060	1432-2056				SEP	1991	11	5					305	309									WOS:A1991GG91200003

FORAGING-NICHE SEPARATION OF BREEDING GENTOO AND CHINSTRAP PENGUINS, SOUTH SHETLAND ISLANDS, ANTARCTICA	CONDOR												The realized niches of closely related species must differ if these species are to co-exist stably. The Gentoo (Pygoscelis papua) and Chinstrap Penguins (P. antarctica) breed concurrently in the Scotia Sea and Antarctic Peninsula regions. To identify species- and site-specific foraging niches, we compared the two species' foraging niches, including diet and foraging locations, at two sites in the South Shetland Islands with contrasting marine habitats. Both species fed primarily on Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba), though fish was also a component of the Gentoo Penguin's diet. Gentoo Penguins foraged closer to shore than did Chinstrap Penguins. Gentoo Penguins foraged during the day, while Chinstrap Penguins foraged throughout the diet cycle, sometimes traveling farther from shore on overnight foraging trips. In most cases, these species-specific foraging patterns were consistent with trends seen elsewhere in the region. However, within each species, site-specific differences in foraging niches were still evident. Overall, we observed that Gentoo Penguins traveled within consistent and limited distances from their colonies, but their diets varied by site in both meal mass and content. Chinstrap Penguins, in contrast, had a uniform diet of krill at both sites but varied the distance from shore and times at which they foraged.																	0010-5422					NOV	2010	112	4					683	695		10.1525/cond.2010.090221							WOS:000285727700007

Feeding frequencies, feeding rates and meal sizes varied between years, and feeding rates were correlated with data of the Antarctic krill Euphausia superba abundance in the Elephant Island region. The overall breeding success of breeding pairs was low, ranging from 0 to 34%. Snow storms and wind conditions depressed breeding success even in years of good food availability, and snow storms were the most important determinant of the breeding success over the seven seasons. Snow storms during the breeding season occurred during periods of prevailing easterly winds. In addition, the distribution of wind directions was found to strongly influence the krill availability to storm-petrels.

This organism has been used as a model system in many fields of the Antarctic biology. Yet, understanding of the evolutionary Identity of the species, Such as its phylogenetic relationships and divergence time, remains limited. Here, we reconstructed the molecular phylogenies of the species together with two sea urchin species in southernmost South America (Loxechinus albus and Pseudechinus magellanicus), a parechinid species (Paracentrotus lividus) and three strongylocentrotid species (Strongylocentrotus purpuratus, S. intermedius, and Hemicentrotus pulcherrimus) using mitochondrial DNA sequences of 12S r-DNA-tRNA(gln) region (877nt) and cytochrome oxidase Subunit 1 (CO1, 1079nt). The rate of sequence evolution and the divergence time of the species were then estimated from the trees. The phylogenetic trees reveal that S. neumayeri is a sister group to the lineage of L. albus and P lividus, and separated from the lineage 24-35 million years ago (m.y.a.). The divergence between S. neumayeri and L. albus coincides with the separation of Antarctica from South America, suggesting that the tectonic event must have provoked the cladogenesis of the Species through vicariance.																	0954-1020	1365-2079				MAR	2004	16	1					29	36		10.1017/S0954102004001786							WOS:000220310700007

However, alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) from flaxseed oil, which is a short-chain n-3 PUFA, is often promoted in pet feed as a n-3 source, implicitly assuming it is an effective precursor of EPA and DHA. Objective This study was aimed to compare the effect of supplementation with a plant-based short-chain n-3 PUFA source (flaxseed oil, FSO) with a marine long-chain n-3 PUFA source (astaxanthin krill oil, AKO) to increase the Omega-3 Index in dogs. Methods Ten adult Alaskan Huskies of both genders were supplemented daily with 1,155 mg of EPA/DHA from AKO, whereas another 10 dogs received 1,068 mg ALA from flaxseed oil for 6 weeks. Fatty acid and Omega-3 Index measurements of the two groups were taken after 0, 3 and 6 weeks for comparison. Results The EPA and DHA concentrations increased significantly only in the dogs fed with AKO resulting in a significant increase in mean Omega-3 Index, from 1.68% at baseline to 2.7% after 6 weeks of supplementation (p < .0001). On the contrary, both EPA and DHA concentrations decreased significantly in the dogs fed with FSO, which led to a significant decrease in mean Omega-3 Index from 1.6% at baseline to 0.96% at study end (p < .0001). Conclusions The results showed that supplementation of AKO from Antarctic krill led to a significant increase in the Omega-3 Index in comparison to FSO in dogs. This suggests that preformed marine EPA and DHA sources are needed in dog feeds, as the dietary requirements proposed by feed industry organizations are not met with conversion from short-chain n-3 fatty acids.																		2053-1095				MAR	2021	7	2					370	377		10.1002/vms3.369		OCT 2020					WOS:000575316900001	33022896

The study was conducted in the Mertz Glacier Polynya region from July to August 1999. In total 89 crabeater seals were seen in 26 groups which ranged in size from 1 to 35 animals (mean = 3.2). The mean observed haulout density along a 200 m wide strip transect was 0.108 seals per km(2), or 0.042 groups per km(2). Crabeater seals were not uniformly distributed in the polynya but selected areas of stable ice over shallow (< 1000 m) waters. We used a generalized linear model to assess the relationship of seal distribution to the physical attributes of sea ice concentration, thickness, and ocean depth. We found that ice thickness and ocean depth were the most important determinants of seal distribution. Crabeater seals occurred in areas where the ice affords them a stable haulout platform while allowing them access to Antarctic krill that live directly beneath the ice.

Recent years have seen the emergence of large-scale mechanistic explanations-or "paradigms of change"-that attempt to synthesize our understanding of past and current changes. In many cases, these paradigms are based on observations that are spatially and temporally patchy. The West Antarctic Peninsula (WAP), one of Earth's most rapidly changing regions, has been an area of particular research focus. A recently proposed mechanistic explanation for observed changes in the WAP region relates changes in penguin populations to variability in krill biomass and regional warming. While this scheme is attractive for its simplicity and chronology, it may not account for complex spatio-temporal processes that drive ecosystem dynamics in the region. It might also be difficult to apply to other Antarctic regions that are experiencing some, though not all, of the changes documented for the WAP. We use qualitative network models of differing levels of complexity to test paradigms of change for the WAP ecosystem. Importantly, our approach captures the emergent effects of feedback processes in complex ecological networks and provides a means to identify and incorporate uncertain linkages between network elements. Our findings highlight key areas of uncertainty in the drivers of documented trends, and suggest that a greater level of model complexity is needed in devising explanations for ecosystem change in the Southern Ocean. We suggest that our network approach to evaluating a recent and widely cited paradigm of change for the Antarctic region could be broadly applied in hypothesis testing for other regions and research fields.

Crustacea in Arctic and Antarctic sea ice: Distribution, diet and life history strategies	ADVANCES IN MARINE BIOLOGY, VOL 51	Advances in Marine Biology											This review concerns crustaceans that associate with sea ice. Particular emphasis is placed on comparing and contrasting the Arctic and Antarctic sea ice habitats, and the subsequent influence of these environments on the life history strategies of the crustacean fauna. Sea ice is the dominant feature of both polar marine ecosystems, playing a central role in physical processes and providing an essential habitat for organisms ranging in size from viruses to whales. Similarities between the Arctic and Antarctic marine ecosystems include variable cover of sea ice over an annual cycle, a light regimen that can extend from months of total darkness to months of continuous light and a pronounced seasonality in primary production. Although there are many similarities, there are also major differences between the two regions: The Antarctic experiences greater seasonal change in its sea ice extent, much of the ice is over very deep water and more than 80% breaks out each year. In contrast, Arctic sea ice often covers comparatively shallow water, doubles in its extent on an annual cycle and the ice may persist for several decades. Crustaceans, particularly copepods and amphipods, are abundant in the sea ice zone at both poles, either living within the brine channel system of the ice-crystal matrix or inhabiting the ice-water interface. Many species associate with ice for only a part of their life cycle, while others appear entirely dependent upon it for reproduction and development. Although similarities exist between the two faunas, many differences are emerging. Most notable are the much higher abundance and biomass of Antarctic copepods, the dominance of the Antarctic sea ice copepod fauna by calanoids, the high euphausiid biomass in Southern Ocean waters and the lack of any species that appear fully dependent on the ice. In the Arctic, the ice-associated fauna is dominated by amphipods. Calanoid copepods are not tightly associated with the ice, while harpacticoids and cyclopoids are abundant. Euphausiids are nearly absent from the high Arctic. Life history strategies are variable, although reproductive cycles and life spans are generally longer than those for temperate congeners. Species at both poles tend to be opportunistic feeders and periods of diapause or other reductions in metabolic expenditure are not uncommon.

We have studied a unique data set of dates of first arrival and laying of first eggs over a 55-year period for the entire community of Antarctic seabirds in East Antarctica. The records over this long period show a general unexpected tendency toward later arrival and laying, an inverse trend to those observed in the northern hemisphere. Overall, species now arrive at their colonies 9.1 days later, on average, and lay eggs an average of 2.1 days later than in the early 1950s. Furthermore, these delays are linked to a decrease in sea ice extent that has occurred in eastern Antarctica, which underlies the contrasted effects of global climate change on species in Antarctica.

Transcriptomic profiles of spring and summer populations of the Southern Ocean salp, Salpa thompsoni, in the Western Antarctic Peninsula region	POLAR BIOLOGY												The Southern Ocean salp, Salpa thompsoni (Tunicata, Thaliacea), is a pivotal species in the pelagic ecosystem of the Western Antarctic Peninsula (WAP), one of the fastest warming regions of the world oceans. This study produced a complete reference transcriptome for S. thompsoni containing 216,931 sequences; 41,210 (18%) were associated with predicted, hypothetical, or known proteins; 13,058 (6%) were mapped and annotated. Whole-transcriptome (RNA-seq) analysis of 39 samples collected during austral spring and summer 2011 in the WAP and in summer 2009 in the Indian Sector revealed clustering of samples by regions, seasons, and areas (Bray-Curtis similarity). The highest numbers of differentially expressed genes at the 4x, 20x, and 100x fold-change levels were found between salps collected during spring versus summer 2011 in the WAP (analysis of variance, ANOVA). Spring versus summer samples showed significant differential expression of 77 genes associated with environmental stress response and 51 genes associated with sexual reproduction (paired t tests, p < 0.05), with significant association between expression of these genes and temperature at the collection site shown by multidimensional scaling analysis. Gene Ontology (GO) term enrichment analysis identified 41 GO terms responsible for spring versus summer differences, including 156 genes associated with translation (i.e., protein synthesis). The reference transcriptome and characterization of time/space patterns of whole-transcriptome and target gene differential expression provide a foundation for functional analysis and identification of molecular markers of physiological condition, life history events, and responses to climate change in this key species in Antarctic pelagic ecosystems.

Guided by real-time remotely sensed surface current measurements of convergence derived from a network of high-frequency radars (HFRs), we adaptively sample the distribution and biomass of phytoplankton and Antarctic krill, which influence Adelie penguin foraging ecology, to understand how local oceanographic processes structure the ecosystem. The recent application of ocean observing and animal telemetry technology over Palmer Deep has led to new understanding and many new questions related to polar ecosystem processes. The HFR coastal surface current mapping network is uniquely equipped to resolve local circulation patterns over Palmer Deep. The surface current measurements enable identification of regions of convergence and divergence in real time. Guided by these maps, our field study adaptively samples the measured convergence and divergence zones within the context of semi-diurnal and diurnal mixed tidal regimes. The in situ sampling includes (a) a mooring deployment, (b) multiple underwater glider deployments, (c) small boat acoustic surveys of Antarctic krill, and (d) penguin ARGOS-linked satellite telemetry and temperature-depth recorders (TDRs). The combination of real-time surface convergence maps with adaptive in situ sampling introduces HFR to the Antarctic in a way that allows us to rigorously and efficiently test the influence of local tidal processes on top predator foraging ecology.

Use of sea ice by arctic terns Sterna paradisaea in Antarctica and impacts of climate change	JOURNAL OF AVIAN BIOLOGY												Arctic terns spend their breeding and non-breeding seasons in polar environments at opposite ends of the world. The sensitivity of polar regions to climate change makes it essential to understand the ecology of arctic terns but the remoteness of the Antarctic presents a considerable challenge. One solution is to use 'biologgers' to monitor remotely their behaviour and distribution in the Antarctic. Data from birds tagged with light-level global location sensors (geolocators) in 2015 and 2017 showed that a third of their annual cycle was spent amongst Antarctic sea ice. After reaching the East Antarctic in the austral spring, they gradually moved west, foraging in fragmented ice zones of the Antarctic coastline, leaving in the austral autumn for their return northward migration via the Atlantic. Changes in patterns of movement between phases of 24-h daylight and diel day/night conditions were likely linked to the annual moult, and stable isotope analyses suggest that krill (Euphausia species) was an important component of their diet. There were marked differences in movement behaviour between arctic terns tagged in 2015 compared to 2017 that may relate to unusual changes in sea-ice extent. The arctic tern may be unique amongst seabirds that utilise the Antarctic environment in summer in being able to move widely without nesting constraints, and may present a means of characterising the effects of climate change on species dependent for foraging on Antarctic sea-ice and krill.

Flexible reproductive timing can buffer reproductive success of Pygoscelis spp. penguins in the Antarctic Peninsula region	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												Varying the timing of reproduction in response to local environmental conditions is a key factor influencing reproductive success. We used 19 yr (1991 to 2009) of data on breeding chronology and reproductive success of Adelie penguins Pygoscelis adeliae and gentoo penguins P. papua at King George Island, Antarctica to compare clutch initiation dates (CIDs), hatch rates, and creche rates at population and individual levels. The CIDs of both species occurred earlier with warmer October temperatures, but gentoo penguins adjusted CIDs twice as much per C of temperature as Adelie penguins. Gentoo penguins also exhibited lower variances in hatch and creche rates than Adelie penguins, suggesting that greater ability to respond to ambient conditions can buffer reproductive success. Mixed-effects models revealed that individual-and year-specific random effects on the overall population mean best accounted for observed variation in CIDs, with some individuals routinely breeding earlier than others. However, individual differences in the relative timing of breeding provided no advantage for long-term reproductive success. The results suggest that, among gentoo and Adelie penguins, plasticity in CIDs with respect to environmental conditions is primarily a population-level rather than an individual-level response. Energetic constraints of contrasting migratory and fasting behaviors likely contribute to the different abilities to respond to warming spring temperatures. Overall, larger responses of gentoo penguin CIDs to October temperature and lower variability in reproductive success, despite reduced reproductive success with delayed breeding, suggests that gentoo penguins are better equipped than Adelie penguins to adjust to rapid warming in the Antarctic Peninsula ecosystem.				, Jefferson/AAG-1702-2021; Polito, Michael/G-9118-2012	, Jefferson/0000-0002-3600-1414; Polito, Michael/0000-0001-8639-4431												0171-8630	1616-1599					2012	454						91	104		10.3354/meps09633							WOS:000304605500008

An introduction to EASIZ (Ecology of the Antarctic Sea Ice Zone): An integrated programme of water column, benthos and bentho-pelagic coupling in the coastal environment of Antarctica	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY												The EASIZ (Ecology of the Antarctic Sea Ice Zone) programme ran from 1994 to 2004, and involved over 150 scientists from more than 17 countries. The main scientific aim was an integrated study of the water column and benthos, linked by bentho-pelagic coupling, of the Antarctic continental shelf. Because water-column studies were well served by existing international programmes (SO-JGOFS, SO-GLOBEC) and national biological oceanographic programmes, EASIZ itself concentrated on the benthos and bentho-pelagic coupling. Work in the EASIZ programme has led to the overturning of some previous paradigms, for example that the Antarctic is species-poor, and replaced these with a revised picture linking the assemblage structure and population dynamics to the glacial-marine setting. The legacy of EASIZ is a wide-ranging reassessment of the diversity, history and ecology of the Antarctic benthos, the coupling of this system to water-column processes, and a fundamental revision of our view of physiological adaptation to temperature in polar marine organisms.

Here we present body condition and trophic biomarker data (lipid content and stable isotopes of carbon and nitrogen) from 19 zooplankton species collected over five consecutive winters (August and September 2012-2016) around the northern Antarctic Peninsula. We report environmental data (percent sea-ice cover, sea-ice type, water temperature, salinity, and integrated chl-a) as well as species abundance data at each sampling location to provide additional context for interpreting the lipid and stable isotope data. For most species, these are the first winter measurements or time series of body condition, trophic position, and abundance in relation to environmental variables. These data are critical for evaluating changes in ecosystem structure and predator-prey relationships in a region of Antarctica that is warming faster than most other areas on Earth as a result of climate change.

Surface exchange between the Weddell and Scotia Seas	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS												Within Drake Passage, the southern flank of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) hosts the ventilation of deep water, the injection of Antarctic shelf waters and interactions between westward and eastward boundary currents. This exchange is explored through the trajectories of forty surface drifters released in January 2012 in the northwestern Weddell Sea. The drifters detail Lagrangian transport pathways between the eastern Antarctic Peninsula and sites of elevated chlorophyll in the Scotia Sea. ACC frontal currents, in particular the Southern ACC Front, act as dynamical transport barriers to the drifters and influence surface chlorophyll distributions, indicating that ACC fronts partition Weddell source waters in the Scotia Sea. Interannual fluctuations in surface chlorophyll in the south Scotia Sea and the northern Weddell Sea covary. This suggests that Scotia Sea ecosystem dynamics are linked to water properties injected from the tip of the Antarctic Peninsula and respond to Weddell Gyre circulation changes.																	0094-8276	1944-8007				NOV 28	2013	40	22					5920	5925		10.1002/2013GL058114							WOS:000328210600018						
J	Brierley, AS				Brierley, AS			A comparison of Antarctic euphausiids sampled by net and from geothermally heated waters: insights into sampling bias	POLAR BIOLOGY												The Antarctic euphausiids Euphausia superba and E. crystallorophias were sampled using aln 8 m(2) rectangular midwater trawl inside the caldera of Deception Island. Specimens of the same species were collected on the same day from the strandline and sublittoral fringe within the caldera at a bay where these euphausiids had been incapacitated by high temperature geothermally heated waters. Differences between length frequency distributions of samples obtained by both methods were investigated once net-caught specimens had been subject to the simulated effects of geothermally heated waters. Differences between maturity stage/sex ratios for E. superba samples were also assessed. No significant differences between sizes of net-caught or beach-sampled E. crystallorophias were detected, but significant differences were found between both the sizes and sex/maturity stages for E. super ba samples. Possible explanations for these differences are discussed.

Garrett; Barbraud, Christophe; Delord, Karine			Mapping and assessing variability in the Antarctic marginal ice zone, pack ice and coastal polynyas in two sea ice algorithms with implications on breeding success of snow petrels	CRYOSPHERE												Sea ice variability within the marginal ice zone (MIZ) and polynyas plays an important role for phytoplankton productivity and krill abundance. Therefore, mapping their spatial extent as well as seasonal and interannual variability is essential for understanding how current and future changes in these biologically active regions may impact the Antarctic marine ecosystem. Knowledge of the distribution of MIZ, consolidated pack ice and coastal polynyas in the total Antarctic sea ice cover may also help to shed light on the factors contributing towards recent expansion of the Antarctic ice cover in some regions and contraction in others. The long-term passive microwave satellite data record provides the longest and most consistent record for assessing the proportion of the sea ice cover that is covered by each of these ice categories. However, estimates of the amount of MIZ, consolidated pack ice and polynyas depend strongly on which sea ice algorithm is used. This study uses two popular passive microwave sea ice algorithms, the NASA Team and Bootstrap, and applies the same thresholds to the sea ice concentrations to evaluate the distribution and variability in the MIZ, the consolidated pack ice and coastal polynyas. Results reveal that the seasonal cycle in the MIZ and pack ice is generally similar between both algorithms, yet the NASA Team algorithm has on average twice the MIZ and half the consolidated pack ice area as the Bootstrap algorithm. Trends also differ, with the Bootstrap algorithm suggesting statistically significant trends towards increased pack ice area and no statistically significant trends in the MIZ. The NASA Team algorithm on the other hand indicates statistically significant positive trends in the MIZ during spring. Potential coastal polynya area and amount of broken ice within the consolidated ice pack are also larger in the NASA Team algorithm. The timing of maximum polynya area may differ by as much as 5 months between algorithms. These differences lead to different relationships between sea ice characteristics and biological processes, as illustrated here with the breeding success of an Antarctic seabird.

Data were obtained using a single instrument, the hydrobiophysical system Salpa-M, in the area of 50-63 degrees S, 62-49 degrees W in March 2002 (183 soundings at 45 stations during cruise 7 on RV Gorizont) and in February 2020 (122 soundings at 18 stations during cruise 79 on RV Academic Mstislav Keldysh). The bioluminescence studies were coupled with the simultaneous measurement of temperature, electrical conductivity, and photosynthetically active radiation, and they were compared with the data from processing plankton samples. Over the past 20 years, as a consequence of the appearance of a large number of gelatinous organisms and the resulting changes in the structure of the plankton community, the bioluminescence of Antarctic waters in the euphotic layer of this region has decreased almost two-fold, currently being in the range 8.4 x 10(-12) to 104.42 x 10(-12) W center dot cm(-2)center dot L-1.

Complementary use of stable isotopes and fatty acids for quantitative diet estimation of sympatric predators, the Antarctic pack-ice seals	OECOLOGIA												The quantitative use of stable isotopes (SIs) for trophic studies has seen a rapid growth whereas fatty acid (FA) studies remain mostly qualitative. We apply the Bayesian tool MixSIAR to both SI and FA data to estimate the diet of three sympatric predators: the crabeater (Lobodon carcinophaga), Weddell (Leptonychotes weddellii) and leopard seal (Hydrurga leptonyx). We used SI data of their vibrissae and FA data of their outer blubber to produce comparable diet estimates for the same individuals. Both SI and FA models predicted the same main diet components, although the predicted proportions differed. For the crabeater seal, both methods identified krill, Euphausia superba, as the main, and almost exclusive, food item, although the FA model estimated a slightly lower proportion, potentially due to the low lipid content of krill compared to the fish species used in the model. For the Weddell seal the FA model identified the fish Pleuragramma antarcticum as the most important prey, whereas the SI model was not able to distinguish among prey species, identifying a 'fish-squid' group as the main diet component. For the leopard seal, both models identified krill as the main contributor; however, the predicted proportions for the secondary sources differed. Although vibrissae and outer blubber may not represent the same timeframe, the use of MixSIAR with FA data provides diet estimates comparable to those obtained with SI data, thus, both approaches were complimentary. The use of both biotracers offers a feasible option to study diets of wild animals in a quantitative manner.																	0029-8549	1432-1939															10.1007/s00442-021-05045-z		OCT 2021					WOS:000705695500003	34626270

Multi-scale assessment of distribution and density of procellariiform seabirds within the Northern Antarctic Peninsula marine ecosystem	ICES JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE												The Antarctic Peninsula is one of the most rapidly warming regions on earth, and it is likely that the abundance and distribution of marine predators will change as a result. Procellariiform seabirds are highly mobile predators, which target specific habitat characteristics associated with underlying distributions of prey and areas of increased prey availability. We use ship surveys and hurdle models, to estimate the summer distribution and relative density of 11 seabird species within the northern Antarctic Peninsula marine ecosystem. Models differed among species; however, sea surface temperature and depth were frequently associated with seabird occurrence and had the greatest explanatory power across many species. Null models based on observation data were better at predicting seabird density than models that included environmental covariates. This suggests that the main driver of distribution patterns is the broad-scale habitat features, and fine-scale aggregations within these ranges are harder to predict. Our seabird distribution models reflect known habitat associations, species hotspots, and community organization relative to oceanic and coastal marine processes. Application of species distribution models will benefit the assessments of critical habitat and potential responses to climate change and anthropogenic disturbance, which will provide insight into how species may change in polar ecosystems.																	1054-3139	1095-9289				AUG	2021	78	4					1324	1339		10.1093/icesjms/fsab020							WOS:000692552000013

J	Wright, SW; van den Enden, RL				Wright, SW; van den Enden, RL			Phytoplankton community structure and stocks in the East Antarctic marginal ice zone (BROKE survey, January-March 1996) determined by CHEMTAX analysis of HPLC pigment signatures	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY												The distribution and abundance of phytoplankton communities off east Antarctica were surveyed using CHEMTAX analysis of HPLC pigment profiles, supplemented by microscopy. Eight north-south transects were surveyed between 80 degrees E and 150 degrees E, from approximately 63 degrees S to the sea-ice, during Jan.-Mar. 1996. Spatial resolution of 1-16 km along the shelf break allowed fine-scale resolution of features associated with the ice edge and the Antarctic Slope Front. The maximum concentration of chlorophyll a (Chl a) was 3.4 mu g 1(-1), although most transects had maxima less than or equal to 1.0 mu g 1(-1). Five 'low chlorophyll' transects had average integrated abundances of chi a < 38 mg m(-2), while three 'high chlorophyll' transects had average abundances > 52 mg m(-2). CHEMTAX software was used to estimate the contribution of the different algal classes to total chi a. Eight algal categories were operationally defined by their pigment content: Diatoms, Dinoflagellates, Cryptophytes, Prasinophytes, Chlorophytes, Cyanobacteria, and two categories of haptophytes: Hapto3s (typified by coccolithophorids) and Hapto4s (including Phaeocystis antarctica plus Parmales and other chrysophytes). Regions with melting pack ice typically had an algal bloom that was variable in composition and usually fairly uniform above a deep pycnocline. Significant quantities of detrital matter sank from beneath the melting ice. At each ice edge, there was a local minimum in surface Chi a concentration associated with krill and, in one case, salps. Most algal categories had concentration minima there, but Cryptophytes and often Dinoflagellates and Cyanobacteria had local maxima, perhaps due to selective grazing. North of the ice edge, strong subsurface Chi a maxima were the norm, with concentrations on average 170% of surface values (495% max.) Chlorophyll concentrations were lower in the eastern half of the survey area than the west, although the composition of communities was similar. The composition, concentration and vertical distribution of algal stocks appeared related to the degree of thermal stratification of the mixed layer. Stratified waters had the highest concentrations of Chi a and were associated with high concentrations of Diatoms, whereas well-mixed regions were associated with Hapto4s. Maximum concentrations of most algal groups were principally found on the seasonal pycnocline. However, in stations with well-mixed surface waters, a community dominated by Prasinophytes and Hapto4s was consistently found in the T-min layer whereas other algal groups were found on the pycnocline. Subduction of communities from the T-min layer was apparent at the Antarctic Slope Front. Significant local grazing effects were noted, and it is likely that regional differences in dominant zooplankton may be related to differences in algal stocks. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

J	HUNTLEY, ME; NORDHAUSEN, W				HUNTLEY, ME; NORDHAUSEN, W			AMMONIUM CYCLING BY ANTARCTIC ZOOPLANKTON IN WINTER	MARINE BIOLOGY												Elemental composition and excretion rates of ammonium-nitrogen of zooplankton, ranging over more than five orders of magnitude in body size, were measured in mid-winter in coastal waters west of the Antarctic Peninsula. Excretion rates were constant for the initial 12 h of incubation in the four species tested, and experimental stocking densities of up to 126 mg dry wt l(-1) did not cause variability in the rate of ammonium production. Weight-specific excretion rates of freshly caught Euchaeta antarctica, Conchoecia sp., Thysnnoessa macrura, Euphausin superba, and early stage copepodites of Metridia gerlachei were not significantly different from those reported in summer. However, adult copepods of M. gerlachei and Calanoides acutus appear to have reduced their nitrogen metabolism during winter. Turnover rates of body nitrogen increased with diminishing size, ranging from < 0.5% body N d(-1) for large E. superba to > 7% body N d(-1) for CII and CIII copepodites of M. gerlachei. Only the nitrogen turnover rates of C. acutus were sufficiently low as to suggest that it could survive the entire austral winter without feeding. Phytoplankton and bacterioplankton were virtually absent in both the water column and the sea-ice. We conclude that carnivory is the dominant trophic mode of the pelagic zooplankton community in Antarctica during winter. Production of ammonium-nitrogen by the zooplankton community probably accounts for < 10% of the total ammonium regenerated prior to the annual spring bloom.																	0025-3162					JAN	1995	121	3					457	467		10.1007/BF00349454							WOS:A1995QG40900006

Results show that RO concentrate (1.0 mol L-1 NaCl) got the highest fluoride removal efficiency (93.66% +/- 0.81%) with three stages at 0.01 cm s(-1) flow velocity. Afterwards, fluoride removal experiment with a real krill solution showed 89.34% +/- 0.55% under the optimized conditions. The product has fulfilled the fluoride content of US FDA standard and Canadian Food Inspection Agency in fish and fish products. Results also showed a lower loss of amino acids and proteins in comparison of conventional methods. Finally, a techno-economic evaluation showed that 4.0 USD per ton of Krill solution can be expected by this DD process.

J	Boyd, IL; Murray, AWA				Boyd, IL; Murray, AWA			Monitoring a marine ecosystem using responses of upper trophic level predators	JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY												1. This study examined the changing status of the marine ecosystem at the island of South Georgia (Southern Ocean) using up to 27 variables measured over 22 years from three upper trophic level predators that specialize in foraging upon krill (Eupuasia superba Dana). These variables included population size, breeding performance, offspring growth rate, foraging behaviour and diet. A method was developed for reducing these multivariate time-series to a single vector, called a combined standardized index (CSI). 2. Sensitivity analyses showed that missing values had a large effect upon the accuracy of the CSI but this effect was reduced if the individual variables were highly correlated. The level of correlation and proportion of missing values within the empirical data set were within the acceptable range. Individual variables had widely varying influence upon the CSI but, in general, those with longer time-series had the greatest influence. 3. Principal components analysis showed that variables representing offspring growth tended to explain the greatest proportion of the variability in the CSI and this was followed by variables representing diet. 4. There were 3 years in which the CSI showed extreme and significantly low values. There was a significant non-linear functional response (similar to the Holling Type II functional response) between the overall CSI and krill biomass and a similar relationship existed when the CSI was calculated for each species individually. 5. Separate analysis of variables that were likely to be representative of changing population size showed the presence of a significant decline between 1977 and 1998. There was no trend in the CSI from variables representative of foraging conditions during the summer breeding season. The study has shown that the marine ecosystem at South Georgia shows acute but transient variability that is amplified in the response of upper trophic-level predators. There is less certainty that trends in populations are a consequence of shifts in the degree to which the ecosystem can support krill-feeding seals and penguins.																	0021-8790	1365-2656				SEP	2001	70	5					747	760		10.1046/j.0021-8790.2001.00534.x							WOS:000171128800005

Environmental influences on zooplankton and micronekton distribution in the Bransfield Strait and adjacent waters	POLAR BIOLOGY												The spatial distribution, biomass and size structure of key mesozooplankton species and micronekton in the Bransfield Strait (Antarctica) are described in relation to environmental variables during the austral summer 2001. Stratified (BIONESS) biological sampling at five depth-ranges and CTD casts were performed at 40 stations, including a cross-Strait transect. Six families, 11 genera and 16 species composed the total catch of larval and juvenile fish, which were more abundant in the upper 75 m. Trematomus scotti was the most abundant fish and large individuals dominated at depths > 75 m. The fish distribution patterns were associated with the main water masses in the area and with bottom depth. Spatial segregation in density and biomass of krill (Euphausia superba) and salps (Salpa thompsoni) was observed at a relatively small scale, in relation to the main water masses. Also, size-related spatial segregation was found in krill. The present study suggests that the spatial distribution of krill, salps and early life stages of fish, are influenced by the main water masses in the Strait, and that species may adapt their reproductive strategies not only to seasonal production peaks, but to transport processes within water bodies that maximise their fitness through optimum temperature and/or trophic environments.

J	Tierney, M; Emmerson, L; Hindell, M				Tierney, Megan; Emmerson, Louise; Hindell, Mark			Temporal variation in Adelie penguin diet at Bechervaise Island, east Antarctica and its relationship to reproductive performance	MARINE BIOLOGY												Diet, and in particular, food quality and quantity can influence the reproductive performance of marine predators. Also, the diet of specialist predators is often monitored in programmes that model and manage ecosystems. We examined the diet of Ad,lie penguins (Pygoscelis adeliae), an important consumer of Southern Ocean living resources, at B,chervaise Island, east Antarctica, during the chick-rearing periods for 11 years between 1991-1992 and 2002-2003. We also investigated the relationship between diet and annual reproductive performance. Substantial inter- and intra-annual variation in both meal mass and composition was evident: adults generally returned with larger food loads during the crSche compared with the guard stages, and diet composition was dominated by two prey types, krill and fish, which combined contributed to > 90% of the diet by mass in 7 out of 11 years. Females generally brought back meals dominated by krill; males generally consumed fish-dominated meals. However, both sexes returned with a high proportion of krill when annual mean meal mass was also high, suggesting that more food was available in high krill years. There was also evidence that years of high reproductive performance were positively correlated with years of both high meal and krill mass. We believe that our results indicate that there is significant long-term inter- and intra-annual variability in the amount of food available to Ad,lie penguins and that this was reflected in their diet and measures of reproductive performance. Coupled with the observation that penguins did not switch prey, this indicates that Ad,lie penguins from B,chervaise Island are dependent predators of krill. This contrasts with populations in other locations but supports the notion that Ad,lie penguins are an informative species to monitor the management of Southern Ocean marine living resources in this region.

J	Klein, ES; Watters, GM				Klein, Emily S.; Watters, George M.			What's the catch? Profiling the benefits and costs associated with marine protected areas and displaced fishing in the Scotia Sea	PLOS ONE												Both costs and benefits must be considered when implementing marine protected areas (MPAs), particularly those associated with fishing effort displaced by potential closures. The Southern Ocean offers a case study in understanding such tradeoffs, where MPAs are actively being discussed to achieve a range of protection and sustainable use objectives. Here, we evaluated the possible impacts of two MPA scenarios on the Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) fishery and krill-dependent predators in the Scotia Sea, explicitly addressing the displacement of fishing from closed areas. For both scenarios, we employed a minimally realistic, spatially explicit ecosystem model and considered three alternative redistributions of displaced fishing. We projected both MPAs to provide positive outcomes for many krill-dependent predators, especially when closed areas included at least 50-75% of their foraging distributions. Further, differences between the scenarios suggest ways to improve seal and penguin protection in the Scotia Sea. MPA scenarios also projected increases in total fishery yields, but alongside risks of fishing in areas where relatively low krill densities could cause the fishery to suspend operations. The three alternatives for redistributing displaced fishing had little effect on benefits to predators, but did matter for the fishery, with greater differences in overall catch and risk of fishing in areas of low krill density when displaced fishing was redistributed evenly among the open areas. Collectively, results suggest a well-designed MPA in the Scotia Sea may protect krill-dependent predators, even with displaced fishing, and preclude further spatial management of the krill fishery outside the MPA. More broadly, outcomes denote the importance of delineating fishing and predator habitat, spatial scales, and the critical trade-offs inherent in MPA development.

The trophodynamics of Southern Ocean Electrona (Myctophidae) in the Scotia Sea	POLAR BIOLOGY												The Scotia Sea is one of the most productive regions of the Southern Ocean, but its surface waters are experiencing a rapid increase in temperature, which may be changing the behaviour and distribution of many myctophids and their prey species. Electrona antarctica and Electrona carlsbergi are two of the most abundant myctophids in the region, but their ecology is poorly understood and their response to ongoing environmental change is difficult to determine. This study investigated spatial and temporal patterns in their abundance, population structure and diets using mid-water trawl nets deployed across the Scotia Sea during spring, summer and autumn. E. antarctica was the most numerically abundant species (0.09-0.21 ind. 1,000 m(-3)), with greatest concentrations occurring in the sea-ice sectors. E. carlsbergi occurred in more northern regions, comprising densities of 0.02-0.11 ind. 1,000 m(-3). There was evidence of seasonal variation in depth distribution, size-related sexual dimorphism and size-specific vertical stratification for both species. Latitudinal trends in sex ratio and female body size were apparent for E. antarctica. Its diet varied between regions, seasons and size classes, but overall, Euphausia superba, Metridia spp. and Themisto gaudichaudii were the dominant prey items. E. carlsbergi appeared not to recruit in the Scotia Sea. Its diet was dominated by copepods, particularly Rhincalanus gigas and Metridia spp., but regional, seasonal and ontogenetic variations were evident. This study contributes to our understanding of how mid-water food webs are structured in the Southern Ocean and their sensitivity to ongoing environmental change.

Up to 19 seabird species plus Antarctic fur seals (Arctocephalus gazella) were involved. Black-browed Albatross (Diomedea melanophris), Macaroni Penguins (Eudyptes chrysolophus), and prions (Pachyptila spp.) were the most abundant species. Most flocks were in the vicinity of a large inshore patch of Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba), and most observed feeding was by Black-browed Albatross, which appeared to initiate and dominate the flocks. Short feeding bouts by surface-feeding species appeared to be coupled with the surfacing of penguins and seals. We conclude that foraging penguins and seals caused prey to approach the surface where near-surface foraging species could feed.

In the present work, those compounds were analysed in unhatched penguin eggs and whole krill collected in Admiralty Bay, King George Island, Antarctica in the austral summers of 2004-2005 and 2005-2006. The compounds found in higher levels (in a wet weight basis) were, in most of the egg samples, the PCBs (2.53-78.7 ng g(-1)), DDTs (2.07-38.0 ng g(-1)) and HCB (4.99-39.1 ng g(-1)) and after Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA, the occurrence seemed to be species-specific for the Pygoscelis genus. In all of the cases, the levels found were not higher than the ones in Arctic birds in a similar trophic level. The krill samples analysis allowed estimating the biomagnification factors (which resulted in up to 363 for HCB, one order of magnitude higher than DDTs and chlordanes and two orders of magnitude higher than the other groups) of the compounds found in eggs, whose only source of contamination is the female-offspring transfer.

The largest breeding colonies occur on small offshore islands to the northwest of the main island. To delimit the foraging range of penguins from these colonies during the chick-rearing period, we used a series of ship-based survey transects to estimate their distribution and abundance. The survey transects were positioned so as to radiate from a point close to those islands with the largest colonies. Spatial and temporal variations within the data are examined. Penguins were mostly over the continental shelf in water less than 350 m depth and with more than 70 % of birds at distances less than 40 km from the main breeding site. To model the observed distribution of penguins, a theoretical at-sea distribution is developed together with a 'potential foraging footprint'. The results are compared with those from previous models based solely on the use of foraging trip duration and at-sea activity bud gets. The foraging 'footprint' is probably the best basis currently available for assessing the nature of interactions between macaroni penguins and the commercial fisheries for krill.																	0171-8630						1998	169						263	275		10.3354/meps169263							WOS:000075589000023

They are also key determinants of vertical carbon flux and mediate draw-down of atmospheric CO2 by the ocean. The community composition, abundance and distribution of marine protists (phytoplankton and protozoa) was studied during the Baseline Research on Oceanography. Krill and the Environment-West (BROKE-West) survey, in the seasonal ice zone during the 2005-2006 austral summer between 30 degrees E and 80 degrees E. Light and electron microscopy were used to determine the protistan composition and abundance in samples obtained at 30 sites from surface waters and at 26 sites from the depth of the maximum in situ chlorophyll fluorescence (Chl max). Cluster analysis was used to identify 5 groups of sample sites at the surface and 5 at the Chl max that were of similar protist composition and abundance. The physical characteristics, taxonomic composition, indicator taxa, and taxonomic diversity were determined for each group. In the southwest, a bloom of colonial Phaeocystis antarctica dominated the protistan community composition and biomass amongst the receding ice, but this was replaced by the flagellate life stage/s of this haptophyte in waters to the north. In the southeast, a diatom bloom had the highest diversity of protist taxa observed during the survey and centric diatoms dominated the biomass. Outside these blooms, grazing by krill probably reduced the composition and abundance of large diatoms and autotrophic dinoflagellates in coastal to mid-inshore waters. Only in offshore waters did large diatoms and dinoflagellates increase in abundance and diversity, despite low concentrations of iron and silicate at many of these sites. This increase was probably due to reduced top-down control by krill and other large zooplankton. Large diatoms dominated in offshore waters, despite other coincident studies showing that the trophic structure and function of the microbial community was frequently typical of nanoflagellate-dominated systems in high-nutrient low-chlorophyll waters. Nanoflagellate abundances were low during the survey and were either poorly resolved by our study or limited by microheterotrophic grazing. We propose that protistan abundance and composition in the sea-ice zone of the Indian Sector were determined by synoptic-scale oceanographic features, meso-scale changes caused by sea-ice retreat and meso- to nano-scale interactions between grazers and the composition and abundance of their protistan prey.

Use of SDWBA predictions for acoustic volume backscattering and the Self-Organizing Map to discern frequencies identifying Meganyctiphanes norvegica from mesopelagic fish species	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART I-OCEANOGRAPHIC RESEARCH PAPERS												To acoustically assess the biomass of multiple species or taxa within a survey region, the volume backscatter data should be apportioned to the constituent sound scatterers. Typically, measured back scatter is attributed to certain species using predictions at different frequencies, mostly based on the difference in scattering at the frequencies of 38 and 120 kHz (dual frequency method). We used the full version of the stochastic distortedwave Born approximation (SDWBA) model to predict backscatter spectra for Meganyctiphanes norvegica and to explore the sensitivities of Delta MVBS to the model parameters, e.g. acoustic frequency and incidence angle, and animal density and sound speed contrast, length, and shape. The orientation is almost the unique parameter responsible for variation, with fatness affecting longer lengths. We present a summary of Delta MVBS that can serve as the basis for identification algorithms. Next, we simulate the scenario encountered in the Balearic Sea (western Mediterranean) where Northern krill are mixed with mesopelagic fish species (bristlemouths and lanternfishes), which are modeled with a prolate spheroid model. Simulated numerical data are employed to emulate the discrimination process with the most common identification techniques and typical survey frequencies. The importance of using density-independent techniques for acoustic classification is highlighted. Finally, an unsupervised neural network, the Self-Organizing Map (SOM), is used to cluster these theoretical data and identify the frequencies that provide, in this case, the most classification potential. The simulation results confirm that pairs of frequencies spanning the Rayleigh and geometric scattering regimes of the targets are the most useful for clustering; a minimum of four frequencies are necessary to separate the three species, while three frequencies are able to differentiate krill from mesopelagic fish species.

J	Brierley, AS; Brandon, MA; Watkins, JL				Brierley, AS; Brandon, MA; Watkins, JL			An assessment of the utility of an acoustic Doppler current profiler for biomass estimation	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART I-OCEANOGRAPHIC RESEARCH PAPERS												Acoustic Doppler current profilers (ADCPs) are being used increasingly to derive estimates of zooplankton and micronekton abundance. The absence of a practical means for users to perform ADCP calibration, however, makes the quantitative value of this approach questionable. In an attempt to evaluate ADCP-derived volume backscattering strength (S-c) data, and hence to assess the utility of such measurements for biomass estimation, a regularly calibrated Simrad EK500 scientific echo-sounder (operating at 38, 120 and 200 kHz) and an RDI narrowband ADCP (153.6 kHz) were similarly configured and run in synchrony on a transect in the Southern Ocean. Data were collected by both instruments from congruent depth (4 m) and time (2 min) bins in order to allow direct comparison of numerous discrete values without the need for further signal averaging. Echoes were recorded from the Antarctic krill, Euphausia super ba, in deep-ocean and on-shelf locations during day and night. ADCP-derived volume back scattering strength data from shallow, evenly distributed krill targets were well correlated with equivalent data from the EK500 (r(2) > 0.98), and the offsets between instruments conformed to those predicted for their respective operating frequencies by a theoretical model of sound scattering by krill (H-0: S-upsilon 153.6 kHz = S-upsilon 120 kHz + 2.3 dB, t(0.05(2),155) = 1.98, t = 0.74, P = 0.46). Data from deeper, more irregularly distributed targets differed significantly (P < 0.001). We conclude that under some ideal, but probably rare, circumstances data from the ADCP can be used to derive biomass estimates. The numerous uncertainties surrounding ADCP calibration and the current practical impossibility for users to monitor system performance should, however, preclude these instruments from being used as a matter of course to determine abundance estimates, a task that we believe should remain firmly within the domain of a well calibrated scientific echo sounder.

According to samples of 30,024 articles related to Antarctica, this study reveals the evolution of the scientific outputs on Antarctic research from the aspects of subject categories, major journals, international collaboration, and temporal trends in keywords focus. Antarctic research has developed rapidly in the past two decades, with an increasing amount of article output, references and citations. Geosciences multidisciplinary, oceanography, ecology, meteorology and atmospheric sciences and geography physical were the most popular subject categories. Among the 20 major journals related to Antarctic research, Polar Biology, Geophysical Research Letters and Journal of Geophysical Research-Atmospheres ranked as the top three. With the largest quantity of articles and high citations, USA was the leading contributor to global Antarctic research and had a dominant position in collaborative networks. In addition, a keywords analysis determined that climate change, sea ice and krill were the topics that generated the most interest and concern. Because this paper reveals underlying patterns in scientific outputs, research subjects and academic collaboration, it may serve as a summary of global research history on Antarctica and a potential basis for future research.																	0138-9130	1588-2861				DEC	2014	101	3					1925	1939		10.1007/s11192-014-1332-5							WOS:000345136000018

These were combined with acoustically derived biomass data to calculate the grazing impact of Antarctic krill and its contribution to the carbon flux in the region. Individual levels of gut pigment concentrations and evacuation rates ranged from 27 to 1831 ng chlorophyll a-eq. ind.(-1) and from 0.133 to 0.424 h(-1), respectively. Losses of pigment fluorescence during digestion were very high, ranging from 58 to 98% of the total pigment digested. Daily carbon consumption estimated using the gut fluorescence method varied from 0.234 to 0.931 mg C ind.(-1) day(-1) (or 0.4-1.7% of body carbon), compared to -2.73 mg C ind.(-1) day(-1) (or similar to 5% of body carbon) using the faecal pellet production data. The 3-fold higher daily ration estimated using egestion rate data may be explained by predation on micro- and mesozooplankton. Maximum krill grazing impact ranged from 0.4 to 1.9% of the total phytoplankton stock or from 10 to 59% of the total daily primary production. However, grazing impact on the microphytoplankton (>20 mu m) was substantially higher, at times exceeding 100% of the daily microphytoplankton production. It is suggested that to meet its energetic demands, krill must consume a substantial proportion of heterotrophic carbon.

Have whales returned to a historical hotspot of industrial whaling? The pattern of southern right whale Eubalaena australis recovery at South Georgia	ENDANGERED SPECIES RESEARCH												Around 176 500 whales were killed in the sub-Antarctic waters off South Georgia (South Atlantic) between 1904 and 1965. In recent decades, whales have once again become summer visitors, with the southern right whale (SRW) the most commonly reported species until 2011. Here, we assess the distribution, temporal pattern, health status and likely prey of SRWs in these waters, combining observations from a summertime vessel-based expedition to South Georgia, stable isotope data collected from SRWs and putative prey and sightings reports collated by the South Georgia Museum. The expedition used directional acoustics and visual surveys to localise whales and collected skin biopsies and photo-IDs. During 76 h of visual observation effort over 19 expedition days, SRWs were encountered 15 times (similar to 31 individuals). Photo-IDs, combined with publicly contributed images from commercial vessels, were reconciled and quality-controlled to form a catalogue of 6 fully (i.e. both sides) identified SRWs and 26 SRWs identified by either left or right sides. No photo-ID matches were found with lower-latitude calving grounds, but 3 whales had gull lesions supporting a direct link with Peninsula Valdes, Argentina. The isotopic position of SRWs in the South Georgia food web suggests feeding on a combination of copepod and krill species. Opportunistic reports of SRW sightings and associated group sizes remain steady over time, while humpback whales provide a strong contrast, with increased sighting rates and group sizes seen since 2013. These data suggest a plateau in SRWs and an increasing humpback whale presence in South Georgia waters following the cessation of whaling.

Leopard seal diets in a rapidly warming polar region vary by year, season, sex, and body size	BMC ECOLOGY												Background Resolving the preferred prey items and dietary proportions of leopard seals is central to understanding food-web dynamics in the rapidly-warming Antarctic Peninsula region. Previous studies have identified a wide range of prey items; however, due to anecdotal or otherwise limited information, leopard seal diets remain unresolved by seal sex, individual, body size, region, and season. Over the 2013, 2014, and 2017 field seasons we collected scat, tissue samples (red blood cells and plasma; n = 23) for stable isotope analyses, and previously-reported animal-borne video from 19 adult leopard seals foraging near mesopredator breeding colonies at Cape Shirreff, Livingston Island. We summarized a priori diet information from scat and video analysis and applied a three-isotope (delta C-13, delta N-15, delta S-34), four-source (fish, fur seal, krill, penguin) Bayesian mixing model to examine temporal variability in both prey sources and leopard seal tissues. Results The austral spring diets of males and females focused on Antarctic krill (31.7-38.0%), notothen fish (31.6-36.5%), and penguin (24.4-26.9%) and were consistent across all 3 years. Several lines of evidence suggest the transition to summer foraging was distinct for males and females. Female diets transitioned rapidly to higher delta N-15 values (+2.1 parts per thousand), indicating increased consumption of penguin (29.5-46.2%) and energy-dense Antarctic fur seal pup (21.3-37.6%). Conclusions The seasonal increase in leopard seal delta N-15 values, and thus fur seal in their diet, was predictably related to larger body size; it may also be forcing reductions to the largest Antarctic fur seal colony in the Antarctic Peninsula. Our ensemble sampling approach reduces historical biases in monitoring marine apex predator diets. Further, our results are necessary to best inform regional fisheries management planning.

Hypotheses that increases in populations of krill-eating penguins and seals represent recovery from exploitation, accelerated by removal of krill-eating whales, are being re-evaluated in the light of correlations between population size and reproductive success of seabirds and seals and various features of the biological and physical environment. These correlations involve phocid and otariid seals, penguins and flying birds and sites ranging from the Antarctic continent to sub-Antarctic islands. Although the nature of, and balance between, physical and biological influences differ between sites, regions and different types of predator, processes (including potentially important links with the Southern Oscillation) involving sea-ice extent and distribution play a key role. Major uncertainties over the nature of links between physical and biological processes and the responses of marine populations preclude any confident prediction of the potential effects of future environmental change. However, certain taxa, especially those of specialist ecology, extreme demography and restricted distribution (especially in high latitudes) are especially vulnerable to at least some of the likely environmental changes.																	0962-8436					NOV 30	1992	338	1285					319	328		10.1098/rstb.1992.0152							WOS:A1992KB19800014						
J	Siegel, V				Siegel, V			Distribution and population dynamics of Euphausia superba: summary of recent findings	POLAR BIOLOGY												Antarctic krill, Euphausia superba, has been studied since the early 1920s including distribution, life cycle and behavioural biology. Quantitative aspects of distribution, biomass and demography were becoming more important since the late 1970s when a rapidly developing krill fishery started to exploit this unique resource. Since then, opinions have sometimes changed even on the appraisal of basic features such as small and large scale distribution or dispersion as well as on seasonal and interannual changes in biomass. Finally, the stability and size of the entire population had to be revised, which was believed to be relatively stable in a stable environment. Recent work has shown that the krill stocks are undergoing long-term changes and proximate and ultimate causes are still under discussion. Hence, it seems timely to review the current status of the discussion of sometime diverging interpretation of the results on krill distribution and stock dynamics for various spatial and temporal scales.																	0722-4060	1432-2056				DEC	2005	29	1					1	22		10.1007/s00300-005-0058-5							WOS:000233869100001

These animals use a drag-based propulsion strategy, where pairs of closely spaced swimming limbs are oscillated rhythmically from the tail to head. Each pair is oscillated with a phase delay relative to the neighbouring pair, resulting in a metachronal wave travelling in the direction of animal motion. It remains unclear how oscillations of limbs in the horizontal plane can generate vertical momentum. Using particle image velocimetry measurements on a robotic model, we observed that metachronal paddling with non-zero phase lag created geometries of adjacent paddles that promote the formation of counter-rotating vortices. The interaction of these vortices resulted in generating large-scale angled downward jets. Increasing phase lag resulted in more vertical orientation of the jet, and phase lags in the range used by Antarctic krill produced the most total momentum. Synchronous paddling produced lower total momentum when compared with metachronal paddling. Lowering Reynolds number by an order of magnitude below the range of adult krill (250-1000) showed diminished downward propagation of the jet and lower vertical momentum. Our findings show that metachronal paddling is capable of producing flows that can generate both lift (vertical) and thrust (horizontal) forces needed for fast forward swimming and hovering.

J	Constable, AJ				Constable, AJ			CCAMLR ecosystem monitoring and management: Future work	CCAMLR SCIENCE												Harvesting of marine living resources in the Southern Ocean is managed by the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR). CCAMLR is widely known for its ecosystem approach to managing fisheries with the maintenance of ecological relationships included in the conservation objectives. In the late 1980s, CCAMLR's precautionary approach was developed, incorporating principles of how to use scientific evidence in the decision-making process. Even though this approach was based on the management of a single species (Antarctic krill, Euphausia superba), it takes account of the needs of predators in the assessment of catch limits. The success of this process is due to the formulation of a management procedure which includes decision rules that specify how harvest controls will be adjusted based on the scientific information available and the assessments that arise from such information. To assist the Commission in meeting its objectives, the CCAMLR Ecosystem Monitoring Program (CEMP) was set up to detect the effects of fishing on krill predators. CCAMLR needs to adopt a management procedure which has a good chance of maintaining ecological relationships and meeting the needs of predators, incorporating: (i) operational objectives that articulate the target conditions of relevant aspects of the system, (ii) methods for assessing the status of the system, (iii) decision rules on how to adjust harvest controls given the difference between the assessment and the agreed objectives, and (iv) methods for dealing with uncertainty. This paper reviews progress in developing ecosystem-based management procedures by summarising the gaps in the existing approach, the types of models developed for the Antarctic marine ecosystem, the implications of the large scale of the fishery for designing a monitoring program to detect the effects of fishing, and the types of procedures already proposed for management of the krill fishery. It highlights the need to focus future work in these areas, including the need to evaluate candidate management procedures in advance of the expansion of the krill fishery. Most importantly, operational objectives for dependent species and feasible management options need to be clearly articulated to guide this work.																	1023-4063						2002	9						233	253									WOS:000179438500016

Observations of cetaceans in the south-east Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean, during summer 2008	POLAR BIOLOGY												Knowledge of cetacean species composition and their distribution in the south-east Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean is scarce. During a survey in February-March 2008, systematic whale sightings were carried out along transect lines following the 5 degrees and 15 degrees E meridians between 35 degrees and 67 degrees S. In total, 67 toothed whales and 126 baleen whales were observed. Both fin whales (four animals) and Antarctic minke whales Balaenoptera bonaerenses (three animals) in addition to 16 individuals of unidentified species were among the observed baleen whales. The dominating baleen whale species in our study was humpback whales Megaptera novaeangliae with 108 individuals observed. They occurred single or in groups up to seven individuals (N-mean = 2.5 ind) and eight of the counts were of calves. The relationship between humpback whale occurrence and environmental variables including Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) abundance from acoustic recordings, hydrography, bathymetry and production was tested using general additive models. Only temperature increased the predictive power of the model with whale occurrence increasing with the decreasing temperature in more southern areas.																	0722-4060	1432-2056				JUN	2014	37	6					891	895		10.1007/s00300-014-1477-y							WOS:000338278200012						
J	Brandon, MA; Murphy, EJ; Trathan, PN; Bone, DG				Brandon, MA; Murphy, EJ; Trathan, PN; Bone, DG			Physical oceanographic conditions to the northwest of the sub-Antarctic Island of South Georgia	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS												Ocean physics is a key aspect of the operation of island ecosystems, yet the hydrodynamics is sometimes poorly understood. A high-resolution oceanographic survey to the north of South Georgia identified two water masses. These are South Georgia Shelf Water (SGSW) and Antarctic Zone Water (AZW). At the surface, SGSW is both colder and fresher than AZW; at the near-surface temperature minimum these differences are reversed. There are two causes: SGSW is close to the island and has an additional contribution to the heat and salt balance from increased precipitation and island runoff, and second, AZW has advected from higher latitudes. Both of these mechanisms imply SGSW is retained around the island. Between these water masses is a variable width frontal region that has a mixture of both water masses. In general terms, the mean current of the AZW is to the west. In the SGSW the general flow also appears to be to the west, but at reduced magnitude; there is evidence of a stronger westerly current close to the shore. In both water masses there are easterly surface currents most likely driven by the prevailing wind. An approximation for the limit of SGSW is that it is constrained to water depths <500 m, A significant deviation is caused by an anticyclonic flow around a prominent bank that can be associated with significant, upwelling. Finally, we comment on the ecological significance of the system observed.

Impact of Fatty Acid Supplementation on Cognitive Performance among United States (US) Military Officers: The Ranger Resilience and Improved Performance on Phospholipid-Bound Omega-3's (RRIPP-3) Study	NUTRIENTS												Studies have assessed omega-3 fatty acids and cognitive decline among older adults and cognitive development among children, although less is known about cognitive or neurological effects among young adults. We examined whether omega-3 supplementation from krill oil could improve cognition and resilience among young military officers compared to a control. This double-blind, placebo-controlled trial enrolled 555 officers (mean age 23.4 +/- 2.8, 98.6% male) entering the United States (US) Army Infantry Basic Officer Leaders Course (IBOLC) with the intention to complete the US Ranger Course. Volunteer participants consumed eight dietary supplements daily of krill oil containing 2.3 g omega-3 or control (macadamia nut oil) over an approximate 20-week period. Cognitive functioning, resilience, and mood were assessed during a well-rested period at approximately 14 weeks and after a battlefield simulation at 16 weeks. Blood spot samples were collected to monitor compliance and dietary intake was assessed. All hypotheses were tested using both 'Intention to Treat' (ITT) and 'As Per Protocol' (APP) approaches. Of the 555 randomized individuals, 245 (44.1%) completed the study. No statistically significant group-by-time interactions indicating treatment effect were found on any outcomes. Poor compliance was indicated by lower than expected omega-3 elevations in the treatment group, and may have contributed to a failure to detect a response.

There has been limited direct assessment of these interactions through deployment of cameras on commercial fishing gear especially on demersal longlines. A compact, autonomous deep-sea video system was designed and constructed by the Australian Antarctic Division (MD) for deployment on commercial fishing gear to observe interactions with benthos in the Southern Ocean finfish fisheries (targeting toothfish, Dissostichus spp). The Benthic Impacts Camera System (BICS) is capable of withstanding depths to 2500 m, has been successfully fitted to both longline and demersal trawl fishing gear, and is suitable for routine deployment by non-experts such as fisheries observers or crew. The system is entirely autonomous, robust, compact, easy to operate, and has minimal effect on the performance of the fishing gear it is attached to. To date, the system has successfully captured footage that demonstrates the interactions between demersal fishing gear and the benthos during routine commercial operations. It provides the first footage demonstrating the nature of the interaction between demersal longlines and benthic habitats in the Southern Ocean, as well as showing potential as a tool for rapidly assessing habitat types and presence of mobile biota such as krill (Euphausia superba).

A euphausiid aggregation is represented by a three-dimensional probabilistic vector whose components are the mean ratios of the volume backscattering coefficients, measured at two different frequencies. The decisions on the species and the relative misclassification errors are calculated individually for each component of a vector, using classical Bayesian techniques. Classification probabilities are derived by integrating the individual decisions. The size structure of the classified aggregation is derived from a fluid-sphere model. The effectiveness of the method is demonstrated by comparing the acoustic estimates of species and sizes to net samples collected during three surveys conducted in the Ross Sea under various environmental conditions.

Foraging dynamics of macaroni penguins Eudyptes chrysolophus at South Georgia during brood-guard	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												We used satellite telemetry methods to study macaroni penguins at South Georgia to determine how they ranged from their colonies during the early part of their breeding season at a time when they are constrained to return to their chicks on a near-daily basis. The principal objectives of this study were to examine whether these penguins exploit major oceanographic features where prey may be more predictable, whether birds from one colony forage in separate locations to those from nearby colonies, or whether they range evenly over the available area. Results show that the penguins did not range evenly, that birds from one colony tended to forage in locations separate from those used by birds from nearby colonies (or at least overlap was restricted), and that though birds from some colonies foraged within waters influenced by major oceanographic features such as the southern Antarctic Circumpolar Current front, not all birds in the region focused on such areas, as some birds foraged in other oceanographic contexts. The results from this study highlight the complexity of foraging dynamics for colonially nesting seabirds; they also help inform management models currently being developed for Antarctic krill fisheries, which are a potential competitor for the main prey of macaroni penguins.

In this study, the fatty acyl compositions of free fatty acids (FFA) and triacylglycerol (TAG) in serum, adipose tissue and oxidative muscle were determined in two species of Antarctic fishes, Trematomus newnesi Boulenger, 1902, and Notothenia gibberifrons Lonnberg, 1905, collected off the Antarctic Peninsula in February and March 1987. Total lipid contents of serum and oxidative muscle in each species also were measured. T. newnesi, a mesopelagic species, has significantly more lipid in the serum than N. gibberifrons, a demersal species (17.6 +/- 2.4 and 10.4 +/- 1.0 mg lipid g-1 serum, respectively). The oxidative muscle of T. newnesi also contains more lipid than does that of N. gibberifrons (12.5 and 9.3% by dry weight, respectively). Fatty acids comprising greater than 5% of one or more of the lipid pools assayed in both species include 14:0, 16:0, 16:1, 16:2, 18:0, 18:1, 20:5 and 22:6. The percentages of 16:1 were lower (p < 0.05) in oxidative muscle FFA than in all other assayed lipid pools in both species, suggesting a catabolic preference tor some monoenes in oxidative muscle of these fishes. The percentage of 14:0 was two- to three-fold higher in adipose tissue TAG than in all other lipid pools in both species. Differences in fatty acid compositions between lipid pools indicate than proteins involved in the mobilization, transport or catabolism of fatty acids exhibit differential recognition of fatty acids in T. newnesi and N. gibberifrons.																	0025-3162					MAR	1992	112	3					377	382		10.1007/BF00356282							WOS:A1992HJ52200004

All rights reserved.A biological/oceanographic survey was conducted around the Antarctic Divergence AD) off Adelie Land, Antarctica by the RTV Umitaka-Maru III of Tokyo University of Fisheries in the 1995/1996 Austral summer. Investigations were included (1) characteristics of oceanic structure, (2) primary production and related upper water mass structure, (3) phytoplankton community structure, (4) zooplankton community structure, (5) distribution of Antarctic krill, and (6) optical properties and development of biooptical algorithms for future use of ocean color remote sensing in monitoring phytoplankton biomass. The existence of dense water on the continental slope suggests that the survey area is one of major sources of the Antarctic Bottom Water. We observed a southward meandering of ACC, which allowed the warmer, saline offshore water to intrude south in the eastern part of the area. This east-west gradient in water mass seemed to influence the formation of the local trophic structure in the research area. In the western area, primary productivity was high, and diatoms and copepods dominated, particularly around the AD. The eastern part, however, showed low primary productivity, with a relative dominance of pico- and nanophytoplankton and high abundance of salps. Antarctic krill was distributed mostly in the south of the AD, and its biomass was low compared to previous records, both from adjacent areas and from other Antarctic regions.

It is found from the Subtropical Convergence southward to the coastal Antarctic Seas but being most abundant in the Antarctic Polar Frontal Zone. Low temperatures appear to negatively affect their development, limiting their ability to occur in the krill dominated high Antarctic ecosystems. Yet reports indicate that with ocean warming S. thompsoni have experienced a southward shift in their distribution. As they are efficient filter feeders, this shift can result in large-scale changes in the Southern Ocean ecosystem by increasing competitive or predatory interactions with Antarctic krill. To explore salp bloom dynamics in the Southern Ocean a size-structured S. thompsoni population model was developed with growth, consumption, reproduction and mortality rates dependent on temperature and chlorophyll a conditions. The largest uncertainties in S. thompsoni population ecology are individual and population growth rates, with a recent study identifying the possibility that the life cycle could be much shorter than previously considered. Here we run a suite of hypothesis scenarios under various environmental conditions to determine the most appropriate growth rate. Temperature and chlorophyll a were sufficient drivers to recreate seasonal and interannual dynamics of salp populations at two locations. The most suitable growth model suggests that mean S. thompsoni growth rates are likely to be similar to 1 mm body length d(-1), 2-fold higher than previous calculations. S. thompsoni biomass was dependent on bud release time, with larger biomass years corresponding to bud release occurring during favorable environmental conditions; increasing the survival and growth of blastozooids and resulting in higher embryo release. This model confirms that it is necessary for growth and reproductive rates to be flexible in order for the salp population to adapt to varying environmental conditions and provides a framework that can examine how future salp populations might respond to climate change.

J	Janes, DN				Janes, DN			Osmoregulation by Adelie Penguin chicks on the Antarctic Peninsula	AUK												Physiologists have long contended that consumption of a diet of marine invertebrates imposes a high salt load on animals. I measured water and salt contents in the food, excreta, and body fluids of Adelie Penguin (Pygoscelis adeliae) chicks to determine patterns of osmoregulation in a bird that eats almost exclusively marine invertebrates. Adelie Penguins eat krill (Euphausia spp.) and feed the same to their chicks by regurgitation. Adelie chicks sometimes receive food that is significantly saltier than their body fluids, but on average the food has salt concentrations similar to those in their plasma. Adelie chicks excrete excess solutes via the salt glands, which are fully functional at hatching, and via the kidneys, which produce urine that is more concentrated relative to urine of other bird species, Larger chicks receive food that is drier than that eaten by smaller chicks, and larger chicks may compensate by excreting more of a given salt load via the salt glands, thus conserving water. Regurgitated food has significantly less Na+ than Cl-, but the salt glands secrete equal amounts of these two ions. Consequently, in larger chicks Na+ may be shunted from the urine to be excreted via the salt glands. The loss of this cation in the urine is compensated for by addition of NH4+.																	0004-8038					JUL	1997	114	3					488	495		10.2307/4089249							WOS:A1997XM88600016

In total, 13 species of medusa, 6 species of siphonophore, 3 species of ctenophore and 1 species of salp and nemertean were identified. On average gelatinous organisms contributed 69.3% to the biovolume and 30.3% to the carbon content of the samples, although the ranges were high (0 to 98.9% and 0 to 62.6% respectively). The most important contributor to the biovolume and carbon content was the scyphomedusan Periphylla periphylla. Some specific associations and restricted vertical distributions were related to trophic interactions among ostracods, amphipods and cnidarians. Observations made near South Georgia showed that medusae and ctenophores were preyed upon by albatrosses and notothenioid fish respectively. The results support the premise that gelatinous organisms are a major and, at times, are the main component of the oceanic macroplankton/nekton community in the Southern Ocean.

J	EICKEN, H				EICKEN, H			THE ROLE OF SEA ICE IN STRUCTURING ANTARCTIC ECOSYSTEMS	POLAR BIOLOGY												This paper focusses on the links between growth, persistence and decay of sea ice and the structure of Antarctic marine ecosystems on different spatial and temporal scales. Sea-ice growth may divide an oceanic ecosystem into two dissimilar compartments: (1) the water column, with primary production controlled by the reduction of irradiative fluxes due to the snow-laden sea-ice cover and thermo-haline convection, and (2) the pore space within the ice with incorporated organisms switching from a planktonic to a "kryohaline" mode of life. In the ice, physical boundary conditions are set by (1) the irradiance which is controlled by the optical properties of snow and ice and (2) the ambient temperature which controls salinity and brine volume. Partly due to the high levels of biomass within the sea-ice system, interaction between different groups of organisms concentrates on the planar environment predefined by the ice cover. As a result of regional structuring of ecosystems, four sea-ice regimes may be recognized: seasonal pack ice, coastal zone, perennial pack ice, and marginal ice zone. These regimes are interwoven through the temporal structuring of ecosystems brought about by ice-cover seasonality and ice drift. In comparison with open-water pelagic ecosystems, sea ice appears of particular importance as it partly inverts the ecosystem structure and enhances the degree of ecological variability.

J	CAPELLA, JE; QUETIN, LB; HOFMANN, EE; ROSS, RM				CAPELLA, JE; QUETIN, LB; HOFMANN, EE; ROSS, RM			MODELS OF THE EARLY LIFE-HISTORY OF EUPHAUSIA-SUPERBA .2. LAGRANGIAN CALCULATIONS	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART A-OCEANOGRAPHIC RESEARCH PAPERS												A three-dimensional time-dependent model of the circulation in the Bransfield Strait-South Shetland Islands region and a physiologically-based, temperature-dependent model of the descent-ascent behavior of the embryos and larvae of Euphausia superba were combined in a Lagrangian particle tracing model to simulate trajectories of krill embryos and larvae. The Lagrangian calculations show that: (1) surface flow is the primary factor influencing the final location of the embryo-larva particle: and (2) timing of krill spawning affects the eventual position of the feeding larvae. Seasonal changes in the wind stress field result in variability in direction and velocity of surface currents, which affects the embryo-larva trajectories. Conditions favourable for the transport of larvae to Bransfield Strait occur early in the spawning season. East of the Antarctic Peninsula larvae have a greater probability of entering Bransfield Strait if the krill embryos are released in mid-summer, January to February. Embryos released to the north of the South Shetland Islands. west of 62-degrees-W are transported into Drake Passage. Embryos released to the north of the South Shetland Islands and east of Livingston Island are transported westward where they can eventually enter Bransfield Strait. Krill larvae also are transported into Bransfield Strait from the Bellingshausen and Weddell Seas. The Lagrangian trajectories show that the western Bransfield Strait is a region of potentially high larval concentration due to transport from surrounding areas as well as local production. This is in agreement with observed krill larvae distributions, which show higher concentrations in this region.																	0198-0149					JUL-AUG	1992	39	7-8A					1201	1220		10.1016/0198-0149(92)90064-Z							WOS:A1992JH54000009

Feeding ecology of myctophid fishes in the northern Scotia Sea	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												The diets of 9 species of myctophid fishes, Electrona carlsbergi, E. antarctica, Gymnoscopelus fraseri, G. nicholsi, G. braueri, Protomyctophum bolini, P. choriodon, Krefftichthys anderssoni and Nannobrachium achirus, were investigated during austral autumn in the northern Scotia Sea. Based on the percent index of relative importance (%IRI), the data suggest dietary specialisation in some species, which may permit resource partitioning. Hierarchical agglomerative cluster analysis of Bray-Curtis similarity (60% threshold) separated the myctophid community into distinct feeding guilds. One group (G. braueri and E. antarctica) fed principally on Themisto gaudichaudii, another (P. choriodon and G. fraseri) primarily on copepods (Metridia spp. and Rhincalanus gigas), and a third group (G. nicholsi and F bolini) consumed copepods and euphausids (mostly Metridia spp. and Euphausia frigida). The diets of E. carlsbergi and K anderssoni differed from the other species, with E. carlsbergi being the only species that consumed salps. There was a general switch in diet from copepods to euphausiids and amphipods as the myctophid predator size increased. Dietary specialisation is likely the result of a combination of predator size, gape size, filtering capacity of the gill rakers and the vertical distribution of predators and prey. Antarctic krill were only consumed by the larger myctophids, which represented a numerically minor part of the myctophid community, supporting the concept that myctophids can provide a krill-independent link between secondary production and higher trophic levels. However, the northern Scotia Sea is dominated by adult krill, which are only suitable as prey for larger fish. In the northern Scotia Sea, myctophid predation had a very small impact on copepod production but a higher impact on macrozooplankton, with a best-estimate of 4% of the daily production of Themisto gaudichaudii and 6% of that of Euphausia superba being consumed.				, Martin/ABE-6728-2020; Collins, Martin A/J-8560-2017													0171-8630	1616-1599					2009	386						221	236		10.3354/meps08064							WOS:000268552500018

Five stations were occupied along a 700 km transect southeastwards towards the western tip of South Georgia. Three stations were located north of the Antarctic Polar Front (PF) with mean primary production of 0.41 g C m(-2) d(-1) compared to 0.54 g C m(-2) d(-1) for the stations south of the front. Three stations were in the shelf break and off-shelf region to the east of South Georgia where the lowest rates of primary production were recorded (mean 0.34 g C m(-2) d(-1)). At a further 4 stations northwest of the island, primary production was significantly greater: 0.8 to 2.5 g C m(-2) d(-1) (mean 1.5 g C m(-2) d(-1)). Photoinhibition was a marked feature of the production profiles, resulting in the underestimation of column production by 4 to 16%. An assessment is made of the primary production required to maintain a representative assemblage of metazooplankton around South Georgia composed of 30 g fresh mass (FM) m(-2) krill and 20 g FM m(-2) copepods. The total C requirement of both groups at maximum growth rate is estimated as 0.93 g C m(-2) d(-1), with 0.54 g C m(-2) d(-1) required to maintain basal metabolism (i.e. for zero growth). Local primary production rates are well in excess of the C demands for basal metabolism by the metazooplankton, and likewise the highest regional values exceed those for maximum metazooplankton growth. It is also estimated that the krill biomass required to sustain higher predators during their breeding season could be supported by local production at plausible maximum krill growth rate. In particular, high primary production found in this study to the northwest of South Georgia appears to be adequate to sustain maximum growth rate by krill when their biomass is 30 g FM m(-2), when krill production will exceed predator removal. It is already well known that advection from,higher latitudes is important in supplying energy to the South Georgia system. This study adds to the evidence that locally enhanced primary production is also important in supporting the local food web.																	0171-8630						2002	242						51	62		10.3354/meps242051							WOS:000179463800005						
J	Ritz, DA				Ritz, DA			Is social aggregation in aquatic crustaceans a strategy to conserve energy?	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES					2nd International Symposium on Krill	AUG 23-27, 1999	UNIV CALIF SANTA CRUZ, SANTA CRUZ, CALIFORNIA		UNIV CALIF SANTA CRUZ			Antarctic krill, Euphausia superba, is preeminently a gregarious animal. It lives for almost the whole of its existence from the late furcilia stage in aggregations. Despite this, laboratory study of schooling and swarming behaviour has been seriously neglected and critical emergent properties of group dynamics may have been overlooked. Using different-sized groups of gregarious mysids, I show that weight-specific oxygen uptake is reduced by about seven times when they form cohesive aggregations compared with when they are in uncohesive small groups. If this is true for E. superba. it casts doubt on all previous measurements of metabolic rate and suggests that estimates of the metabolic cost of swimming and perhaps feeding are much too high. The reason that groups conserve energy compared with isolates or small groups is hypothesised to be at least partly due to hydrodynamic processes, which serve to minimise sinking rates. Dye plumes revealed updrafts generated by mysid swarms, which could be exploited by individuals to reduce their sinking rate. These circulation patterns might also increase the efficiency of particle capture by aggregations. I propose that aggregation in aquatic crustaceans is a strategy to optimise energy expenditure and maximise food capture. Measuring behavioural and physiological rate processes in isolated animals will produce only artifacts.																	0706-652X						2000	57			3			59	67		10.1139/cjfas-57-S3-59							WOS:000166531600008

J	Lake, S; Burton, H; van den Hoff, J				Lake, S; Burton, H; van den Hoff, J			Regional, temporal and fine-scale spatial variation in Weddell seal diet at four coastal locations in east Antarctica	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												This description of 905 scats from 4 locations in east Antarctica almost doubles the observations of Weddell seal diet reported to date. Regional, temporal and fine-scale spatial variation in diet was evaluated using both randomisation and parametric statistics. Even within the Vestfold Hills (68degrees33'S, 78degrees15'E) there were several different ecotypes. In the southern fjords the diet was benthic fish and prawns, whereas in the northern area the diet was dominated numerically by Pleuragramma antarcticum-a species of pelagic schooling fish. Along the Mawson coast (68degrees00' S, 63degrees00'E) the diet was spatially homogeneous but varied over time. Squid Psychroteuthis glacialis was an important prey type for a short time in spring, and octopus was also abundant in the Mawson diet. As higher order predators, cephalopods represent another layer of complexity in the food web at Mawson. Both Vestfold Hills and Mawson seemed to be good foraging areas compared with Commonwealth Bay (67degrees00'S, 142degrees30'E) and Larsemann Hills (69degrees24'S, 76degrees13'E), where seals appeared to have eaten less during the summer haul-out period. This investigation described inshore diets using scats from coastal haul-out sites; it also showed that small crustaceae (mysids) were an important prey type, thus revealing the capacity for Weddell seals to join the krill-feeding communities north of the continental shelf. The variety in diet composition demonstrated both flexibility in the Weddell seals' foraging response and the range of different prey species available to Weddell seals over the Antarctic continental shelf and slope. In all but the most southerly area reported to date (McMurdo Sound), the seals take multiple prey species, which may minimise the coupling between Weddell seal population dynamics and the dynamics of their prey.																	0171-8630						2003	254						293	305		10.3354/meps254293							WOS:000183887600025

The 4 yr covered by this study (1991-1992, 1993-1994, 1994-1995, and 1995-1996) were part of the seasonal time series of the Palmer Long-Term Ecological Research program. Chlorophyll a concentrations represented food quantity, and accessory photosynthetic pigments represented phytoplankton community composition or food quality. Instantaneous growth rates reflected the in situ nutritional history of the previous intermolt period. The response of krill to the food environment was seen on temporal scales of days to weeks. Percent growth per intermolt period (percentage growth IMP-1) varied significantly both within and between years, ranging from similar to 2 to 10% IMP-1. Percent growth IMP-1 increased with increasing chlorophyll a (Chl a), reaching a maximum of 9.3% IMP-1 above a critical concentration of about 3.5 mg m(-3). Maximum growth was reached in only 2 yr, 1991-1992 and 1995-1996. In a multiple regression analysis, total Chi a and prymnesiophyte-Chl a explained over 71% of the temporal variance in growth. In general, highest growth was found toward the end of diatom blooms and lowest during periods of low phytoplankton biomass or blooms dominated by cryptophytes and prymnesiophytes. The results of this study support the hypothesis that maximum growth rates are only possible during diatom blooms and that production in Antarctic krill is limited by both food quantity and quality.																	0024-3590					JAN	2000	45	1					31	43		10.4319/lo.2000.45.1.0031							WOS:000084949600004

Surveys were conducted from the RVIB N.B. Palmer in austral fall (April-June) and winter (July-August) of 2001. Acoustic, video, and environmental data were collected along 13 transect lines running across the shelf and perpendicular to the Western Antarctic Peninsula coastline, between 65degreesS and 70degreesS. Depth-stratified net tows conducted at selected locations provided ground-truthing for acoustic observations. In fall, acoustic volume backscattering strength at 120 kHz was greatest. in the southern reaches of the survey area and inside Marguerite Bay, suggestive of high zooplankton and micronekton biomass in these regions. Vertically, highest backscattering was in the 150-450 m depth range, associated with modified Circumpolar Deep Water (CDW). The two deep troughs that intersect the shelf break were characterized by reduced backscattering, similar to levels observed off-shelf and indicative of lower zooplankton biomass in recent intrusions of CDW onto the continental shelf. Estimates of dynamic height suggested that geostrophic circulation likely caused both along- and across-shelf transport of zooplankton. By winter, scattering had decreased by an order of magnitude (10 dB) in the upper 300 m of the water column in most areas, and high backscattering levels were found primarily in a deep (> 300 m) scattering layer present close to the bottom. The seasonal decrease is potentially explained by advection of zooplankton, vertical and horizontal movements, and mortality. Predictions of expected backscattering levels based on net samples suggested that large euphausiids were the dominant source of backscattering only at very particular locations and depths, and that copepods, siphonophores, and pteropods were more important in many locations.

Two species were collected, which differ in colour, size, shape and egg spawning season. They do not resemble any known pelagic species. Their small body diameter of less than 300 mu m allows them to penetrate deeply into the network of brine channels. Their vertical distribution within one ice flee was positively correlated with the accumulation of algal biomass; maxima for both parameters were found in the bottom 5 cm of the flee. The method by which the Turbellaria invade the sea ice is not clear. At present we have no indication that they pass through a pelagic or benthic stage in their life-cycle. As the Turbellaria were found to populate sea ice in areas with water depths ranging from 370 to 4450 m, the presence of benthic phases in their life-cycle, either free-living or epizooic, is not very probable. We suggest that the Turbellaria either use migrating invertebrates as a vector for their propagation or pass through a pelagic stage in their life-cycle.

Crustaceans ranked first by number (98 %) and second by reconstituted mass (37 %). The hyperiid Themisto gaudichaudii and the euphausiid Thysanoessa sp. were the dominant prey items, accounting each for 42 % by number, and for 12 and 4 % by mass of the diet, respectively, Other important crustacean prey were the Antarctic krill Euphausia superba (2% by number and 10% by mass) and the large shrimp Pasiphaea scotiae (<1 and 5 %, respectively). Fish were minor items by number (<1%) but, owing to their large size, they dominated the diet by reconstituted mass (57 %), Mesopelagic fish of the families Myctophidae (14 % by mass) and Melamphaidae (12 %) were the main fish prey together with the gempylid Paradiplospinus gracilis (19 %). Adult blue petrels use a 2-fold foraging strategy, performing short trips (ST, 2 d on average) and long trips (LT, 7 d) during the chick-rearing period, Birds fed more on T gaudichaudii during ST and more on Thysanoessa sp, during LT. The subantarctic krill Euphausia vallentini were found in ST samples, and Antarctic krill and stomach oil were found in LT samples. Biogeography of the prey shows that blue petrels fed in a wide variety of marine habitats, During ST, they foraged in the kelp belt and over the shelf, but favoured oceanic waters in the vicinity of the archipelago. During LT, the occurrence of Antarctic krill indicates feeding in southern Antarctic waters, > 1000 km from the breeding colonies, but blue petrels also foraged on their way back to Iles Kerguelen from these distant foraging grounds to feed their chicks. A comparison of the stable carbon and nitrogen isotopic compositions of chick and adult feathers reveals that adult blue petrels fed at the same trophic level during the chick-rearing and moulting period, and that they renew their flight feathers in Antarctic waters.

State-dependent energy allocation in the pelagic Antarctic silverfish Pleuragramma antarcticum: trade-off between winter reserves and buoyancy	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												Icefishes of the perciform suborder Notothenioidei dominate the Antarctic ichthyofauna. These species originated from a benthic ancestor and do not possess a swimbladder. However, some notothenioids have achieved neutral buoyancy through skeletal reductions as well as storage of lipids to reduce body mass relative to seawater. These adaptations enable them to exploit the highly productive pelagic realm. Mobilizing these lipid reserves in periods of critically low food intake may lead to buoyancy problems. Accumulating and conserving these reserves may slow down the development of somatic and reproductive tissues and hence future reproductive output. We constructed a dynamic state variable model to investigate how ingested energy is partitioned over 3 state variables: lipid reserves, structural protein body mass and egg development. Two forms of the model differed in that lipid reserves were either included in or excluded from the total metabolic energy budget of an individual. The model was parameterised for the Antarctic silverfish Pleuragramma antarcticum, a key species in the pelagic food web of the high Antarctic zone of the Southern Ocean. In Pleuragramma, lipids are stored in unique extracellular lipid sacs, which are thought to serve as buoyancy aids and energy reserves. The model predicts optimal habitat selection and an optimal energy allocation strategy by maximizing future reproductive output. The environment is simulated using vertical gradients in water temperature, optical properties, food availability and predation risk. The form of the model that considers lipids as metabolically inactive reserves best replicates field measurements of fat content and yields high values for fitness in Pleuragramma. Uncoupling fat reserves from metabolism, through the development of extracellular lipid sacs, probably represents a key adaptation in the evolution towards a pelagic lifestyle in a fish species with a low scope for activity.

J	Kang, SH; Lee, SH				Kang, SH; Lee, SH			Antarctic phytoplankton assemblage in the western Bransfield Strait region, February 1993: Composition, biomass, and mesoscale distributions	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												The Bransfield Strait region shows complex patterns of water circulation due to mixing of diverse water masses. Physicochemical properties of the different water types should affect the distribution, biomass, and species composition of the phytoplankton assemblages. We examined these features of phytoplankton in the western Bransfield Strait region during early February 1993. Diversity of the phytoplankton species was low. Only 5 or 6 species accounted for more than 95% of the total phytoplankton carbon biomass. Integrated phytoplankton biomass in the upper 100 m ranged from 407 to 3605 mg C m(-2) (average 1906 mg C m(-2)). Areas with the higher biomass values (2000 to 3500 mg C m(-2)) were located in the northern part of the study area including waters to the north of the South Shetland Islands, and were generally related to increased stability of the surface water originating from the Bellingshausen Sea featuring lower salinity (33.69 to 33.78 parts per thousand) and higher temperature (1.89 to 2.36 degrees C). Distribution of autotrophic nanoflagellates (<20 mu m) showed a marked contrast to that of diatoms. Waters in the Bransfield Strait region were characterized by a dominance of nanoflagellates such as Cryptomonas sp, and Phaeocystis antarctica (motile stage) accounting for 83 % of the total phytoplankton carbon. In the Drake Passage area, however, diatoms such as the nanoplanktonic Fragilariopsis pseudonana and the microplanktonic (>20 pm) Rhizosolenia antennata f. semispina accounted for 84 % of the total phytoplankton carbon. From measurements of upper ocean physical parameters and nutrients in combination with the data on composition, biomass, and distribution of the major phytoplankton species, it was found that mesoscale distributions of phytoplankton species reflect the physical conditions of the upper water column, particularly the profile of vertical stability of the water.																	0171-8630					DEC	1995	129	1-3					253	267		10.3354/meps129253							WOS:A1995TP66400025

Based on the microscopic determination of the relative biomass of the different microalgal taxa we determined three main phytoplankton assemblages that differ in their composition, PP, growth, and spatial and temporal distribution: (1) an assemblage dominated by cryptophytes, with high biomass (59.2 +/- 28.2 mu gC L-1), intermediate PP (63.1 +/- 32 mgC m(-3)d(-1)), and low growth (0.2 +/- 1.1 d(-1)) present in the inner part of the fjord during spring, and related to higher surface water temperatures; (2) an assemblage dominated by microplanktonic diatoms (mainly Odontella weissflogii) with intermediate biomass (40.1 +/- 17.2 mu gC L-1), high PP (151.2 +/- 62.5 mgC m(-3)d(-1)), and high growth (0.9 +/- 1 d(-1)) present from the fjord mouth to the Gerlache Strait waters during spring and in shelf waters during autumn, related to high irradiance and microzooplankton biomass; and (3) an assemblage dominated by dinoflagellates, mainly small gymnodinioids (< 15 mu m long), with low biomass (3.5 +/- 3.5 mu gC L-1), low PP (6.9 +/- 5.1 mgC m(-3)d(-1)), and intermediate growth (0.5 +/- 0.6 d(-1)) present in the whole fjord and the Gerlache Strait during autumn and infrequently during spring, related to high meltwater fraction. During both seasons, the highest phytoplankton biomass, richness and productivity in Andvord Bay was located in a frontal area at the fjord's mouth. Overall, the results of this study support the notion that WAP fjords are highly productive, highlighting the role of microplanktonic diatom as the main organic carbon producers, even when they occur in low abundances, due to their photosynthetic potential and higher Carbon-to-Chlorophyll a ratio. Our results, together with previous phytoplankton growth rates measured in the WAP nearshore waters from King George Island to Marguerite Bay, are higher than those measured on the WAP shelf and in the Ross Sea suggesting micro- and macronutrient enrichment from glacial melt maintains high productivity throughout the growth season in fjords. Our results support the hypothesis that climate change could highly affect the coastal WAP ecosystems by changing the balance between more productive phytoplankton assemblages (diatoms) to considerably less productive phytoplankton assemblages (cryptophytes).

The very productive Coastal and Continental Shelf Zone (CCSZ, 0.9 M km2) can experience severe macronutrient depletion paralleling intense diatom-dominated phytoplankton blooming (maximum >8 mg Chl a m-3) at the ice edge. In the Seasonal Ice Zone (SIZ, 16 M km2), dramatic variations in the hydrological structure occur in surface waters during the spring to summer retreat of the pack-ice, changing from a well-mixed system to a stratified one within the reaches of the ice edge. Grazing activity of euphausiids limits phytoplankton biomass to a moderate level (Chl a maximum around 4 mg m-3). A shift from new production to a regenerated production regime has been demonstrated during spring, along with the key role played by protozoans in controlling high ammonium concentrations (maximum > 2-mu-M) in the surface layers. The well-mixed Permanently Open Ocean Zone (POOZ, 14 M km2) is characterised by variable N/Si ratios in surface waters along a north-south transect: at the northern border of the POOZ (N/Si = 0.25) silicate concentrations as low as < 10-mu-M could help limit the phytoplankton growth. Although favourable conditions have been demonstrated for the initiation of blooms in spring in the Antarctic Circumpolar Current, it appears that critical-depth/mixing-depth relationships control maximum chlorophyll a concentrations < 1-mu-g 1-1 during summer. The POOZ is usually not influenced directly by euphausiids, except for the Scotia Sea and Drake Passage where migrations of krill from the adjacent SIZ are usual. Mesoscale eddies are typical of the Polar Front Zone (FPZ, 3 M km2): significant increases in phytoplankton biomass have been reported in this frontal area (maximum Chl a = 2 mg m-3). Food web and biogeochemical cycles in this sub-system are poorly documented. The question of limitation of the primary production by eolian-transported trace-metals in these different sub-systems is still a matter of debate, although clear iron limitation has been evidenced for offshore waters of the Ross Sea.

J	Reinhardt, K				Reinhardt, K			Food and feeding of Antarctic skua chicks Catharacta antarctica lonnbergi and C-maccormicki	JOURNAL FUR ORNITHOLOGIE												In the austral summers 1993/94 and 1994/95, 54 chicks of C. antarctica lonnbergi, C. maccormicki, as well as mixed pairs of both forms, were ligatured in order to get quantitative results of food composition and consumption. In total, 2992 g food was obtained from Brown Skua chicks, 730 g from South Polar Skua chicks, and 214 g from mixed pair chicks. The food composition varied between the forms. For the two years investigated, there was no diet variation in the South Polar Skua and the mixed pairs. Brown Skua chicks received 80 % penguin components, including digested krill from penguin stomachs, and 12 % station garbage. Three percent were of marine origin. South Polar Skua chicks, in contrast, received 83-87 % fish, 3-13 % crustaceans, including krill, and no garbage. Mixed pair chicks got 73-80 % fish and 17-20 % penguin meat. The amount of food found in the ligatures differed for the three types of samples, being on average 9.5 g per control in the South Polar Skua, 11.9 g in the mixed pairs and 26.0 g in the Brown Skua. The maximum mass obtained in one control bout was 119 g in a Brown Skua chick. The average rates at which food was found in the ligature samples were 2.8 times per day for the South Polar Skua, 3.4 times per day for the Brown Skua and 1.3 times per day for the mixed pairs. There were neither diel differences in the number of feedings nor in the amount of food delivered. With increasing age, the chicks were fed higher amounts of food per feeding, but no correlation between chick age and number of feedings was found. The number of feedings per day, the amount of food per feeding and per day did not differ between twins of eight Brown Skua pairs. For the Brown Skua, no preference of certain internal organs of the penguin body as a food source was found.																	0021-8375					APR	1997	138	2					199	213		10.1007/BF01651623							WOS:A1997WX30000004

Yet, the changing cryosphere impacts society within Antarctica as well, and this article expands the focus of Antarctic ice research to include human activities on and around the continent. It reframes Antarctica as a place with human history and local activities that are being affected by melting ice, even if the consequences are much smaller in scale than the effects of global sea level rise. Specifically focused on tourism and conservation along the west Antarctica Peninsula (wAP), this article demonstrates the impacts of changing glaciers and sea ice on the timing, location, and type of tourism as well as the ability of changing ice to mediate human experiences through conservation agendas. As future ice conditions influence Antarctic tourism and conservation, an attention to issues emerging within the wAP region offers a new perspective on climate change impacts and the management of Antarctic activities in the 21st-century Anthropocene.

J	Boyd, IL				Boyd, IL			Temporal scales of foraging in a marine predator	ECOLOGY												The pattern of prey distribution can profoundly affect the foraging behavior and success of a predator. In pelagic marine ecosystems, where prey is often patchily distributed, predators must be able to adapt quickly to changes in the spatial patterning of prey. Antarctic fur seals feed primarily on krill, which is patchily distributed. When combined with information about swimming speed on the surface, the time taken for a fur seal to locate a new patch after leaving an old one is an indication of the distance between patches. The frequency distribution of intervals between bouts of foraging showed that fur seals foraged at two spatial distributions: (1) a fine-scale (median distance 0.18-0.27 km) represented by short (<5 min) travel durations between patches; and (2) a coarser or mesoscale (median distance 1.3-1.6 km) represented by longer (>5 min) travel durations. In a study lasting 5 yr, the distributions of travel durations between bouts of feeding changed between years. These changes suggested that the structure and/or the spatial distribution of krill swarms varied between years. The behavior of fur seals suggested that there was overall clumping of prey at the fine-scale, but there was a more even spacing of prey patches at the meso-scale level. Only in 1 yr of the study (1990/1991) were there indications that fur seals had difficulty in finding enough food. Fur seal behavior suggested that there was no reduction in the number of prey patches available in that year but that prey patches were of poorer quality. The study showed how predator behavior can provide valuable information about the functional relationship between prey dispersion and predator performance.																	0012-9658	1939-9170				MAR	1996	77	2					426	434		10.2307/2265619							WOS:A1996TY19800007

Foraging distribution and competition for prey between Adelie and chinstrap penguins	MARINE BIOLOGY												Adelie (Pygoscelis adeliae) and chinstrap penguins (P. antarctica) are morphologically and ecologically very similar, have very similar diet and breed sympatrically in the Scotia Arc from the South Sandwich Islands to the Antarctic Peninsula. To investigate how these two species co-exist, their foraging distribution and diet were studied during the chick-rearing period at Signy Island, South Orkney Islands, during the breeding seasons of 2000 and 2001. Satellite tracking data from of 19 Adelie penguins and 24 chinstrap penguins were used to compare foraging distributions. In both years the diet of both species was exclusively Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) of the same size range. In a year of low prey availability (2000), there was a statistically significant segregation of foraging areas between the two species, however, in a year of normal resource availability (2001) there was no such segregation. There was a significant difference in the foraging areas used by Adelie penguins between years but not for chinstrap penguins. Adelie penguins foraged significantly farther (mean 100 km) from the colony than chinstrap penguins (mean 58 km) in 2000 but not in 2001 (mean 58 km and 35 km respectively). In 2000, the breeding success of Adelie penguins was 51% lower than the long-term mean compared to 15% lower in chinstrap penguins. Both species achieved above average breeding success in 2001. The changes in foraging distribution and breeding success suggest that in years of low resource availability, chinstrap penguins may be able to competitively exclude Adelie penguins from potential inshore foraging areas. Current trends in climatic change and possible effects on ice distribution and krill abundance suggest that conditions could become less favourable for Adelie penguins than chinstrap penguins in areas where both species occur.																	0025-3162					DEC	2002	141	6					1165	1174		10.1007/s00227-002-0899-1							WOS:000180044300018

Z.; Montone, Rosalinda C.; Bustamante, Paco			Mercury in the ecosystem of Admiralty Bay, King George Island, Antarctica: Occurrence and trophic distribution	MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN												Mercury (Hg) can reach the environment through natural and human-related sources, threatening ecosystems all over the planet due to its well known deleterious effects. Therefore, Antarctic trophic webs, despite being relatively isolated, are not exempt of its influence. To evaluate Hg concentrations in an Antarctic ecosystem, different tissues from 2 species of invertebrates, 2 of fish, 8 of birds, 4 of pinnipeds and at least 5 of vegetation were investigated (n = 176). For animals, values ranged from 0.018 to 48.7 mu g g(-1) dw (whole Antarctic krill and Antarctic Fur Seal liver). They were generally correlated to trophic position (assessed by delta N-15 and delta C-13) but also to cephalopods and myctophids consumption. For vegetation, values ranged from 0.014 to 0.227 mu g g(-1) dw (Colobanthus quitensis and an unidentified lichen), with lichens presenting significantly higher values than mosses, likely due to year-round exposure and absorption of animal derived organic matter, as hypothesized by literature.

Primary production throughout austral fall, during a time of decreasing daylength in the western Antarctic Peninsula	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												Antarctic phytoplankton is characterized by a pronounced seasonality in abundance, driven mainly by changes in sunlight. We combined measurements and modeling to describe the influence of changing daylength on fall and winter phytoplankton production in coastal waters of the western Antarctic Peninsula (wAP) in 2001 and 2002. The model was parameterized with field observations from the Palmer Long-Term Ecological program in the wAP during summer and early fall and from the Southern Ocean Global Ecosystems Dynamics program fall and winter cruises to Marguerite Bay and shelf waters. Shorter daylength and a deepening of the mixed layer account for most of the decrease in primary production during March, April, and May. At this time, biomass decreases by an order of magnitude and remains low and constant until the end of August. An additional loss rate was added to the primary production model to fit output to observations. This loss rate, estimated at similar to 0.1 to 0.15 d(-1), is due to physical, chemical, and biological processes such as scavenging by sea ice, zooplankton grazing, cell lysis, and cell sedimentation, which are expected to be high at this time of year. Growth and loss rates of phytoplankton populations are similar on 1 March, with growth decreasing rapidly over time while the loss rates remain constant. By the beginning of winter (1 June), growth is low, with minimum rates in July and increasing towards September. During a period of diminishing food supply, preliminary estimates of grazing indicate that fall biomass could support existing macrozooplankton populations, but the timing and concentration of food supply is variable and expected to affect health of zooplankton as they enter the winter.

J	Stubing, D; Hagen, W				Stubing, D; Hagen, W			Fatty acid biomarker ratios - suitable trophic indicators in Antarctic euphausiids?	POLAR BIOLOGY												Fatty-acid biomarkers are frequently used for the identification of trophic relationships among marine zooplankton. We have evaluated the suitability of five fatty-acid ratios [16:0/16:1(n-7), 16:1(n-7)/18:4(n-3), 18:1(n-9)/18:1(n-7), 20:5(n-3)/22:6(n-3), PUFA/SFA] that have been proposed as trophic indicators in the literature. Total lipid content and fatty-acid composition were determined in four Antarctic euphausiid species (Euphausia superba, E. frigida, E. triacantha, Thysanoessa macrura). There is a significant relationship between the lipid content and most of these ratios in the investigated euphausiids. Only the 16:1(n-7)/18:4(n-3) ratio exhibits no clear relationship to total lipids. Further exceptions occur in E. triacantha: the 18:1(n-9)/18:1(n-7) and the 20:5(n-3)/22:6(n-3) ratios are not correlated to the lipid content in this species. There is a weaker correlation between the fatty-acid ratios and the total lipid content in E. superba larvae than in the postlarvae, indicating a stronger dietary influence on the lipids of the younger stages. We conclude that those fatty-acid ratios that strongly depend on an animal's total lipid content (particularly PUFA/SFA), are only of limited use as trophic indices, since total lipid content may vary greatly with factors (such as reproductive processes) that are unrelated to specific feeding preferences.

Interannual to diurnal variability in the near-surface scattering layer in Drake Passage	ICES JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE												Backscattering strength was estimated from 127 shipboard surveys with an acoustic Doppler current profiler (ADCP) made during Drake Passage transits from 1999 to 2004. The backscattering strength is used to determine the characteristics of the near-surface scattering layer, which south of the Southern Antarctic Circumpolar Current Front (SACCF) is dominated by Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba). Diel vertical migration in the upper 150 m was the dominant variability observed in any single transect. When averaged over depth, there was a well-defined annual cycle in backscattering strength, with a factor of four increase from a late-winter minimum to a spring-summer maximum over a period of four months, followed by a more gentle decline during late summer and autumn. in addition, there were significant differences in scattering strength north and south of the Polar Front (PF) on both seasonal and interannnual time-scales. The average summer maximum to the north of the PF was more than twice the maximum to the south, but the winter minima were about the same. On interannual time-scales, scattering strength south of the PF displayed a negative linear trend primarily attributable to a fourfold decrease in backscattering strength south of the SACCF. No significant long-term trend in the scattering strength north of the SACCF was observed.																	1054-3139	1095-9289				DEC	2007	64	9					1617	1626		10.1093/icesjms/fsm138							WOS:000252019300001

A variety of schemes have been used to partition the Southern Ocean, based variously on frontal positions, sea ice, productivity, water depth and nutrient concentrations. We have tested the utility and robustness of ecosystem bioregionalisation for the Scotia Sea, by classifying spring, summer and autumn stations on the basis of nutrient concentrations, phytoplankton taxa, meso- and macrozooplankton, fish catches and acoustic data. Despite sampling across different seasons and years, at different spatial scales and taxonomic resolutions, cluster analysis indicated basically consistent spatial divisions across this wide range of trophic levels. Stations could be classified into two main groups, lying broadly to the north and south of the Southern Antarctic Circumpolar Current Front (SACCF). In some aspects the 2 station groups were similar, with both having variable but often high phytoplankton biomass as well as similar biomass of fish. However, the colder water southern group, most of which was covered by seasonal sea ice, had a fundamentally different food web structure to that in the northern Scotia Sea. The cold water community had a depleted, cold-adapted fauna characterised by low zooplankton biomass, Euphausia superba and the fish Electrona antarctica and Gymnoscopelus braueri. In contrast the northern group was richer with higher mesozooplankton biomass and a fauna of warmer or more cosmopolitan species such as Thernisto gaudichaudii, Euphausia triacantha and the fish Protomyctophum bolini, Kreffticthys anderssoni and Gymnoscopelus fraseri. The position of the food web transition, broadly consistent with the position of the SACCF, supports a recent circumpolar-scale bioregionalisation. However, there is little evidence that this relatively weak frontal transition represents a significant barrier either here or elsewhere in the Southern Ocean. We suggest that broader-scale factors, namely temperature and possibly the extent of the seasonal ice-zone, within which most of the southern stations lay, were more likely to influence biological zonation.

Fine-scale habitat selection of crabeater seals as determined by diving behavior	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY												Previous studies within the Marguerite Bay region of the Antarctic Peninsula (similar to 67 degrees S, similar to 67 degrees W) demonstrated that during winter, crabeater seals (Lobodon carcinophagus) were not randomly distributed across available habitat, but instead were more likely to be located in nearshore waters where bathymetric gradients and ice concentrations were high. Here, we investigate how the diving patterns of crabeater seals vary in response to these habitat characteristies, and interpret seal behaviors in light of information on the distribution of their primary prey, krill (Euphausia superba or Euphausia crystallorophias). Diving and movement patterns were obtained from 34 seals (16 male, 18 female) fitted with satellite-relayed data loggers (SRDLs) during the 2001 and 2002 Southern Ocean GLOBEC cruises. Tags transmitted position and dive information for 4-174 days, during which time we received an average of 21 positions/day, and information on a total of 124,681 dives. A series of generalized linear mixed-effect models (GLMM) were used to evaluate the relationship between diving behavior and temporal and physical features of the habitat, and models contrasted using AIC(c) and BIC weights. Overall, we found that the most parsimonious models included year, month, and period (day, dusk, night). In general, seals dived deeper (158 vs. 73 m) and longer (432 vs. 360 s) during the day than at night. In addition, daytime dives included slightly more time at the foraging depths (142 vs. 102 s), and were slightly more efficient (24% vs. 21% of the dive cycle spent at the bottom). When dive patterns were examined with respect to bathymetry, models indicated that seals were foraging in shallower waters (366 vs. 410m) and closer to the bottom (dives were 50.3% vs. 26.3% of bathymetric depth) during the day than at night. In combination, these findings suggest that crabeater seals foraging during the day exploited zooplankton schools compressed along the bottom. At night, when zooplankton were dispersed and light levels low, foraging activity was less frequent and seals concentrated their diving closer to the surface over a broader range of habitat depths. As individual seals moved an average of only 4.1 +/- 1.4 km between daytime and nighttime positions, these results suggest that crabeater seals diving along the Western Antarctic Peninsula select areas of high bathymetric gradients so that they can maximize foraging success over a 24-h cycle without the need to travel long distances. However, annual differences in behavior and the generally low amount of deviation explained by models also suggests that seals vary their diving behavior in response to finer-scale biological, temporal, and/or physical features that were not monitored as part of this study.

The dominant nanoflagellates in the WAP are cryptomonad algae. Using a twenty-year time series collected by the Palmer Long Term Ecological Research program at the United States Palmer Research Station, we assessed long-term patterns and stability in the coastal phytoplankton communities in the WAP. There was significant interannual variability in the integrated water column chlorophyll a (chl-a) concentrations, which varied by a factor of 5 over the 20-year time series. There has been a significant positive increase in the seasonally integrated concentration of chl-a over the time series. The dominant phytoplankton were diatoms, with cryptophytes the second most abundant. Mixed flagellates also constituted a significant fraction of the chl-a but showed less interannual variability than diatoms and cryophytes. Peak phytoplankton biomass was observed in summer months, when monthly averaged wind speed was lower than in the fall and autumn. Cryptophytes were most abundant during the summer months (December-January) after the seasonal retreat of sea ice. While diatoms were observed over the full range of observed salinities 32-34.5) as well as over the full range of in situ temperatures (-1.5 to -2.5 degrees C), the cryptophyte populations were observed in locations with lower salinity 32.5-33.75) and colder water (-1 to 1 degrees C). Environmental factors that favored a shallower seasonal mixed layer resulted in larger diatom blooms compared to the other phytoplankton taxa. During summer with lower phytoplankton biomass, a larger proportion of the chlorophyll a was associated with cryptophytes. These results demonstrate that continued temperature changes along the West Antarctic Peninsula will result in changes in phytoplankton concentration and community composition, which has significant ramifications for the food web.				schofield, oscar/H-4169-2018; Carvalho, Filipa/B-7223-2017; Finkel, Zoe/B-9626-2008; Miles, Travis/L-7918-2013	schofield, oscar/0000-0003-2359-4131; Carvalho, Filipa/0000-0002-8355-4329; Finkel, Zoe/0000-0003-4212-3917; Waite, Nicole/0000-0002-1107-4959; Irwin, Andrew/0000-0001-7784-2319; Miles, Travis/0000-0003-1992-0248; Coleman, Kaycee/0000-0002-6935-2923												0967-0637	1879-0119				JUN	2017	124						42	54		10.1016/j.dsr.2017.04.014							WOS:000404700200004

Although growth and mass at weaning were highly correlated, they were not related to maternal characteristics in 1988 or 1989. However, in 1990 there was a negative relationship between growth of pups and mean duration of foraging trips. Growth rates of males and females varied considerably between 1972 and 1991 and appeared to decline from 1984 through 1990. Methods used to collect and weigh the pups influenced the nature and magnitude of sex differences in estimated growth rates. Growth rates of male and female pups did not differ when weighed serially (same individuals weighed throughout lactation), but males grew faster than females when weighed cross-sectionally (different individuals weighed throughout lactation). Based on our results of pairs of mothers and pups followed over the lactation period, maternal investment was greater in males than females because males were heavier at birth and older at weaning than females and not because of any differential growth between the sexes. Mothers appear to have to work longer, but not harder, to wean males than females. Under the favorable feeding conditions that usually exist, individual differences in the growth of pups are most likely influenced by variation in foraging efficiency of mothers.																	0022-2372					NOV	1993	74	4					908	919		10.2307/1382429							WOS:A1993MK17100011

During foraging trips to sea, chinstrap penguins made shallow, short duration dives almost continuously, for the most part within 50 m of the surface. Diving effort was concentrated during the daylight hours (10h00-15h00), although a second peak in effort was seen around midnight (22h00-02h00). These peaks were possibly due to the constraints of visual location of prey, chick provisioning, or the need to take advantage of diurnal changes in krill swarm densities or behaviour. It was estimated that most effort was concentrated 3-20 km from shore. Dive depth and duration averaged 31.0 m (+/- 26.3 m) and 72 s (+/- 36 s), respectively. Maximum dive depth and duration were 121 m and 180 s, respectively.																	0954-1020					MAR	1993	5	1					9	15		10.1017/S0954102093000033							WOS:A1993KQ24500003

Euphausia superba and Euphausia crystallorophias, which are dominant Antarctic krill, are major prey for most predators, such as fishes, birds, and marine mammals. An understanding of the feeding ecology of krill may provide the information for the structure and function of the Amundsen Sea ecosystem. Thus, we applied two biochemical approaches (fatty acids and stable isotopes) to determine the trophodynamics of adult krill in the Amundsen Sea. There were no significant differences in lipid contents between the two species, but the dominant storage lipids were different. Triacylglycerol (TAG) was dominant in E. superba, but wax esters (WE) were dominant in E. crystallorophias due to their different living strategies. Furthermore, the lipid content of E. crystallorophias displayed a spatial variation, being highest on the glacial edge. It was difficult to understand the feeding strategy and food source using only the fatty acid compositions of krill and in situ particulate organic matter. However, we found that specific FA ratios (18:1 omega 9/18:1 omega 7 and PUFA/SFA) and the nitrogen isotope ratio (delta N-15) provide more insight into the feeding ecology of krill, such as feeding strategy and trophic position. These ratios suggest that E. crystallorophias consistently showed a higher degree of carnivorous feeding than E. superba in the Amundsen Sea during the austral summer. In conclusion, adult E. superba might more directly obtain their energy from in situ primary producers in the open sea, but, in the Amundsen Sea Polynya, adult E. crystallorophias seems to obtain their energy mainly through the microbial loop (microzooplankton). If so, E. crystallolophias would be a key player not only to transfer the energy from microbes to higher trophic levels but also to control the carbon and nitrogen cycle in the Amundsen Sea Polynya.

Total body oxygen stores were estimated from measures of hematocrit, hemoglobin, myoglobin, and total blood volume and were used to calculate an aerobic dive limit (ADL). Movement patterns and diving behavior were measured by equipping the seal with a Satellite Relay Data Logger that transmitted data from 8-31 August 2002. The seal remained in a focal area, in contrast to crabeater seals tracked simultaneously. The seal displayed short, shallow dives (mean 2.0 +/- 1.4 min, 44 +/- 48 m) and spent 99.9% of its time within the estimated ADL of 7.4 min. The shallow diving behavior contradicts previous diet research suggesting Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) is the primary prey of leopard seals during the winter months as krill were found at deeper depths during this period. These measurements of diving and movement of a leopard seal provide valuable preliminary data necessary to develop future research on the at-sea behavior of an apex predator in the Antarctic ecosystem.

Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) dominated the diet of Adelie and gentoo penguins in all three studied stages (pre-breeding, breeding and post-breeding). Nevertheless, only in gentoo penguins a shift in the diet was evident from mainly krill during the breeding stage to mixed diet (i.e. krill and fish/squids) during the pre-and post-breeding stages. Results from stable isotopes suggest that Adelie penguins might be foraging in southern localities compared to their congener during the inter-breeding period. Moreover, Adelie penguins showed a large individual variability in foraging habitat during the post-breeding stage. However, our model has predicted that both species exploited similar areas during the breeding season. The results obtained during the chick-rearing stage were compared with the stomach contents of both species obtained during the same season (2011/2012). Our findings provide new knowledge on the feeding ecology and foraging habitats of pygoscelid penguins. They confirm the importance of Antarctic krill during the annual cycle and improve the understanding of life strategies and predator-prey interactions essentially out of the reproductive period, in which the information is very limited. These results can help to establish new management strategies, particularly considering the potential overlap between predators and fisheries.

J	Pond, DW; Tarling, GA; Schmidt, K; Everson, I				Pond, David W.; Tarling, Geraint A.; Schmidt, Katrin; Everson, Inigo			Diet and growth rates of Meganyctiphanes norvegica in autumn	MARINE BIOLOGY RESEARCH												Fatty acid biomarkers analysis was performed on juvenile and adult northern krill (Meganyctiphanes norvegica) to determine variability in diet between individuals and the consequences for their growth rates. Animals were sampled from Gullmarsfjorden, western Sweden during September 2004 and incubated for 4 days to measure instantaneous growth rate (IGR) before subsequent fatty acid analysis. We found positive linear relationships between IGR and certain fatty acid concentrations within adult specimens. In particular, highest growth was seen in individuals containing high concentrations of 18:2(n-6) and 18:3(n-6), indicative of filamentous algae and/or terrestrial carbon dietary sources, and 16:4(n-1), a biomarker fatty acid for diatoms. Similar relationships were not evident for juvenile krill. In an accompanying study, stomach content analyses established that adult krill had been feeding on a diverse range of red, brown and green benthic filamentous algae, which contain fatty acids of the (n-6) series. Incidence of filamentous algae in the stomachs of juvenile krill was much lower, possibly reflecting the shallower water depths inhabited by this maturity stage. Although a benthic feeding mode has previously been observed for M. norvegica, this is the first direct evidence to indicate that benthic food sources can be important in supporting the growth of this euphausiid. Furthermore, high variability in growth rates and fatty acid concentrations between individuals suggest a diversity of feeding strategies within this fjordic population.																	1745-1000	1745-1019					2012	8	7					615	623		10.1080/17451000.2011.653366							WOS:000304592600005

Adelie Penguin at Cape Hallett fed on Antarctic krill and Adelie Penguin at Inexpressible Island fed on ice krill and Antarctic silverfish. Emperor Penguins fed on Antarctic silverfish regardless breeding site. Therefore, Adelie Penguin showed regional difference in the diet and Emperor Penguin showed no regional differences in the diet. These diet composition of penguins is affected by competition and distribution of prey, it is important to study the diet of penguins in relation to the sympathetic food sources needed to understand the changes in energy flows and Ross Sea ecosystems due to climate change. To identify the dietary composition and characteristics of both Adelie (Pygoscelis adeliae) and Emperor (Aptenodytes forsteri) penguins at four breeding sites, we performed stable carbon (delta C-13) and nitrogen (delta N-15) isotope analysis of down samples taken from penguin chicks. Adelie Penguin chicks at Cape Hallett mostly fed on Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba; 65.5 +/- 3.5%), a reflection of the prevalence of that species near Cape Hallett, and no significant differences were noted between 2017 and 2018. However, Adelie Penguin chicks at Inexpressible Island, located near Terra Nova Bay, fed on both Antarctic silverfish (Pleuragramma antarctica; 42.5%) and ice krill (Euphausia crystallorophias; 47%), reflecting the high biomass observed in Terra Nova Bay. Meanwhile, no significant difference was noted between the two breeding sites of the Emperor Penguin. Emperor Penguin chicks predominantly fed on Antarctic silverfish (74.5 +/- 2.1%) at both breeding sites (Cape Washington and Coulman Island), suggesting that diet preference represents the main factor influencing Emperor Penguin foraging. In contrast, the diet of the Adelie Penguin reflects presumed regional differences in prey prevalence, as inferred from available survey data.

Firstly, a sufficient condition for the global asymptotical stability of the positive equilibrium is given using Poincare-Bendixson theorem excluding periodic solution. Furthermore, we discuss the existence of Hopf-bifurcation and give criteria for stability switches through the study of a first-order exponential polynomial characteristic equation.

J	Brierley, AS; Ward, P; Watkins, JL; Goss, C				Brierley, AS; Ward, P; Watkins, JL; Goss, C			Acoustic discrimination of Southern Ocean zooplankton	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY												Acoustic surveys in the vicinity of the sub-Antarctic island of South Georgia during a period of exceptionally calm weather revealed the existence of a number of horizontally extensive yet vertically discrete scattering layers in the upper 250 m of the water column. These layers were fished with a Longhurst-Hardy plankton recorder (LHPR) and a multiple-opening 8 m(2) rectangular mid-water trawl (RMT8). Analysis of catches suggested that each scattering layer was composed predominantly of a single species (biovolume > 95%) of either the euphausiids Euphausia frigida or Thysanoessa macrura, the hyperiid amphipod Themisto gaudichaudii, or the eucalaniid copepod Rhincalanus gigas. Instrumentation on the nets allowed their trajectories to be reconstructed precisely, and thus catch data to be related directly to the corresponding acoustic signals. Discriminant function analysis of differences between mean volume backscattering strength at 38, 120 and 200 kHz separated echoes originating from each of the dominant scattering layers, and other signals identified as originating from Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba), with an overall correct classification rate of 77%. Using echo intensity data alone, gathered using hardware commonly employed for fishery acoustics, it is therefore possible to discriminate in situ between several zooplanktonic taxa, taxa which in some instances exhibit similar gross morphological characteristics and have overlapping length-frequency distributions. Acoustic signals from the mysid Antarctomysis maxima could also be discriminated once information on target distribution was considered, highlighting the value of incorporating multiple descriptors of echo characteristics into signal identification procedures. The ability to discriminate acoustically between zooplankton taxa could be applied to provide improved acoustic estimates of species abundance, and to enhance field studies of zooplankton ecology, distribution and species interactions.

Abundance estimation of Ad,lie penguins at the Esperanza/Hope Bay mega colony	POLAR BIOLOGY												The Ad,lie penguin (Pygoscelis adeliae) breeding population at Esperanza/Hope Bay, at the tip of the Antarctic Peninsula, is one of the largest Ad,lie penguin colonies in Antarctica. Nevertheless, the last known published field count during the egg-laying period is from 1985/1986. We counted breeding pairs within the entire colony, consisting of 274 breeding groups, during the 2012/2013 breeding season for comparison with previously published ground and satellite-derived counts. We also counted breeding pairs in 26 breeding groups that have been monitored annually since 1995/1996. We estimated the current population size to be 104,139 (95th-percentile CI 70,126-138,151) breeding pairs for the whole colony. The counts indicate population declines of 15.9% over 27 years in the whole colony and 37.5% over 18 years in the annually monitored subset of breeding groups, respectively. The observed decrease matches recent trends reported in other Ad,lie penguin colonies throughout the western Antarctic Peninsula and southern Scotia Sea. This population assessment contributes to the current estimates of the total predator populations in the region, which is necessary information for the management of marine living resources.				, Jefferson/AAG-1702-2021	, Jefferson/0000-0002-3600-1414; Silvestro, Anahi Mariel/0000-0002-8134-9815; Juares, Mariana A./0000-0002-6763-0416												0722-4060	1432-2056				NOV	2018	41	11					2337	2342		10.1007/s00300-018-2373-7							WOS:000446075800015

Population decline of chinstrap penguins (Pygoscelis antarctica) on Deception Island, South Shetlands, Antarctica	POLAR BIOLOGY												Population changes of top predators can provide key indications of environmental quality. In the Antarctic ecosystem, population dynamics of top predators like penguins may yield important information about how the environment is changing. From 1991-1992 to 2008-2009 censuses of the chinstrap penguin (Pygoscelis antarctica), breeding population of Vapour Col in Deception Island (South Shetlands Islands) were carried out. Censuses were conducted on 19 sub-colonies, mainly in December around the time of peak hatching. Nest counts were taken from photographs that were recorded from a standard location. Some censuses were also made in mid-January in 1999, 2006, 2007 and 2008. Our results reveal that the population has declined by 36 % when comparing data from 1991 with those from 2008. The strongest decline occurred since 2000. No temporal trends were detected in reproductive success. Declines of Chinstrap penguin populations constitute a general pattern in the South Shetlands, and it has been suggested to be related to climate change through effects of reduction in sea-ice extent during winter and a consequent decline in the abundance of krill.

J	Fauchald, P; Tveraa, T				Fauchald, Per; Tveraa, Torkild			Hierarchical patch dynamics and animal movement pattern	OECOLOGIA												In hierarchical patch systems, small-scale patches of high density are nested within large-scale patches of low density. The organization of multiple-scale hierarchical systems makes non-random strategies for dispersal and movement particularly important. Here, we apply a new method based on first-passage time on the pathway of a foraging seabird, the Antarctic petrel (Thalassoica antarctica), to quantify its foraging pattern and the spatial dynamics of its foraging areas. Our results suggest that Antarctic petrels used a nested search strategy to track a highly dynamic hierarchical patch system where small-scale patches were congregated within patches at larger scales. The birds searched for large-scale patches by traveling fast and over long distances. Once within a large-scale patch, the birds concentrated their search to find smaller scale patches. By comparing the pathway of different birds we were able to quantify the spatial scale and turnover of their foraging areas. On the largest scale we found foraging areas with a characteristic scale of about 400 km. Nested within these areas we found foraging areas with a characteristic scale of about 100 km. The large-scale areas disappeared or moved within a time frame of weeks while the nested small-scale areas disappeared or moved within days. Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) is the dominant food item of Antarctic petrels and we suggest that our findings reflect the spatial dynamics of krill in the area.

The gentoo penguin (Pygoscelis papua), a specialized diving seabird that preys on krill and fish, is distributed from the sub-Antarctic islands to Antarctic regions. Here, we observed the diving behavior of breeding gentoo penguins on King George Island, South Shetland Islands, Antarctica. Using a time-depth recorder, we collected diving depths every second from seven gentoo breeders for 5-21 days during the chick-rearing period and analyzed their diving characteristics. Most dives occurred in shallow water, although the dive efficiency (=bottom duration time/[dive duration + post-dive surface time]) was highest at depths of 30-35 m and decreased as the penguins dove deeper. Gentoo penguins did not dive more frequently during the day than at night, but during nighttime, most dives occurred in shallow water (<20 m) and the dive efficiency was also higher at this time. As penguins repeated their foraging trips, the number of dives, depth of dives, and trip duration did not change significantly. Our results suggest that the diel dive patterns of gentoo penguins might be related to the vertical migration of krill (upward to the surface at night). In addition, we observed that gentoo penguins could perform active diving behavior even at night, possibly aided by civil twilight during the chick-rearing period in Antarctic regions.																	1976-8354	2151-2485				JUL 4	2015	19	4					274	281		10.1080/19768354.2015.1074107							WOS:000360224200007

The biochemical estimation of age in Euphausiids: Laboratory calibration and field comparisons	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY												Euphausiids play a key role in many marine ecosystems as a link between primary producers and top predators. Understanding their demographic (i.e. age) structure is an essential tool to assess growth and recruitment as well as to determine how changes in environmental conditions might alter their condition and distribution. Age determination of crustaceans cannot be accomplished using traditional approaches, and here we evaluate the potential for biochemical products of tissue metabolism (termed lipofuscins) to determine the demographic structure of euphausiids in field collections. Lipofuscin was extracted from krill neural tissues (eye and eye-stalk), quantified using fluorescent intensity and normalized to tissue protein content to allow comparisons across animal sizes. Multiple fluorescent components from krill were observed, with the major product having a maximum fluorescence at excitation of 355 nm and emission of 510 nm. Needed age calibration of lipofuscin accumulation in Euphausia pacifica was accomplished using known-age individuals hatched and reared in the laboratory for over one year. Lipofuscin content extracted from neural tissues of laboratory-reared animals was highly correlated with the chronological age of animals (r=0.87). Calibrated with laboratory lipofuscin accumulation rates, field-collected sub-adult and adult E. pacifica in the Northeast Pacific were estimated to be older than 100 days and younger than 1 year. Comparative data for the Antarctic krill, E. superba showed much higher lipofuscin values suggesting a much longer lifespan than the more temperate species, E. pacifica. These regional comparisons suggest that biochemical indices allow a practical approach to estimate population age structure of diverse populations, and combined with other measurements can provide estimates of vital rates (i.e. longevity, mortality, growth) for krill populations in dynamic environments.

This is unexpected due to the lack of obvious barriers to gene flow and strong current systems. Using mitochondrial (COI, 16S rDNA) and nuclear (28S rDNA: D2) gene fragments, we tested whether two circum-Antarctic benthic shrimps with planktotrophic larvae, Chorismus antarcticus and Nematocarcinus lanceopes, show patterns of regional differentiation. For both species, the 16S and the 28S fragment were invariant. However, for COI we found 24 different haplotypes for Chorismus antarcticus and 54 for Nematocarcinus lanceopes. No significant differentiation was observed among populations or regions. Furthermore, we found signatures of a population expansion in the late Pleistocene hinting at an impact of large-scale glaciations in particular on the shallow-water shrimp Chorismus antarcticus, supporting a (re)colonization and demographic expansion of this shrimp species in response to climate oscillation.

Impacts on phytoplankton dynamics by free-drifting icebergs in the NW Weddell Sea	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY												Glacier ice released to the oceans through iceberg formation has a complex effect on the surrounding ocean waters. We hypothesized that phytoplankton communities would differ in abundance, composition and production around or close to an iceberg. This paper tests the influence of individual icebergs on scales of meters to kilometers, observed through shipboard oceanographic sampling on March-April 2009. Surface waters (integrated 0-100 m depth, within the euphotic zone) sampled close to the iceberg C-18a ( <1 km) were characterized by lower temperatures, more dissolved nitrate, less total chlorophyll a (chla) concentration, less picoplankton ( <3 mu m) cell abundance, and higher transparency than surface conditions 18 km upstream. However, enrichment of large cells, identified as diatoms, was the basis of an active food chain. Upward velocity of meltwater and dissolved Fe concentrations in excess of 1-2 nM are expected to facilitate diatom specific growth. The presence of diatoms close to the iceberg C-18a and the higher variable fluorescence (Fv/Fm) indicated healthy cells, consistent with Antarctic waters rich in micronutrients. Furthermore, chla increased significantly 2 km around the iceberg and 10 days after the iceberg's passage. We hypothesize that the lower biomass next to the iceberg was due to high loss rates. Underwater melting is expected to dilute phytoplankton near the iceberg by entraining deep water or by introducing meltwater. In addition, high zooplankton biomass within 2 km of the iceberg, mainly Antarctic krill Euphausia superba and salps Salpa thompsonii, are expected to exert heavy grazing pressure on phytoplankton, the krill on large cells >10 mu m and the salps on smaller cells, 3-10 mu m. The iceberg's main influence in the austral fall is measured not so much by phytoplankton accumulation but by reactivation of the classic Antarctic food chain, facilitating diatom growth and sustaining high Antarctic krill populations.

Population dynamics of Salpa thompsoni near the Antarctic Peninsula: Growth rates and interannual variations in reproductive activity (1993-2009)	PROGRESS IN OCEANOGRAPHY												The salp Salpa thompsoni has exhibited increased abundance in high latitude portions of the Southern Ocean in recent decades and is now frequently the numerically dominant zooplankton taxon in the Antarctic Peninsula region. The abundance increase of this species in high latitude waters is believed related to ocean warming. Due to its continuous filter feeding and production of dense rapidly sinking fecal pellets S. thompsoni is considered to be an important link in the export of particulate carbon from the surface waters. Hence basic information on the life history of this component of the Antarctic marine ecosystem is essential for assessing its impact given continued climate warming. Here we cover various aspects of the life history of S. thompsoni collected in the north Antarctic Peninsula during annual austral summer surveys of the US Antarctic Marine Living Resources (AMLR) Program between 1993 and 2009. We focus on seasonal and interannual variations in the size composition and abundance of the aggregate (sexual) and solitary (asexual) stages. This information is valuable for refining components of Southern Ocean food web models that explicitly deal with size-structured and life history information on zooplankton. Intraseasonal changes in length-frequency distribution of both stages are used to estimate their growth rates. These average 0.40 mm day(-1) for aggregates and 0.23 mm day(-1) for solitaries; together these represent similar to 7 week and similar to 7.5 month generation times, respectively, and a 9 month life cycle (i.e., onset of aggregate production year 1 to aggregate production year 2). Based on the maximum lengths typically found during January-March, the life spans of the aggregate and solitary stages can reach at least similar to 5 and similar to 15 months, respectively. Length-frequency distributions each year reflect interannual differences in timing of the initiation and peak reproductive output. Interannual differences in the abundance of total salps and proportions of the overwintering solitary stage are significantly correlated with El Nino Southern Oscillation indices (SOI and Nino3.4) prevailing over the previous 2 years. Massive salp blooms result from two successive summers of elevated solitary production following a reversal from La Nina to El Nino conditions. These results indicate the role of basin-scale atmospheric-oceanic processes in establishing optimal conditions that support aggregate and solitary stage reproduction, development and growth.

Inter-annual sea-ice dynamics and micro-algal biomass in winter pack ice of Marguerite Bay, Antarctica	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY												The geographic remoteness, the lack of remote sensing capabilities, and the lack of appropriate environmental sensors make the detection of seasonal trends or inter-annual variations in sea-ice microbial biomass or production processes within the pack ice of the Antarctic extremely rare. The evaluation of their inter-annual variability in the context of ice dynamics and trends in regional climate has not been possible. During the late winters of 2001 (July-August) and 2002 (August-September) we assessed sea-ice dynamics, sea-ice characteristics, and biomass of sea-ice microbiota along the Western Antarctic Peninsula. These two winters were marked by large contrasts in the dates of initial ice formation (late June in 2001 and April in 2002), which resulted in differences in the physical pack-ice characteristics. Chlorophyll a (chl a) content in ice cores differed between the study years, with 2002 having 10-fold higher chl a content. The difference in ice-core chl a content is best explained by the timing of ice formation that leads to less phytoplankton scavenging from the water column and a lack of transfer of solar energy into the pack-ice ecosystem. Such a tractable atmosphere ocean-ice-biota coupling may help in evaluating underlying processes responsible for long-term trends in recruitment cycles of upper trophic levels as well as future projections on the response of the Antarctic marine ecosystems to variability in local climate.

J	Zhou, XQ; Zhu, GP; Hu, S				Zhou, Xiangqian; Zhu, Guoping; Hu, Song			Influence of tides on mass transport in the Bransfield Strait and the adjacent areas, Antarctic	POLAR SCIENCE												The Bransfield Strait and the adjacent areas is a high-productivity region for polar biological resources in the Antarctic. Physical oceanographic processes produce strong ecosystem dynamics via mass transport and water exchange. However, few studies have focused on these processes from coast to shelf and across slopes by tidal dynamics. Therefore, a numerical model was implemented with a high resolution to simulate the influence of the tide on mass transport. The output of the model indicated that the tidal residual current produced by the diurnal tide is dominant and primarily distributed along with the shelf break and near the coast, and water stratification amplifies this residual current system. Water exchange processes were evaluated utilizing passive tracer dyes to demonstrate the influence of the tides on the channel and bay. The tracer residence time ranged from a few days to a week and was affected by the considered representative region's topography and area. Correspondingly, Lagrangian particles tracking method is also used to illustrate the mass transportation, which primarily move along the isobaths on the slope but spiral on the flat shelf. All experiments conducted herein indicate that tidal dynamics is indispensable in this region when studying cross-shelf mass transport.

Pelagic swarms and beach strandings of the squat lobster Munida gregaria (Anomura: Munididae) in the Beagle Channel, Tierra del Fuego	POLAR BIOLOGY												The present article is the first formal record of pelagic swarms and beach strandings of the squat lobster Munida gregaria in the Beagle Channel, southern South America. To describe size composition and natural diet of beach strandings and swarms, samples from strandings were taken in April 2007, March 2008 and March 2010. Samples from swarms were taken in May 2007 and April 2010. Also, during November 2008 and January 2009, two acoustic surveys were carried out to describe both, horizontal distribution and school metrics of swarms. Pelagic swarms and beach strandings were composed of 100% individuals of the morph gregaria of M. gregaria. Mean size of males and females in both, beach strandings and swarms, were similar. The diet of pelagic M. gregaria was composed mainly of crustaceans, unicellular algae and small macroalgae, sediment and particulate organic matter. Swarms of pelagic Munida took the shape of extended layers of varying density and height. Their positions in the water column were also variable: swarms were found at different depths, from the subsurface layer to near the sea bottom. Occasionally, some large swarms occupied most of the water column. In the Beagle Channel, SW winds during spring tides could be a forcing factor for M. gregaria strandings. The absence of shoaling animals in the Beagle Channel between 1997 and 2002 and the recent occurrence of swarms are coincident with their appearance in other locations in Patagonia. In consequence, we hypothesize that the factor influencing the formation of swarms must be acting at a regional scale.

Seasonal changes in the diet and feeding behaviour of a top predator indicate a flexible response to deteriorating oceanographic conditions	MARINE BIOLOGY												Shifts in the diet of top predators can be linked to changes in environmental conditions. In this study, we tested relationships between environmental variation and seasonal changes in diet of a top predator, the grey-headed albatross Thalassarche chrysostoma, breeding at Bird Island, South Georgia in an austral summer of 1999/2000. Oceanographic conditions in that year around South Georgia were abnormal (i.e. anomalously high sea surface temperature to a relative 19-year long-term mean). The diet of grey-headed albatrosses showed high seasonal variation, shifting from cephalopods (42.9 % by mass) in late February to Antarctic krill Euphausia superba (58.3 %) in late April, and grey-headed albatrosses breeding performance was low (16.8 %). This study shows these albatrosses did not manage to find sufficient alternative prey and highlight the risk to top predators if there is an increase in the frequency or severity of food shortages in Antarctic waters.

Spatial niche partitioning may promote coexistence of Pygoscelis penguins as climate-induced sympatry occurs	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION												Climate-induced range overlap can result in novel interactions between similar species and potentially lead to competitive exclusion. The West Antarctic Peninsula (WAP) is one of the most rapidly warming regions on Earth and is experiencing a poleward climate migration from a polar to subpolar environment. This has resulted in a range expansion of the ice-intolerant gentoo penguins (Pygoscelis papua) and a coincident decrease in ice-obligate Adelie penguins (P.adeliae) near Palmer Station, Anvers Island, WAP. Ecologically similar species that share a limited prey resource must occupy disparate foraging niches in order to co-exist. Therefore, we determined the extent of foraging and dietary niche segregation between Adelie and gentoo penguins during the austral breeding season near Palmer Station. This research was conducted across six breeding seasons, from 2009 to 2014, which allowed us to investigate niche overlap in the context of interannual resource variability. Using biotelemetry and diet sampling, we found substantial overlap in the diets of Adelie and gentoo penguins, who primarily consumed Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba); however, our results showed that Adelie and gentoo penguins partitioned this shared prey resource through horizontal segregation of their core foraging areas. We did not find evidence that Antarctic krill were a limiting resource during the breeding season or that climate-induced sympatry of Adelie and gentoo penguins resulted in competition for prey or caused the subsequent differing population trajectories. This apparent absence of resource competition between Adelie and gentoo penguins throughout this study implies that current population trends in this region are governed by other biological and physical factors. Our results highlight the importance of understanding the mechanistic processes that influence top predator populations in the context of climate-driven ecosystem shifts.																	2045-7758					OCT	2018	8	19					9764	9778		10.1002/ece3.4445							WOS:000448803000017	30386573

Extreme diel variation in the feeding behavior of humpback whales along the western Antarctic Peninsula during autumn	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												Most humpback whale Megaptera novaeangliae populations partition their time between prey-rich feeding and prey-deficient breeding/calving regions. How these whales feed and optimize the consumption of prey resources prior to long-distance migrations and fasting is largely unknown. We deployed multi-sensor tags on humpback whales around the western Antarctic Peninsula to describe their daily activity patterns late in the feeding season to test the hypothesis that feeding behavior varies over the diel cycle so as to maximize energy intake and limit energy expenditure. Dives were assigned to a behavioral state (feeding, resting, traveling, exploring) to determine hourly rates and to build an ethogram of activity patterns. Our results show a distinct diel pattern of whales feeding exclusively at night. Feeding depth was deeper around sunrise/sunset and shallower (similar to 50 m) at night, consistent with diel vertical prey movement. Shallow feeding dives typically contained a single feeding lunge, a strategy known to increase feeding efficiency and maximize intake rates by maintaining proximity to the surface and reducing the energetic costs of deep diving. The lack of feeding during daytime may indicate prey being too deep for efficient foraging. Our results add information where currently there is a paucity of data describing how baleen whales optimize feeding behavior, specifically in relation to prey distribution and movement, to fuel their extraordinary energetic requirements necessary for growth, migration, and reproduction. Understanding behavioral patterns and predator/prey dynamics in rapidly changing marine environments, like the Antarctic Peninsula, is critical for understanding how these changes will affect ecosystem structure and function.

J	Taylor, MH; Losch, M; Bracher, A				Taylor, Marc H.; Losch, Martin; Bracher, Astrid			On the drivers of phytoplankton blooms in the Antarctic marginal ice zone: A modeling approach	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS												The pelagic province of the Southern Ocean generally has low levels of primary production attributable to a short growing season in the higher latitudes, a deep mixed layer, and iron limitation. Exceptions include phytoplankton blooms in the marginal ice zone (MIZ) during spring and summer sea-ice retreat. The prevailing hypothesis as to the drivers of the blooms is that sea-ice retreat increases the vertical stability of the water column through the production of melt water and provides shelter from wind mixing in areas of partial sea-ice coverage. These conditions are favorable to phytoplankton growth by allowing them to maintain their position in the upper reaches of the water column. This work investigates the drivers of MIZ blooms using a biochemically coupled global circulation model. Results support the hypothesis in that physical conditions related to a shallow, vertically stable water column (e. g., mixed layer depth and available light) were the most significant predictors of bloom dynamics, while nutrient limitation was of lesser importance. We estimate that MIZ blooms account for 15% of yearly net primary production in the Southern Ocean and that the earlier phases of the MIZ bloom, occurring under partial ice coverage and invisible to remote sensing, account for about two thirds of this production. MIZ blooms were not found to enhance depth-integrated net primary production when compared to similar ecological provinces outside of the MIZ, although the elevated phytoplankton concentrations in surface waters are hypothesized to provide important feeding habitats for grazing organisms such as krill.

A total of 195 individuals were captured. The species collected were Galiteuthis glacialis, Mesonychoteuthis hamiltoni, Histioteuthis atlantica, H. eltaninae, Alluroteuthis antarcticus, Batoteuthis skolops and Pholidoteuthis boschmai. Concentrations of squid were low, ranging from 4.4 to 174.7 individuals 100,000(-3). The majority of squid captured were G. glacialis (174 individuals, 89.2% of all squid captured), and most of these (n = 171) were small paralarvae < 25 mm in mantle length. G. glacialis were distributed predominantly west of 120&DEG;E in water that was colder, and where the distance from the coastline of the southern boundary of the Antarctic circumpolar current (SB-ACC) was maximal. This water mass had greater concentrations of phytoplankton, was more productive and had maximal sea-ice extent compared to the water mass east of 120&DEG;E. G. glacialis was therefore more abundant in water where the majority of krill and krill predators were present compared to warmer oceanic waters of the ACC to the east, where salps dominated.

Annual primary production in Antarctic sea ice during 2005-2006 from a sea ice state estimate	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS												Using the data-bounded Sea Ice Ecosystem State (SIESTA) model, we estimate total Antarctic sea ice algal primary production to be 23.7 Tg C a(-1) for the period July 2005-June 2006, of which 80% occurred in the bottom 0.2 m of ice. Simulated sea ice primary production would constitute 12% of total annual primary production in the Antarctic sea ice zone, and similar to 1% of annual Southern Ocean primary production. Model sea ice algal growth was net nutrient limited, rather than light limited, for the vast majority of the sunlit season. The seasonal distribution of integrated ice algal biomass matches available observations. The vertical algal distribution was weighted toward the ice bottom compared to observations, indicating that interior ice algal communities may be under-predicted in the model, and that nutrient delivery via gravity-induced convection is not sufficient to sustain summertime algal biomass. Bottom ice algae were most productive in ice of 0.36 m thickness, whereas interior algal communities were most productive in ice of 1.10 m thickness. Sensitivity analyses that tested different atmospheric forcing inputs, sea ice parameterizations, and nutrient availability caused mean and regional shifts in sea ice state and ice algal production even when sea extent and motion was specified. The spatial heterogeneity of both ice state and algal production highlight the sensitivity of the sea ice ecosystem to physical perturbation, and demonstrate the importance of quality input data and appropriate parameterizations to models of sea ice and associated biology.																	2169-9275	2169-9291				JUN	2014	119	6					3645	3678		10.1002/2013JC009677							WOS:000340414800024

A total of 2956 leopard seal sightings were made, and 121 seals were tagged during the study, mainly between 1993 and 1996. Photographs of scars and pelage patterns were also used to identify a subset of these individuals across years, which provided no evidence of tag loss between or within years. Leopard seals were observed between April and November; the mean time between the first and last sightings in each year was 208 d (s d +/- 48). Between 1993-96, eight seals were resident around the island for more than 100 d, and the longest recorded residence was 130 d. The proportion of tagged seals resighted was 0.35 and 0.17 in 1995 and 1996 respectively. Based on estimates of body length, <5% of the seals were juveniles (0-1 years) and >70% were not sexually mature. There was considerable inter-annual variation in abundance, with a maximum of 502 sightings during 1994, compared with a minimum of 21 during 1986 and 1989. Antarctic fur seals (Arctocephalus gazella) were the main prey item (58% of kills observed and 53% of seats). Other items included penguins (28% of kills observed and 20% of seats) and fish (24% of seats). Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba), southern elephant seals (Mirounga leonina) and seabirds other than penguins were also present in the diet in small quantities.				Tony R.

Confirmation of neutral buoyancy in Aethotaxis mitopteryx DeWitt (Notothenioidei : Nototheniidae)	POLAR BIOLOGY												Aethotaxis mitopteryx is a nototheniid species with a circum-Antarctic distribution in the Southern Ocean. We present new locality records, buoyancy measurements, and morphometric data on five A. mitopteryx specimens collected from the Bransfield Strait. Our analyses demonstrate that A. mitopteryx is neutrally buoyant. This result lends additional support to the hypothesis that neutral buoyancy has a single evolutionary origin in Notothenioidei. Food items in these specimens consisted entirely of krill (Euphausia sp.), and all specimens were sexually immature. We present morphometric data from these five specimens and compare to the holotype specimen, which is the only A. mitopteryx specimen collected in the Ross Sea.

Thirty-four seals (16 M 18 F) were outfitted with Satellite Relay Data Loggers (SRDLs) in the Marguerite Bay Region of the Antarctic Peninsula (similar to67degreesS, 67degreesW) during the austral winters of 2001 and 2002. Tags transmitted position and dive information for between 4 and 174 days. Overall, winter activity patterns differed significantly from previously reported data collected during the summer: seals in this study dived deeper (92 +/- 0.2 m, range 6-713 m) and longer (5.26 min +/- 0.6, range 0.2-23.6 min), hauled out during the night rather than the day, and showed seasonal shifts in foraging patterns consistent with foraging on vertically migrating prey. While these patterns were more pronounced in 2001 than in 2002, there were no strong differences in patterns of habitat use between the 2 years. Some animals made long distance movements (furthest movements 664 km to northeast, 1147 km to southwest), but most seals remained within 300 km of their tagging location. Within the Marguerite Bay/Crystal Sound region, seals appeared to favor foraging locations on the continental shelf within the 50 to 450 m depth range, with a tendency to avoid depths of 600 m or greater. In both years, seals remained deep within the pack ice throughout the winter, and did not move into regions with less ice cover. Seals were more likely to be located in shallow water where the bathymetric gradients were greatest, and in areas of higher sea-ice concentration. In combination, these findings suggest that crabeater seals alter their behavior to accommodate seasonal and/or annual fluctuations in seasonal sea ice and associate with bathymetric features likely to concentrate prey patches.

J	Smith, PJ; Gaffney, PM				Smith, PJ; Gaffney, PM			Low genetic diversity in the antarctic toothfish (Dissostichus mawsoni) observed with mitochondrial and intron DNA markers	CCAMLR SCIENCE												Two molecular methods, mitochondrial and intron DNA markers, were used to determine genetic relationships among Antarctic toothfish (Dissostichus mawsoni) samples from three CCAMLR areas: Subareas 48.1 and 88.1 and Division 58.4.2. D. mawsoni appeared to be characterised by low diversity; no genetic variation was detected with restriction enzyme digests of nine sub-regions of the mitochondrial genome. Polymorphisms were found in four of seven introns digested with the restriction enzymes, but there was no population differentiation among the three sea areas. Direct sequencing of cytochrome b (665 bp) and the left domain of the control region (639 bp) showed very little variation and no significant genetic differentiation among sea areas.																	1023-4063						2005	12						43	51									WOS:000233386600004

Radiocarbon dates place the age of these deposits from a maximum of 947 years ago to the present. We identified 12 taxa of fish and two of squid with the Antarctic silverfish (Pleuragramma antarcticum) as the most abundant prey species represented at all sites. In addition, silverfish have decreased in importance in Adelie penguin diet over the past 600 years, perhaps in response to climate change since the onset of the Little Ice Age, though it remains much more abundant in current penguin diet in the Ross Sea than in the Antarctic Peninsula. Other prey taxa reflect the diversity of prey selection by Adelie penguins in Antarctica.

In this study, we collected a sediment core from the Fildes Peninsula of West Antarctica, and used cholesterol, cholestanol, epicoprostanol, coprostanol, and seal hair numbers as the proxy indicators of seal population size and phytol as of general vegetation, and we reconstructed the 20th century history of variation of the seal population and vegetation abundance on this island. The sealing industry in the early 20th century caused the dramatic decline of seal population, and the ban of seal hunting since the 1960s led to its recovery of seal population. The seal population during the past century was primarily controlled by human activities and krill density. The reconstructed relation between seal population and vegetation abundance may offer new insights into Antarctic environment and ecology.

An increase in the number of reported departures from this feeding/fasting model suggests that the current model may be oversimplified or, alternatively, undergoing contemporary change. Information about the feeding and fasting cycles of the two Australian breeding populations of humpback whales were obtained through stable isotope analysis of baleen plates from stranded adult individuals. Comparison of isotope profiles showed that individuals from the West Australian breeding population strongly adhered to the classical feeding model. By contrast, East Australian population individuals demonstrated greater heterogeneity in their feeding. On a spectrum from exclusive Antarctic feeding to exclusive feeding in temperate waters, three different strategies were assigned and discussed: classical feeders, supplemental feeders, and temperate zone feeders. Diversity in the inter-annual feeding strategies of humpback whales demonstrates the feeding plasticity of the species, but could also be indicative of changing dynamics within the Antarctic sea-ice ecosystem. This study presents the first investigation of trophodynamics in Southern hemisphere humpback whales derived from baleen plates, and further provides the first estimates of baleen plate elongation rates in the species.

J	Farber-Lorda, J; Mayzaud, P				Faerber-Lorda, Jaime; Mayzaud, Patrick			Morphology and total lipids in Thysanoessa macura from the southern part of the Indian Ocean during summer. Spatial and sex differences	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY												Samples obtained during austral summer (February) were utilized to study the morphological differences of Thysanoessa macrura and the total lipid content, in relation to sex and geographic location. This species shows an evolution in morphometry, its carapace length increases slightly with sexual maturation, and its second thoracic leg becomes bigger and stronger, as well as its dactylus and especially the setae in the dactylus, which are stronger in a bigger animal allowing them to feed on other lipid-rich zooplankton. All these characteristics seem to support the hypothesis that animals change their diet during this period, allowing them to grow faster during summer, and accumulate lipids as a reserve material. This hypothesis is supported by a steeper slope in the length-weight regression during summer and an even steeper slope of the regression between carapace length and total lipids, especially adults. Great differences in lipid content were found between subadults and adults during this season, being higher in adults and, especially females. Lipids were higher in the northern stations in frontal area. A significant difference in lipid content was found among the stations sampled. Also a significant difference in lipid content was found between subadults, males and females. The species has a longer reproductive season than previously thought, which could depend on local conditions. Its development is accelerated during the summer bloom. Life history strategies of subadults and adults are apparently quite different, according to our lipid results and morphometrics data. Lipids reserves in subadults are not accumulated during summer, thus. T. macrura must accumulate massive amounts of lipids during autumn or late summer as a survival strategy of the species, as proposed for other species. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Thysanoessa macrura was caught in open waters while Calanoides acutus and Calanus propinquus were mainly sampled between ice floes in the marginal ice zone. The "ice-krill" Euphausia crystallorophias was found over the shelf directly associated with ice flees. T. macrura had a lipid content up to 36% of its dry weight with the dominant lipid class, wax ester, accounting for 45-50% of the total lipid. The predominance of 18:1 fatty alcohols is the striking characteristic of the wax esters. Small specimens of E. crystallorophias had lipid levels up to 26% of their dry weight with, unexpectedly, triacylglycerols being the dominant lipid (up to 41% of total lipid). The small levels of wax esters in these animals (3-6% of total lipid) had phytol as a major constituent. Large specimens of E. crystallorophias had up to 34% of their dry weight as lipid, with wax esters (47% of total lipid) dominated by 16:0 and 14:0 fatty alcohols as the major lipid. Calanus propinquus had lipid levels of up to 34% of their dry weight, with triacylglycerols (up to 63% of total lipid) being the dominant lipid. High levels of 22:1 (n-9) fatty acid were present in the triacylglycerols. Calanoides acutus had lipid levels up to 35% of the dry weight with wax esters accounting for up to 83% of total lipid. High levels of (n-3) polyunsaturated fatty acids were recorded with 20:5(n-3), 22:6(n-3) and 18:4(n-3) being the dominant moieties. On the basis of their lipid compositions we deduce that: (1) Calanoides acutus is the strictest herbivore among the four species studied, heavily utilizing the typical spring bloom; (2) T. macrura is essentially omnivorous, probably utilizing the less defined bloom situations found in oceanic waters; (3) E. crystallorophias is an omnivore well adapted to utilize both a bloom situation and to feed on ice algae and micro-zooplankton associated with the ice; (4) Calanus propinquus seems to be the most opportunistic feeder of the four species studied, probably grazing heavily on phytoplankton during a bloom and, during the rest of the year, feeding on whatever material is available, including particulates, flagellates and other ice-associated algae. We conclude that the different biochemical pathways generating large oil reserves of different compositions, enabling species to utilize different ecological niches, are major determinants of biodiversity in polar zooplankton.

Growth in standard length (L-S) was estimated using the exponential model. Among the seven cohorts, average growth rate varied between 0.33-2.1% L-S d(-1), and predicted L-S for mid-January varied between 21.6-29.1 mm. Average growth rate was inversely related to mean date of sampling but was not significantly related to mean L-S. Mean sea surface temperatures were available for the 1981-95 cohorts. Average growth rate and predicted L-S for mid-January were both negatively correlated with mean December-January sea temperature, but were not significantly related to mean weekly sea surface temperature during the sampling periods. Greater average growth rate and greater L-S in cooler summers may be partly due to a large-scale pattern of environmental variability, indicated by sea temperature, that governs the timing and magnitude of the production cycle and food availability.																	0954-1020					DEC	1998	10	4					416	422		10.1017/S0954102098000509							WOS:000077839300007

Spatial-temporal relationships between two euphausiid species in the Ross Sea	CHEMISTRY AND ECOLOGY					Joint Scientific Meeting of the National-Inter-University-Consortium-For-Marine-Sciences/XVI Congress of the Italian-Association-for-Oceanology-and-Limnology	OCT 18-22, 2004	Palermo, ITALY	CoNISMa, AIOL				This paper summarizes the results obtained during the Italian marine Antarctic expeditions to the Ross Sea in November and December 1994, December 1997, and January 2000. The distribution and abundance of the two krill species (Euphausia superba and Euphausia crystallorophias) are shown in relation to the degree of ice cover, and a potential mechanism is presented that allows the coexistence of the two similar species in the same region. The surveys indicate that the northern and north-western areas of the Ross Sea are largely dominated by Euphausia superba, while the southern and southwestern areas are dominated by Euphausia crystallorophias. The two krill populations show some overlap in the central part of the Ross Sea, where the distribution of the two species appears related to the ice cover. The biomass centroids of the two krill species seem to move northward associated with the ice edge retreat in summer. The centroid of the Euphausia superba biomass moves much faster and further than that of Euphausia crystallorophias and reaches ice-free waters at the edge of the Ross Sea in summer. This suggests that the spatial extent of the Euphausia superba population may extend beyond the Ross Sea, and a portion of this population may spread into the ocean waters starting in early January. In contrast, the Euphausia crystallorophias population appears to be restricted to the Ross Sea.

J	Xavier, JC; Croxall, JP; Trathan, PN; Wood, AG				Xavier, JC; Croxall, JP; Trathan, PN; Wood, AG			Feeding strategies and diets of breeding grey-headed and wandering albatrosses at South Georgia	MARINE BIOLOGY												The foraging areas and diets of the grey-headed albatross Thalassarche chrysostoma and wandering albatross Diomedea exulans were studied in March/April 2000 at Bird Island, South Georgia, during their respective chick-rearing and brood-guard periods. Oceanographically, March/April 2000 was abnormal, with warm conditions close to South Georgia. These conditions affected albatross foraging behaviour, particularly that of grey-headed albatrosses. Both species tended to forage in different areas of the ocean, with significant differences in trip durations. Grey-headed albatrosses (n = 9) foraged mainly in Antarctic waters (predominantly shelf waters of the South Shetland Islands and Antarctic Peninsula, and also in oceanic waters around South Georgia), feeding mainly on krill (Euphausia superba; 77% by mass). Foraging trips lasted 13.3 days (range: 5-26 days), far longer than the 1-3 days found in previous studies. Only one grey-headed albatross was associated with the APF (Antarctic Polar Front), a reported foraging area in recent studies. Wandering albatrosses (n=9) foraged in Antarctic (South Georgia Shelf) and Antarctic Polar Frontal Zone (APFZ) waters, with trips of 1-4 days trip duration (usual for this species), feeding on fish (46% by mass) and cephalopods (32%). One bird was associated with the APF, and two birds foraged on the shelf/shelf break over the Patagonian shelf. These findings suggest that sea surface temperature anomalies, produced by movement of the APF closer to South Georgia or by eddies, may have had an effect on the foraging strategy of greyheaded albatrosses that year (the main prey of grey-headed albatrosses in previous studies, the omma-strephid Martialia hyadesi, is known to be associated with the APF). Also, when both albatross breeding periods overlap, their foraging areas were complementary, which reflected the prey taken.					/0000-0002-9621-6660												0025-3162					AUG	2003	143	2					221	232		10.1007/s00227-003-1049-0							WOS:000185536900002

The lipid content, lipid class, fatty acid and sterol composition of E. superba fed on each cultured phytoplankton and a mixed diet of both species, were determined. No significant difference was found between total lipid levels of E. superba reared on each of these different diets. Phaeocystis pouchetii, although deficient in a number of the essential fatty acids, is apparently an adequate food source for E. superba. The proportion of polyenoic fatty acids varied within lipid classes although there was no significant difference between levels of the long chain polyunsaturate 20:5(n-3) in the total lipid of E. superba fed on these diets. The acid was found to be less than 1% of the total lipid in Phaeocystis pouchetii compared to 37% in Phaeodactylum tricornutum. This suggests that krill may possess the ability to convert exogenous shorter chain fatty acids to 20:5(n-3) and 22:6(n-3). Significant differences were detected in the isomeric ratio of 16:1(n-7c)/16:0 between krill fed the diatom compared to the prymnesiophyte diet. Significant differences were also detected in several shorter chain fatty acids and between fatty acids within their lipid classes. Such differences may have the potential to be used as biochemical signatures to provide information on food sources and possible feeding grounds of E. superba. Phaeocystis pouchetii in a very late stationary phase, although not used in this feeding study, was found to contain 11% of 22:6(n-3) for which there are few substantive sources in natural algal populations.

J	Nordoy, ES; Blix, AS				Nordoy, E. S.; Blix, A. S.			Movements and dive behaviour of two leopard seals (Hydrurga leptonyx) off Queen Maud Land, Antarctica	POLAR BIOLOGY												Two adult female leopard seals (Hydrurga leptonyx) were tagged with satellite-linked dive recorders off Queen Maud Land, Antarctica, just after moulting in mid-February. The transmitters transmitted for 80 and 220 days, respectively. Both seals remained within the pack ice relatively close to the Antarctic Continent until early May, when contact was lost with one seal. The one remaining seal then migrated north, to the east side of the South Sandwich Islands in 3 weeks, whereafter it headed east, until contact was lost at 55A degrees S in early September. From mid-May to late September this animal always stayed close to the edge of the pack ice. Both seals made mostly short (< 5 min) dives to depths of 10-50 m and only occasionally dove deeper than 200 m, the deepest dive recorded being 304 m. A nocturnal diving pattern was evident in autumn and early winter, while day-time diving prevailed in mid-winter. Haul out probability was highest at mid-day (about 40% in late February and more than 80% in March and April). From May till September the remaining animal mainly stayed at sea, in the vicinity of the pack ice, with only occasional haul outs. These data suggest that a portion of the adult leopard seals may spend the winter mainly in open water, off the edge of the pack ice, where they primarily hunt near the surface. In that case, it is likely that krill (Euphausia superba), as well as penguins, young crabeater seals (Lobodon carcinophaga) and a variety of fish are important prey items.																	0722-4060	1432-2056				FEB	2009	32	2					263	270		10.1007/s00300-008-0527-8							WOS:000262439300014

The stomach content analysis was carried out on larval and postlarval specimens ranging from 14 to 39 mm SL. Unlike larvae and juveniles of other channichthyids, which elsewhere largely rely on early life stages of Antarctic krill or ice krill, no euphausiids were found in the stomach contents of C. hamatus, except for a single large individual of Thysanoessa macrura. In both years, dietary composition consisted almost exclusively of notothenioid fish larvae. Early larvae of Pleuragramma antarcticum overwhelmingly dominated the diet in terms of abundance, biomass and frequency of occurrence, accounting for 98.4% of the index of relative importance (IRI). Other fish larvae consumed occasionally in small amount were Trematomus lepidorhinus, T. scotti and C. hamatus itself. As a result, the feeding strategy of C. hamatus was considerably shifted toward specialization, relying on relatively few taxa of prey, each of them showing a high prey-specific abundance. Comparing both dietary composition and feeding strategy of C. hamatus in the two different sampling years, several differences were observed, probably due to different environmental conditions, mainly linked to a significant delay of ice retreat and formation of the Ross Sea polynya verified in the 2003-2004 summer season.

Examination of scats containing prey remains showed that fur seals fed mainly on krill, occurring in 100% of samples but fish were also a common food item (78.8%).

Here, we present a framework for assessing the status and trends of key ocean habitat components using synoptic data sources. It aims to quantify ecosystem variability and long-term change, and to provide summaries and indicators of change at scales that are both ecologically meaningful and relevant for management. We illustrate our approach using the Southern Ocean as a case-study and assess habitat based on remotely-sensed sea ice concentration, sea surface temperature (SST) and chlorophyll-a. We use Antarctic krill Euphausia superba as an illustrative example of how thresholds and optimum ranges for key taxa (and the ranges they define) can be used to delimit areas that are likely to constitute "good" habitat. Availability of "good" habitat, in terms of area, provides a simple indicator for quantifying change through time, and for assessing regional differences. Our assessment of sea ice reveals that the absence of a strong trend in the mean annual duration of sea ice cover around Antarctica masks a loss of areas with the longest periods of cover. In the polar latitudinal zone of the East Pacific, the area with the longest ice coverage has declined by 123,533 km(2) over the past four decades. Our assessment of chlorophyll-a and SST highlights that the area of "good" habitat for krill has increased in the high-latitude zone, but decreased in the polar zone close to the continent in all sectors other than the East Pacific, where the reverse has been true. These examples demonstrate how our general approach can visualise and identify (i) known trends in mean values but also diagnose where changes in the habitat area over time may not match the mean trend; (ii) key habitat thresholds across a range of variables and in different seasons; and (iii) changes in the degree of spatial overlap of areas with desirable ranges for different habitat components. Our approach provides a versatile method to generate summaries of status and trends of ocean habitats at scales meaningful to decision makers. It can readily be adapted to other habitat variables and for other areas, supporting ongoing efforts to assess status and trends of open ocean habitats worldwide.

Flexible foraging strategies of gentoo penguins Pygoscelis papua over 5 years in the South Shetland Islands, Antarctica	MARINE BIOLOGY												Gentoo penguins Pygoscelis papua show considerable plasticity in their diet, diving, and foraging behaviors among colonies; we expected that they might exhibit similar variability over time, at a single site, since flexible foraging habits would provide a buffer against changes in prey availability. We examined interannual changes in the foraging strategies and diet of gentoo penguins in the South Shetland Islands, Antarctica, over 5 years with variable prey abundance. Antarctic krill Euphausia superba was the primary diet item, and fish the secondary, though the importance of these items varied among years. Diving behavior also varied over time: different dive depth distributions were observed among years. Nonetheless, chick-rearing success remained relatively constant, indicating that gentoo penguins were able to maintain chick provisioning by altering their foraging strategy among years. Variable abundance of krill in the region did not have observable impacts on the diet, foraging behaviors or chick-rearing success of gentoo penguins. We suggest that foraging plasticity may be one reason that gentoo penguin populations have remained stable in the region, while their congeners (P. antarctica and P. adeliae) with less flexible foraging strategies have declined.																	0025-3162	1432-1793				NOV	2009	156	12					2527	2537		10.1007/s00227-009-1277-z							WOS:000270721000010

Of particular interest was the positional distribution of the polyunsaturated n-3 fatty acids in milk triacylglycerols (TG). In adipocytes of pinnipeds, TG are synthesized with the n-3 fatty acids primarily in the sn-1,3 positions. To determine the positional distribution, extracts of enzymatically digested lipids were separated by thin-layer chromatography, and the constituent fatty acids were separated and quantified by gas-liquid chromatography. Monoenoic and saturated fatty acids comprised over 75% of the total, the ratio of monoenoic to saturated fatty acids being 2:1. The percent content of the long-chain n-3 fatty acids, 20:5, 22:5 and 22:6, ranged between 15-20%. The positional analyses revealed that at the sn-2 position of milk TG, saturated fatty acids were in excess (57%), and the content of n-3 fatty acids was less than 5%. More than 80% of the n-3 fatty acids in milk were located in the sn-1,3 positions. The data indicate that in pinnipeds TG are synthesized in the mammary gland and adipose tissue with fatty acids having similar positional distributions.

Antarctic seals: Molecular biomarkers as indicators for pollutant exposure, health effects and diet	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Weddell (Leptonychotes weddellii), Ross (Ommatophoca rossii) and crabeater seals (Lobodon carcinophaga) are phocid seals with a circumpolar distribution around Antarctica. As long-lived and large top predators, they bioaccumulate contaminants and are considered as sentinels of ecosystem health. Antarctic seals are increasingly exposed to climate change, pollution, shipping and fisheries. To reveal and understand possible anthropogenic impacts on their immune and health status, this study investigates sensitive biomarkers of the xenobiotic metabolism and immune system in relation to mercury (Hg) burden. Gene-transcription studies using minimally invasive blood samples are useful to monitor physiological processes in wildlife that can be related to different stressors. Blood samples of 72 wild-caught seals (Weddell n = 33; Ross n = 12; crabeater n = 27) in the Amundsen and Ross Seas in 2008-2011 were investigated. Copy numbers per mu l mRNA transcription of xenobiotic biomarkers (aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR)), aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator (ARNT) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR alpha) and immune relevant cell mediators (cytokines interleukin-2 (IL-2), interleukin-10 (IL-10) and heat-shock-protein 70 (HSP70)) were measured using reference genes Tyrosine 3-monooxygenase/tryptophan 5-monooxygenase activation protein, zeta polypeptide (YWHAZ) and ribosomal protein L4 (RPL4) by real time RT-qPCR. Hg concentration was analysed in fur. Hg concentration increased with body weight and standard length in all species. Crabeater seals showed a lower Hg concentration than Ross and Weddell seals. Species-specific differences in gene-transcription were found between all species with highest levels of AHR, ARNT and PPARa in crabeater seals. Ross seals showed highest IL-10 and HSP70 transcription, while HSP70 was exceptionally low in crabeater seals. Between Hg and HSP70 a clear negative relationship was found in all species. The species-specific, age and sex-dependent gene-transcription probably reflect dietary habits, pollutant exposure and immune status. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier B.V.

Time- and sex-specific annual variation in adult survival was estimated using capture-mark-recapture of petrels nesting at Petrels Island, Terre Adelie, 1981-1997. On the basis of a regression analysis, 44% of the variation was linked inversely to the latitudinal extent of sea-ice during winter (June) in the region offshore of the study colony, where this population is likely to spend the non-breeding season. Monthly sea-surface temperature anomalies tended to influence adult survival but the relationship was not statistically significant. Why sea-ice extent should have such a critical effect on this species is yet to be explained, but the relationship, in the context of environmental warming and the consequent potential loss of Antarctic sea-ice, is an important one for this species.

Haul-out pattern of itinerant male Antarctic fur seals (Arctocephalus gazella) at Laurie Island, South Orkney Islands	POLAR RESEARCH												The seasonal haul-out pattern of itinerant male Antarctic fur seals (Arctocephalus gazella) was determined by regular Counts at Mossman Peninsula, Laurie Island, South Orkney Islands, from 1996 to 2005. Small numbers of animals began to arrive at the beach in late December/early January (mean date 28 December +/- 15 days, n = 10). Peak numbers of animals ashore changed considerably between seasons. In 1996. 1998 and 2001, peak numbers were registered in March (6/3, 18/3) and 6/3, respectively). Numbers peaked in 1997, 1999 and 2005 at the end of January/beginning of February (26/1, 2/2 and 28/1. respectively). In 2000 2002, 2003) and 2004 peaks were registered in the third week of February (15/2, 22/2 14/2 and 20/2, respectively). Peaks In numbers of seals ashore also varied between years, being minimum during 2001 (2531 individuals) and maximum during 2006 (16610 individuals). In March 1998 the coasts of Laurie Island were Surveyed by navigating inflatable boats near the shoreline; 18 haul-out places were identified. The big differences in peak numbers, as well as in the dates of peak events among years, Suggest that local conditions could have all effect oil the numbers of animals hauled out in a given year. It may therefore be difficult to predict trends from summer censuses in non-breeding places.																	0800-0395						2006	25	2					139	144		10.1111/j.1751-8369.2006.tb00029.x							WOS:000238877400004

The southern elephant seal (Mirounga leonina) consumes large quantities of fish and squid prey in the Southern Ocean relative to other marine mammals; however, how diet varies relative to seasonal and spatial foraging behaviour is unknown. We used fatty acid (FA) signature analysis of 63 blubber cores from adult female M. leonina over three seasons (winter 1999, summer 2000 and winter 2001) to determine diet structure. We detected significant differences between seasons and between the main foraging regions (Antarctic continental shelf versus pelagic). We used the FA profiles from 53 fish, squid and krill species to construct a discriminant function that would classify each seal, from its blubber sample as having a fish- or squid-FA profile. We determined that a higher proportion of M. leonina had fish-dominated diets during the winter and when foraging around the Antarctic continental shelf, and the majority had more squid-dominated diets during the summer when foraging pelagically. Thus, we were able to measure the coarse-scale diet structure of a major marine predator using FA profiles, and estimate its associated seasonal and temporal variation.

J	Constable, AJ				Constable, AJ			Managing fisheries effects on marine food webs in Antarctica: Trade-offs among harvest strategies, monitoring, and assessment in achieving conservation objectives	BULLETIN OF MARINE SCIENCE					4th International Symposium in Fisheries Ecology	NOV 05-07, 2002	Mote Marine Lab, Sarasota, FL	William R & Lenore Mote Endowment, Florida State Univ	Mote Marine Lab			Harvesting of marine living resources in the Southern Ocean is managed by the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR), which is widely known for its ecosystem approach to managing fisheries and inclusion of food-web maintenance in the conservation objectives. CCAMLR has developed a precautionary approach to account for predators when setting catch limits for krill, the most important prey species in the Antarctic marine ecosystem. It has also established an ecosystem monitoring program to help detect effects of prey harvesting on predators. CCAMLR's approach is intended to permit both recovery of overexploited species and ecologically sustainable development of fisheries without causing damage to the Antarctic marine ecosystem. The trade-offs are between the harvest strategies (catches) and the ability to obtain sufficient information and knowledge for management of fisheries in a way that achieves the conservation objectives. This paper presents general principles of an ecosystem-based approach to fisheries using the CCAMLR approaches as examples. It discusses the precautionary and ecosystem approaches of CCAMLR, the types of objectives being considered for predators, and the general approaches and monitoring programs that could achieve ecosystem/food web conservation objectives.																	0007-4977					MAY	2004	74	3					583	605									WOS:000223283600008

Three communities were defined based on routine trawls. The Main Oceanic Community comprising herbivorous copepods, chaetognaths, and the euphausiid Thysanoessa macrura dominated the area west of 120 degrees E. The area east of 120 degrees E was dominated by Salpa thompsoni. The third community located in the neritic zone was dominated by Euphausia crystallorophias. Antarctic krill Euphausia superba did not form a distinct community in its own right, unlike previous observations in Prydz Bay. Krill were distributed throughout most of the survey area but generally in higher abundances towards the shelf break. Overall, krill abundance was low compared with previous net surveys in Prydz Bay. Three main types of assemblages were identified based on target trawls. The first group was dominated by krill (mean 1149 individuals per 1000 m(3)) which represented > 99% of Group 1 catches in terms of numbers and biomass. Group 2 comprised the bulk of target trawls and comprised a wide diversity of species typical of the main oceanic community, with a mean abundance approximately half of that observed in the routine trawls. The third group comprised trawls in the neritic zone dominated by E. crystallorophias. No salp-dominated aggregation was found. While E. superba did not dominate a distinct community geographically as seen in previous Prydz Bay surveys, it did dominate discrete layers or aggregations, showing that both horizontal and vertical separation of communities exist.

We examine this suggestion and conclude that, in fact, there has been considerable research effort into ecosystem interactions over the last 25 years, particularly through research associated with management of the living resources of the Southern Ocean.

Results from 34 birds showed that foraging penguins with eggs and with brooded and creching chicks spent mean periods away from the nest of 96, 36 and 21 h, respectively, during which time means of 29.0 h (30%), 11.2 h (31%) and 2.7 h (13%), respectively, were spent under water at depths > 5 m. Time under water was positively correlated with time absent from nest. Maximum depth reached was 170 m but overall birds spent most time at shallower depths. Birds foraging for brooded chicks dived deeper than birds foraging for creching chicks. Stomach-pumping indicated that the principal prey caught at this time was krill, Euphausia superba. Mean mass changes of adults during single foraging trips indicated that krill were caught at a mean rate of 7.2 g min-1 spent under water.																	0025-3162						1991	109	2					181	189		10.1007/BF01319385							WOS:A1991FT43700001

Using a weak acid extraction method to dissolve organic material and leach associated but not constitutive trace elements of sediments, fifteen elements were measured from seafloor sediment, seawater particulates, and tissues of benthic (bivalves, brittlestars, sea urchins) and pelagic (demersal and pelagic fishes, krill) organisms collected in the flooded caldera. The highest element concentrations were associated with scafloor sediment, the lowest with seawater particulates and organism tissues. In the case of Ag and Se, concentrations were highest in organism tissue, indicating contamination through the food chain and biomagnification of those elements. The elements Al, Fe, Mn, Sr, Ti, and to a lesser extent Zn, were the most concentrated of the trace elements for all sample types. This indicates that the whole ecosystem of Deception Island is contaminated with trace elements from local geothermal activity, which is also reflected in the pattern of element contamination in organisms. Accordingly, element concentrations were higher in organisms collected at Deception Island compared to those from the neighboring non-active volcanic King George Island, suggesting that volcanic activity enhances bioavailability of trace elements to marine organisms.

J	Kock, KH; Reid, K; Croxall, J; Nicol, S				Kock, Karl-Hermann; Reid, Keith; Croxall, John; Nicol, Stephen			Fisheries in the Southern Ocean: an ecosystem approach	PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES												The Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR) is bound by its Article II, 3 to follow an ecosystem approach to management. This approach has been extended to the application of a precautionary approach in the late 1980s. In our review, we deal primarily with the science-related aspects of CCAMLR and its development towards an ecosystem approach to the management of the living resources of the Southern Ocean. To assist the Commission in meeting its objectives, as set out in Article II, 3, the Scientific Committee established the CCAMLR Ecosystem Monitoring Programme to detect possible effects of krill fishing on the performance of top-level predators, such as albatrosses, penguins, petrels and fur seals. Fisheries in the Southern Ocean followed the fate of other fisheries worldwide in which target species were depleted to low level one after the other. Currently, two types of fisheries are open: the longline fisheries on Patagonian toothfish (Dissostichus eleginoides) and Antarctic toothfish (Dissostichus mawsoni) and the trawl fisheries on mackerel icefish (Champsocephalus gunnari). Both fisheries are managed in a single-species context, however, with conservation measures in place to protect by-catch species, such as rattails (Macrouridae) and skates and rays (Rajidae). Two major problems still exist in fisheries in the Southern Ocean: the by-catch of birds in longline fisheries primarily in the Indian Ocean and the high level of IUU fishing again in the Indian Ocean. Both, the by-catch of birds and high IUU catches undermine the credibility of CCAMLR to safeguard the marine living resources in the Southern Ocean.																	0962-8436	1471-2970				DEC 29	2007	362	1488					2333	2349		10.1098/rstb.2006.1954							WOS:000250644100010	17553767

Euphausiids constituted on average 96% by mass, while fish contributed 4% by mass. Amphipods were present in small amounts. Antarctic krill Euphausia superba was the predominant component throughout the sampling period. In contrast, Euphausia crystallorophias occurred rarely. Differences in the size of krill taken by Adelie penguins appear to reflect either local changes in the availability of certain age classes at various times in the breeding season, or differences in foraging areas, or are due to year-to-year differences in prey availability and abundance, possibly caused by variations in seasonal ice cover. Pleuragramma antarcticum constituted the bulk of the fish portion, particularly during the guard period.																	0722-4060					JUL	1995	15	6					415	418									WOS:A1995RJ23800004						
J	Daly, KL; Zimmerman, JJ				Daly, KL; Zimmerman, JJ			Comparisons of morphology and neritic distributions of Euphausia crystallorophias and Euphausia superba furcilia during autumn and winter west of the Antarctic Peninsula	POLAR BIOLOGY												Euphausia crystallorophias and E. superba larvae often overlap in distribution in Antarctic coastal regions. Here, we describe the morphology and ecology of E. crystallorophias furcilia stages F3-F6,. with emphasis on characteristics that distinguish them from E. superba, based on samples collected west of the Antarctic Peninsula during autumn and winter 2001 and 2002. During autumn most E. crystallorophias occurred as F4s (53%) and F5s (35%), while E. superba occurred in all furcilia stages (F1-F6). During winter, F6 was the dominant stage (>67%) for both species. On average, body lengths of E. crystallorophias larval stages were significantly greater than those of E. superba. During autumn, densities of the two species were similar (range: 0.003-11.8 m(-3)) at many on-shelf stations, with lower densities during winter. Where both species occurred, > 58% of E. crystallorophias furcilia were collected between 50 and 100 m depth, while 82% of E. superba were shallower (25-50 m). Younger stages of E. crystallorophias occurred more frequently (54% of F3s) in water > 100 m than older stages (11% of F6s). Thus, many larval E. crystallorophias were vertically segregated from E. superba, thereby reducing grazing competition between the young of these morphologically similar species.																	0722-4060					DEC	2004	28	1					72	81		10.1007/s00300-004-0660-y							WOS:000226552800008						
J	Voronina, NM; Maslennikov, VV; Rat'kova, TN				Voronina, NM; Maslennikov, VV; Rat'kova, TN			Changes in the structure of antarctic plankton in the regions of mass development of salps	OCEANOLOGY												The spatial structure of plankton in the Pacific sector of the Antarctic was studied in the region of a giant swarm of salps. In February-March 1992, the studies were carried out at eight stations of the section along 67 degrees S between 106 degrees 50' and 175 degrees 37'W. The taxonomic composition and biomass of the phytoplankton in the layer of 0-200 in and of the zooplankton filter feeders (Copepoda, Euphausiida, and Salpa) in the depth range 0-1500 in were studied. Three types of structures different in their total abundances were distinguished in the study basin, and the relations between the main components were examined. The first type was characteristic of the stations forming the background area. It was characterized by a moderate development of phytoplankton (220 g/m(2)) and the domination of copepods, which represented 90% of the zooplankton biomass in wet weight on the average. Euphausiids were scarce as everywhere (3.2%). Salps were found only occasionally. The structure of the second type was characteristic of the salp region located in the middle of the section, which crossed the frontal zone and was the structure of the third type. Both latter structures were characterized by mass development of salps, which represented 99 and 96% of the biomass, respectively. The differences between them were in the extremely low content of phytoplankton at the stations of the second structure (45 g/m2) and its maximum (270 g/m2) in the third structure. The ratio of the biomasses of the phytoplankton and zooplankton in the three sites was 15 : 0.06 : 1, respectively. It was shown that the aggregation of salps was represented by two foci of increased biomass. The former was related to the eastern branch of the Ross Gyre, while the latter was associated with the western branch of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current. An upwelling of the deep water occurs between them. The stations rich in salps are characterized by the highest temperatures of the deep water (T,,,a,,). This temperature is an indicator of its inflow. The described diversity of the plankton distribution is determined by two main factors: the increased advection of salps, on the one hand, and the eating up of the phytoplankton by salps, which undermines the food resources of copepods, on the other hand. The annual secondary production of zooplankton was calculated for different parts of the section, which, after conversion to carbon units, appeared very similar in the regions of the copepod and salp domination of the section. The possibility of conserving the described composition of plankton in the future is discussed.																	0001-4370	1531-8508				MAY-JUN	2005	45	3					368	375									WOS:000230931700009						
J	Hegseth, EN; Von Quillfeldt, CH				Hegseth, EN; Von Quillfeldt, CH			Low phytoplankton biomass and ice algal blooms in the Weddell Sea during the ice-filled summer of 1997	ANTARCTIC SCIENCE												The summer of 1997 was characterized by unusually large amounts of pack ice in the southeastern Weddell Sea, and less than 10% of the area that is commonly ice-free in summer was open. A modest phytoplankton bloom developed in the upper mixed layer in the northernmost area (72degreesS). The bloom peaked in mid-February with max chlorophyll concentrations of 1.5 mug l(-1), and integrated stocks of 55-60 mg m(-2). Autotrophic flagellates dominated the biomass (80-90% of the chlorophyll) at first, while diatoms increased relative to flagellates during the bloom. Nutrient deficits, however, indicated that a much larger biomass was produced than was observed. Freezing starting after mid-February probably terminated the bloom, resulting in a pelagic growth season limited in time (less than two months) and space. The sea ice had a distinct brown layer of algae, usually at 1-2 m depth, with average chlorophyll biomass of 10.3 mg m(-2). The ice cover exhibited a substantial amount of ridges, with ice algae growing in cavities and other structures, but with lower biomass than in the bands. Ice algae were also found growing on the lower 2 m of the ice shelf (visible at low tide). The overall growth season in the ice lasted several months, and ice algal production may have exceeded pelagic production in the Weddell Sea during the growth season of 1997. Pennate diatoms, like Fragilariopsis curta and F. cylindrus, dominated both in ice and in open water above the pycnocline, while Phaeocystis antarctica dominated in deeper layers and in crack pools. Euphausiids, particularly young stages, were frequently observed grazing on ice algae in ridges and on all sides of the floes, (confirmed by the gut content). Ice algae would thus have served as an ample food supply for the krill in the summer of 1997.																	0954-1020	1365-2079				SEP	2002	14	3					231	243		10.1017/S095410200200007X							WOS:000181092800006

J	Southwell, CJ; Kerry, KR; Ensor, PH				Southwell, CJ; Kerry, KR; Ensor, PH			Predicting the distribution of crabeater seals Lobodon carcinophaga off east Antarctica during the breeding season	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												Predictive species-environment models have numerous ecological and management applications, and can provide insight into the functional relationships between a species and its environment. Generalised linear models were used to develop predictive models of crabeater seal Lobodon carcinophaga distribution during the breeding season in relation to physical-oceanographic and ice-cover variables. Models were constructed from data collected on shipboard surveys in the pack-ice off east Antarctica between 50 and 115 degrees E from 1985 to 1987, and were tested from surveys in the same region from 1995 to 1997. Models of presence selected ocean depth as the only significant physical-oceanographic predictor variable for both breeding and non-breeding seals. Seals were most likely to be present on the ice at moderate ocean depths of approximately 2500 m. Unlike non-breeding seals, breeding seals were all but absent on the ice associated with depths of > 4000 m. The predicted distribution of presence comprised a band delineated by the shelf-break to the south and extending northwards for 1.5 to 5 degrees latitude, with non-breeding seals having a more northerly limit than breeding seals. This band is coincident with the known distribution of the crabeater seals' primary food source (Antarctic krill), and also coincides with frontal features such as the Antarctic slope front and the southern boundary of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current, which are considered to be areas of enhanced primary and secondary productivity. The presence-depth models were improved by the inclusion of ice-cover variables. Breeding seals may avoid areas with a high proportion of all ice as floes < 20 m in size, because the chance of successfully weaning a pup in such areas is low.																	0171-8630	1616-1599					2005	299						297	309		10.3354/meps299297							WOS:000232469700027

Blood fatty acids indicate inter- and intra-annual variation in the diet of Adelie penguins: Comparison with stomach content and stable isotope analysis	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY												Adelie penguin (Pygoscelis adeliae) diet is an important indicator of prevailing environmental conditions and resource availability. In this study, dietary variation within and between years was studied with fatty acid signature analysis (FASA), stomach content analysis (SCA) and stable isotope analysis (SIA). We profiled the fatty acid (FA) composition of whole blood collected from adult penguins throughout the breeding season, and from chicks during the crehe period, in 2001 and 2002. Differences were detected in FA profiles between years, breeding stage and age (adults vs. chicks). These patterns broadly corresponded to those observed from SCA and SIA, with a mix of krill and fish consumed in the early part of the breeding season in both years, krill dominating the diet during the chick-rearing periods in 2001, and fish in 2002. Different metabolic and physiological demands between stages, and ages, may also influence FA profiles but warrants further investigation. In-situ calibrations of adult FA blood profiles were made using corresponding stomach samples to quantify diet composition. Using linear discriminate function analysis, we classified adult FA profiles into 3 meal-types: krill, fish or mixed. A higher proportion of adults had fish-like profiles during the arrival and guard periods. Krill-like profiles dominated during the incubation and crehe periods, although there were a relatively high proportion of fish-like and mixed profiles as well. These patterns corresponded to results from SCA and SIA. This study demonstrates that FASA has the potential to be integrated with other dietary tools to enhance diet monitoring studies, which are currently integral to ecosystem management and conservation measures. The in-situ calibration method used offers a simple and effective alternative to more rigorous calibration techniques developed elsewhere. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	LU, CC; WILLIAMS, R				LU, CC; WILLIAMS, R			CONTRIBUTION TO THE BIOLOGY OF SQUID IN THE PRYDZ BAY-REGION, ANTARCTICA	ANTARCTIC SCIENCE												The teuthoid fauna of the Prydz Bay region of the Southern Ocean (Indian Ocean sector) has been studied based on the material collected from 1981-1991 using a rectangular midwater trawl (RMT-8), pelagic trawl (IYGPT), and bottom trawl. Eight species of squid have been recognized: Brachioteuthis sp., Kondakovia longimana, Bathyteuthis abyssicola, Psychroteuthis glacialis, Alluroteuthis antarcticus, Mastigoteuthis psychrophila, Mesonychoteuthis hamiltoni and Galiteuthis glacialis. Size frequency distribution, geographical and vertical distributions of each species as well as diets of common species are analysed. There is no evidence of a diel vertical migration but ontogenetic descent appears to occur in P. glacialis and G. glacialis. Antarctic krill, Euphausia superba and the Antarctic silverfish, Pleuragramma antarcticum are important prey for most species with cannibalism occurring in P. glacialis, A. antarcticus and M. hamiltoni. Equations for calculating total weight from mantle length, and mantle length and total weight from upper and lower rostral length are provided for B. abyssicola, P. glacialis, A. antarcticus, M. psychrophila, and G. glacialis.																	0954-1020	1365-2079				JUN	1994	6	2					223	229		10.1017/S0954102094000349							WOS:A1994NP43700017
