Toward understanding krill's response to environmental change, it is necessary to identify regions that support high krill larval production (spawning habitat). We develop a mechanistic model combining thermal and food requirements for krill egg production, with predation pressure post-spawning, to predict regions of high-quality spawning habitat. We optimize our model regionally and generate circumpolar predictions of spawning habitat quality. Our results indicate the southwest Atlantic accounts for almost half of all predicted high-quality spawning habitat. Small-scale management units (SSMUs) around the Antarctic Peninsula had high coverage of high-quality spawning habitat. In contrast, the remaining SSMUs (except around South Georgia) were poorly covered, suggestive of population sinks reliant on input from external sources upstream. This implies strong potential for downstream impacts of fishing in key spawning areas, with implications for management of SSMUs and the krill fishery. © 2021. American Geophysical Union.

We measured a number of morphological features to identify differences between, and within, these species to obtain ecological insights. Interspecifically, the greatest difference was carapace size, with that of E. superba being by far the largest and most variable. This likely reflects its prolific spawning capacity compared with other euphausiid species. E. triacantha exhibited an extended sixth abdominal segment that could facilitate greater levels of thrust in the tail flip escape response. The pleopods, which provide propulsion in forward swimming, were more than 50% larger in E. superba, indicating a greater capacity for directional movement at high velocities. E. crystallorophias had eyes that were almost double the size of those in E. superba and E. triacantha, which may help retain visual resolution within its under-ice habitat. Intraspecifically, we found the above morphological features differed little between sexes and developmental stages in E. crystallorophias and E. triacantha, but differed significantly in E. superba. Compared to females and juveniles, male E. superba had significantly larger eyes and pleopods, whilst the carapace in males became shorter as a proportion of body length during growth. These features indicate a greater capacity for searching and swimming in males, which, we hypothesise, increases their ability to locate and fertilise females. This morphological specialisation in male E. superba is indicative of comparatively greater inter-male competition resulting from its tendency to form large, dense swarms. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",2-s2.0-85094979023

Few winter studies exist from which to infer impacts of changing environmental conditions on the biology of krill. Here demographic and maturity patterns of krill during five winters are examined at an overwintering hotspot in the northern Antarctic Peninsula. Two different recruitment pulses were present over the 5 years of the study. A large recruitment event was evident in winter 2012, followed by cohort growth tracked through winter 2014. A recruitment event also occurred in 2015, despite lower abundance of larvae in 2013 and 2014. The recruitment pulse in 2015 was correlated with the intrusion of high salinity water, characteristic of the Weddell Sea, during a positive El Niño–Southern Oscillation phase, suggesting recruitment was driven by advection of recruits into the northern Antarctic Peninsula. Despite the inter-annual environmental variability, most female krill were in resting reproductive stages in all years. The lack of variability in female reproductive status during winter may impose a developmental constraint to earlier spawning than previously considered; the time necessary to advance from resting stages to reproductive maturity may limit the ability of krill to adapt to trends in the timing and magnitude of the spring bloom. The observed patterns of recruitment and variation in maturity stages highlight the complexity of krill population dynamics and should be considered when projecting population responses of Antarctic krill to climate-driven changes in the Southern Ocean. © 2020, This is a U.S. Government work and not under copyright protection in the US; foreign copyright protection may apply.",2-s2.0-85089187421

Successful embryonic development and hatching are key to their life cycle, but despite the rapid climatic warming seen across their main spawning areas, the effects of elevated temperatures on embryogenesis, hatching success, and nauplii malformations are unknown. We incubated 24,483 krill embryos in two independent experiments to investigate the hypothesis that temperatures exceeding 1.5°C have a negative impact on hatching success and increase the numbers of malformed nauplii. Field experiments were on krill collected from near the northern, warm limit of their range and embryos incubated soon after capture, while laboratory experiments were on embryos from krill acclimated to laboratory conditions. The hatching success of embryo batches varied enormously, from 0 to 98% (mean 27%). Both field and laboratory experiments showed that hatching success decreased markedly above 3.0°C. Our field experiments also showed an approximate doubling of the percentage of malformed nauplii at elevated temperatures, reaching 50% at 5.0°C. At 3.0°C or below, however, temperature was not the main factor driving the large variation in embryo hatching success. Our observations of highly variable and often low success of hatching to healthy nauplii suggest that indices of reproductive potential of female krill relate poorly to the subsequent production of viable krill larvae and may help to explain spatial discrepancies between the distribution of the spawning stock and larval distribution. © Copyright © 2020 Perry, Kawaguchi, Atkinson, Sailley, Tarling, Mayor, Lucas, King and Cooper.",2-s2.0-85087501321

Model data were from the international krill fishery and U.S. AMLR surveys in the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR) Subarea 48.1, the area around the Antarctic peninsula where the majority of recent fishing for krill has taken place. Sensitivity tests using pre-specified values for the standard deviation of the logarithm of annual recruitment residuals (σR) and productivity (steepness, h) for the relationship between spawning biomass and subsequent recruitment indicated that neither the Beverton-Holt nor Ricker functions were superior to configurations of the model that did not assume a spawner-recruit relationship. As the predictive power of the spawner-recruit functions was reduced by increasing the value of σR the fit to the data improved. All the functions fitted the data best when σR was large enough so that random recruitment with respect to spawning biomass was produced. The alternative functions produced the same time series of recruitment and spawning biomass estimates when they were determined by the data rather than forced towards an assumed relationship. Although the Beverton-Holt and Ricker models were poor predictors of the data, cross-correlations of the recruitment predictions with the spawning biomass predictions from the best models indicated that recruitment was statistically correlated with spawning biomasses in the previous two to four years. The highest correlation (0.58) was with spawning biomass three years previously. Correlations in the reverse direction, with spawning biomass following recruitment were insignificant. These results suggest that recruitment variability does not influence subsequent spawning biomass in krill. They leave open the possibility that krill spawning biomass could influence subsequent recruitment, but not as modeled in the Beverton-Holt or Ricker functions with a one-year lag and the pre-specified von Bertalanffy growth. © 2018",2-s2.0-85054417670

The model was fitted to over forty years of fisheries and survey data for krill in Subarea 48.1, a statistical reporting area around the Antarctic Peninsula used by the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR). The number of estimated parameters was gradually increased across model configurations. Configurations that estimated more parameters fitted the data better, but the order in which the parameters were estimated became more important in finding the best fit. Twenty-two configurations estimating from 48 to 107 parameters were able to obtain an invertible Hessian matrix that was subsequently used to estimate parameter uncertainty. Parameter uncertainties calculated using asymptotic approximation around the maximum likelihood estimates were often larger than uncertainties based on Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling for the same parameters. Diagnostics applied to MCMC samples in the best model of each configuration that obtained an invertible Hessian indicated that the most highly parameterized configurations did not reach stationary distributions. A 96-parameter configuration was the best fitting model of those that passed the MCMC diagnostics. The ?AIC and ?BIC scores indicated essentially no support relative to the best model for the alternative models that also passed MCMC diagnostics. Simulated data using the configurations as operating models showed that while all configurations passed ""self-tests"" for spawning biomass and recruitment, there was a small negative bias due to model penalties in the fishing mortality estimates for years with the highest fishing mortalities.

Within this sector, our first goal was to produce quantitative distribution maps of all six ontogenetic life stages of krill (eggs, nauplii plus metanauplii, calyptopes, furcilia, juveniles, and adults), based on a compilation of all available post 1970s data. Using these maps, we then examined firstly whether “hotspots” of egg production and early stage nursery occurred, and secondly whether the available habitat was partitioned between the successive life stages during the austral summer and autumn, when krill densities can be high. To address these questions, we compiled larval krill density records and extracted data spanning 41 years (1976–2016) from the existing KRILLBASE-abundance and KRILLBASE-length-frequency databases. Although adult males and females of spawning age were widely distributed, the distribution of eggs, nauplii and metanauplii indicates that spawning is most intense over the shelf and shelf slope. This contrasts with the distributions of calyptope and furcilia larvae, which were concentrated further offshore, mainly in the Southern Scotia Sea. Juveniles, however, were strongly concentrated over shelves along the Scotia Arc. Simple environmental analyses based on water depth and mean water temperature suggest that krill associate with different habitats over the course of their life cycle. From the early to late part of the austral season, juvenile distribution moves from ocean to shelf, opposite in direction to that for adults. Such habitat partitioning may reduce intraspecific competition for food, which has been suggested to occur when densities are exceptionally high during years of strong recruitment. It also prevents any potential cannibalism by adults on younger stages. Understanding the location of krill spawning and juvenile development in relation to potentially overlapping fishing activities is needed to protect the health of the south-west Atlantic sector ecosystem. © 2019 Perry et al.

We consider the importance of a range of recruitment factors using an environmentally driven model of larval development from spawning to post-larvae. Our model examines the timing of spawning, interaction with bathymetry, susceptibility to cold temperatures, temperature-driven development and the seasonal cycle of sea ice to identify those factors with the greatest impact. The model predicts that the seasonal location of sea ice is the main limiting factor for successful larval recruitment. Spawning in January leads to the greatest area of viable larval recruitment habitat. Dense sea ice cover, which we assume that adult krill do not spawn under, prevents spawning in large areas early in the breeding season (December). Nevertheless, later spawning in February, when sea ice is at a minimum, means there is often insufficient time for the larvae to reach a viable developmental stage before the sea ice advances. Meanwhile, although spawning is possible in more northerly areas throughout the breeding season, these are generally remote from winter sea ice, which is assumed to be necessary for larvae to overwinter. Interaction with bathymetry before hatching further limits suitable habitat. Over a 12 yr period, the model predicted larval re - cruitment from January spawning in all years in the Cooperation, Ross and Weddell Seas, with episodic larval recruitment in the Bransfield Strait in 9 of the 12 years. Additional understanding of the overwintering requirements of larvae, together with regional studies at higher spatial resolution, particularly in shelf regions, will better constrain the uncertainties in the model. © 2019 Inter-Research.

The objective of this study was to determine whether these differing distributions result primarily from differences in spawning locations, larval development times, and transport by the Ross Sea circulation. To address this objective, Lagrangian particle tracking experiments were used to simulate the transport of larvae of Antarctic krill and crystal krill. The particle simulations showed that regions providing inputs of Antarctic krill to the Ross Sea were along the outer shelf/slope. Crystal krill transport and retention were along the shallow banks on the outer Ross Sea shelf. Particles initialized in the inner shelf off Victoria Land showed high retention in the region south and along the Terra Nova Bay polynya, with timescales consistent with development times of crystal krill. These results suggest that the cyclonic circulation over the shelf contributes significantly to the dispersion and retention of crystal krill in parts of the inner Ross Sea continental shelf that overlaps with regions with high concentrations of krill-dependent top predators. The westward circulation along the shelf break contributes to the transport and aggregation of Antarctic krill in regions where Circumpolar Deep Water is observed on the outer continental shelf and along the shelf break.

Sixteen model configurations using different combinations of the two biomass surveys with the various options for modeling selectivities were examined. Parameters were estimated in phases with the sequential order of the phases randomized until an invertible Hessian matrix was obtained. Model consistency for the estimates of derived quantities was tested using simulated data. Annual trends in the estimates of total biomass, spawning biomass, and recruitment were similar among different configurations assuming time-constant selectivity, but the absolute scaling ranged widely depending on which biomass indices were used.

Here, we apply a simplified model derived from this theory (DEBkiss) to Antarctic krill Euphausia superba. The model was parameterised using growth curves, and conversion factors for body composition and length-weight relationships. Subsequently, the model was used to predict a series of life-history traits (as function of body size) that were not used for parameterisation: instantaneous growth rates, ingestion and respiration rates, weight loss on starvation, and the number of eggs produced at spawning. Within the DEB framework, these traits are not intrinsic properties of the organism, but tightly coupled model outputs that depend on body size, life stage, and environmental conditions. Overall, the model predictions are consistent with the patterns in the (rather uncertain) observations, lending credence to the model assumptions underlying the DEBkiss model. More work is needed to fully elucidate the bioenergetics of the E. superba life cycle, but this analysis demonstrates how a dynamic budgeting framework can ensure consistency among the different life-history traits. Thereby, such models help in the interpretation of experimental results and the comparison of species, but can also form the basis for predicting population dynamics and the impacts of stressors. © Inter-Research 2015.",2-s2.0-84921905605

The transport and fate of the embryo and larva under present and modified conditions was investigated with Lagrangian particle tracking simulations. The two modeling studies were implemented using temperature and density (embryo-larva model) and circulation distributions (Lagrangian particle tracking) obtained from a high resolution version of the Regional Ocean Modeling System configured for the wAP shelf region. Additional simulations used temperature and circulation distributions obtained from simulations that were forced with increased wind speed and increased transport of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC), both projected to possibly occur with climate change in the wAP region. Simulations using present conditions showed that successful completion of the descent-ascent cycle occurred along the outer shelf and on the shelf in regions with bottom depths of 600-700. m. Estimated residence times for the shelf regions that support success of the embryo and larva were 20-30 days. Thus, krill spawned in the mid and inner shelf regions can be retained in these regions through development to the first feeding stage (calyptopis 1). Increased winds and ACC transport resulted in more onshelf transport of Circumpolar Deep Water (CDW), which increased the volume of warm (1-1.5. °C) water at depth. These conditions supported a moderate increase in success of the krill embryo and larva, but only for limited areas of the shelf where hatching depths decreased by 10-30. m (<5%) and development time to the calyptopis 1 stage decreased by 15-20%. The modified circulation conditions also supported increased advection of krill larvae into areas of the shelf that would experience the largest reduction of sea ice, especially in winter. Projected changes in wind strength and CDW transport may potentially enhance larval survival and advection onto the wAP shelf, but recruitment may be decreased by modifications to local sea ice distributions that would impede survival of Antarctic krill that overwinter on the shelf. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",2-s2.0-84883197741

Two survey areas were sampled focussed on Marguerite Bay in the south, and the tip of the Antarctic Peninsula in the north. Data from 177 stations showed that the highest concentrations of krill were found in the southern sampling area. Differences between areas were associated with a few large catches of one year old krill found in anomalously warm and productive waters in Marguerite Bay, and small krill catches in the less-productive, offshore waters in the north. Estimated krill density across the survey area was 3.4krillm-2, and was low compared to the long-term average of 45krillm-2 for the Elephant Island area. Overall recruitment between the two survey regions was similar, but per capita recruitment was about 60% lower than historical mean recruitment levels measured at Elephant Island since the late 1970s. Demographic patterns showed small krill concentrated near the coast, and large krill concentrated offshore on the shelf and slope all along the survey area. The offshore distribution of adult krill was delineated by the warm (~1°C), low salinity (33.8) water at 30m, suggesting that most krill were present shoreward of the southern boundary of Antarctic Circumpolar Current Front. Distributions of larvae indicated that three hotspot areas were important for the production of krill: slope areas outside Marguerite Bay and north of the South Shetland Islands, and near the coast around Antarctic Sound. Successful spawning, as inferred from larval abundance, was roughly coincident with the shelf break and not with inshore waters. Given the rapid changes in climate along the Antarctic Peninsula and the lower per capita recruitment observed in recent years, studies comparing and contrasting production, growth, and recruitment across the Peninsula will be critical to better understand how climate change will impact krill populations and their dependent predators in the Scotia Sea. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",2-s2.0-84878417362

The objective of our study was to evaluate these 2 mechanisms (remote and local inputs) and the consequences for wAP Antarctic krill populations. The relative effect of local versus remote connectivity was investigated using Lagrangian particle tracking experiments. Particles released in the Bellingshausen Sea were transported to the wAP shelf in 120 d, which is consistent with the time required for Antarctic krill eggs to develop into late-stage larvae. An estimated 23% of the particles released along the shelf break crossed the outer shelf and were transported to the mid and inner regions of the wAP shelf via 3 pathways that provide conduits for onshore intrusions of Circumpolar Deep Water (CDW). Of the particles that moved onto the wAP shelf, 54% were transported to inner shelf regions that are associated with areas of enhanced biological production. Of the particles at the outer shelf ~33% continued transport northeastward with the Antarctic Circumpolar Current. Particles released in the mid and inner shelf showed limited connectivity and low export from the shelf (<20%). The Lagrangian experiments indicate that Antarctic krill populations in the Marguerite Bay region of the wAP continental shelf are maintained by local and remote inputs of larvae.

The core data set consists of four RMT-net-sampling surveys that were conducted in early summer (December 2005 and 2007), autumn (April 2004) and winter (July to August 2006). Supplementary data were analysed from the 1980s to view the results in a wider geographical context. The major observations are the following: (1) krill abundance and distribution showed geographical, seasonal and interannual fluctuations. Krill abundance was almost one order of magnitude lower compared to the Southwest Atlantic. (2) Krill density showed substantial differences between day and night for autumn and winter surveys. (3) A spatial gradient was observed for krill size groups, with larger sized (adult spawning) krill further south and medium-sized juveniles and immatures mainly between 60° and 67°S. (4) Data on maturity stage composition and larvae occurrence indicate an active and successful spawning in these high-latitude areas even under the conditions of sea-ice cover. At the end of the spawning season, females and males regressed in their external sexual characteristics ('re-juvenation') to overwintering immature stages. Major conclusions relate to a conceptual view of the spatial distribution of krill size classes and the occurrence of larvae in the context of major oceanographic features and current systems in the Lazarev Sea and adjacent ocean sectors. The Lazarev Sea obviously does not support a single self-maintaining population, but represents a complex transition zone of stocks with different origins from the Scotia Sea and the Cosmonaut Sea. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.",2-s2.0-84864356636

However, direct observations during spring are rare. Here we studied krill body condition and maturity stage in relation to feeding (i.e. stomach fullness, diet, absorption of individual fatty acids and defecation rate) across the Scotia Sea in November 2006. The phytoplankton concentrations were low at the marginal ice zone (MIZ) in the southern Scotia Sea (Stn. 1, 2, and 3), high in open waters of the Southern Antarctic Circumpolar Current Front (SACCF) in the central Scotia Sea (Stn. 5), and moderate further north (Stn. 6 and 7). Krill had low lipid reserves (~6.5% of dry mass, DM), low mass:length ratios (~1.7mgDMmm -1), and small digestive glands (~7% of total DM) near the ice edge. The stomachs contained lithogenic particles, diatom debris, and bacterial fatty acids, but low proportions of diatom-indicating fatty acids, which suggest that these krill were feeding on detritus rather than on fresh ice algae. In the SACCF, krill had higher lipid reserves (~10% of DM), high mass:length ratios (~2.2mgDMmm -1), and large digestive glands (~16% of total DM). Stomach content and tissue composition indicate feeding on diatoms. In the north, moderate food concentrations co-occurred with low lipid reserves in krill, and moderate mass:length ratios and digestive gland sizes. Only in the phytoplankton bloom in the SACCF had the mating season already started and some females were about to spawn. Based on the way krill processed their food at the different stations, we indicate two mechanisms that can lead to fast regeneration of body reserves and oocyte maturation in E. superba. One is ""superfluous"" feeding at high food concentrations, which maximises the overall nutrient gain. The other is a preferential absorption of crucial fatty acids: 20:5(n-3) and 22:6(n-3) when regaining body condition after the winter, and 14:0 and 16:1(n-7) during accumulation of oocyte yolk. Multi-year time series of phytoplankton distribution show that an early spring bloom, as found in 2006, is not unusual for the central Scotia Sea and coincides with high krill larval concentrations in this area. In conclusion, the Scotia Sea is a main spawning ground of Antarctic krill and this is linked to phytoplankton blooms in open waters of the SACCF rather than to ice edge blooms. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.",2-s2.0-84855947024

Larval stages analyzed included: nauplius I, nauplius II, and metanauplius. Laboratory-reared embryos were spawned by gravid females incubated under three feeding groups: (1) phytoplankton mixture, (2) phytoplankton mixture and minced clam, and (3) phytoplankton mixture, minced clam, and commercial larval food. Hatching success was highest in group 3 (100%), lowest in group 1 (0%), and highly variable in field samples (0-48%). Lipid decreased slightly in embryos during embryonic development, while large decreases in lipid were found during nauplius development. High levels of 18:2(n-6), 20:4(n-6), and 22:6(n-3) observed with group 3 samples coincided with high hatching success in krill embryos. The ratio of 22:6(n-3)/20:5(n-3) also correlated to hatching success of embryos. The fatty acid profile of embryos in group 3 was similar to that of the field-collected embryos, reflecting the contribution of the commercial larval food in the maternal diet. In our study, the maternal diet was found to influence the fatty acid composition of embryos and in turn affects the hatching success of krill.

Collections were made throughout the WAP region during US GLOBEC cruises in austral fall, 2001 and 2002. A total of 585 E. superba (including all 6 furcilia larval stages, juveniles, and adults) was analyzed after confirmation of species identification using a competitive multiplexed species-specific PCR (SS-PCR) reaction based on mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I (mtCOI) sequences. The molecular markers used were allele frequencies at single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) sites in the gene encoding mitochondrial Cytochrome b (cyt b). Four SNP sites that showed desirable patterns of allelic variation were selected; alleles were detected using a multiplexed single-base extension PCR protocol. A total of 22 SNP haplotypes (i.e., strings of polymorphisms at the four SNP sites) was observed; haplotype diversity (Hd)=0.811 (s.d.=0.008). Analysis of molecular variation within and among samples, areas (i.e., Marguerite Bay, Crystal Sound, shelf, and offshore) and collection years revealed no difference between 2001 and 2002 collections overall, although differences between 2001 and 2002 collections from Marguerite Bay explained 7.4% of the variance (FST=0.072; p=0.002±0.001). Most of the variation (96.3%) occurred within samples each year, with no significant differentiation among areas. There was small, but significant differentiation among samples within areas in 2001 (4.6%; FST=0.045; p=0.015±0.003) and 2002 (6.3%; FST=0.062; p=0.000±0.000).

The significant differentiation among samples for E. superba within areas was interpreted as evidence of multiple sources of recruitment of E. superba in the WAP region, consistent with advective transport in observed circulation patterns and reproduction and spawning in both offshore and shelf habitats.

Interannual ecosystem variability in this region has long been recognized and thought related to El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events, but understanding of how has been limited by the hydrographic complexity of the region and lack of appropriate ocean-atmosphere interaction models. This study utilizes multidisciplinary data sets collected in the region from 1990 to 2004 by the U.S. Antarctic Living Marine Resources (AMLR) Program. We focus on hydrographic conditions associated with changes in the distribution, abundance and composition of salp- and copepod-dominated zooplankton assemblages during 1998 and 1999, years characterized respectively by a strong El Niño event and La Niña conditions. We provide detailed analyses of hydrographic, biological and ecological conditions during these dichotomous years in order to identify previously elusive oceanographic processes underlying ecosystem variability. We found that fluctuations between salp-dominated coastal zooplankton assemblages and copepod-dominated oceanic zooplankton assemblages result from the relative influence of Weddell Sea and oceanic waters and that these fluctuations are associated with latitudinal movement of the Southern Antarctic Circumpolar Current Front (sACCf). Latitudinal movements of the sACCf can be explained by meridional atmosphere teleconnections instigated in the western tropical Pacific Ocean by ENSO variability and are consistent with out-of-phase forcing in the South Pacific and South Atlantic Oceans by the Antarctic Dipole high-latitude climate mode. During El Niño decreased northwest winds, equatorward movement of the sACCf and an intensified Weddell Gyre allow Weddell Sea water to flow into eastern Bransfield Strait. During these periods mixing between oceanic and coastal waters is reduced, chlorophyll a concentrations are low, salps numerically dominate the zooplankton, and krill recruitment success is poor. During La Niña increased and more frequent northwest winds and poleward movement of the sACCf allows increased influence of oceanic waters and mixing of these with cold coastal waters. These periods are characterized by numerical dominance of copepods, elevated concentrations of oceanic zooplankton taxa and phytoplankton blooms that promote krill reproduction and recruitment success. Hydrographic and ecological changes after the 1998 El Niño are associated with a shift from frequent El Niños to the prevalence of La Niña and neutral conditions and conform to a decadal-scale climate regime shift in the Antarctic Peninsula region. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Lipid content as a function of sex/maturity stage and season was used to calculate the energy density of krill ingested by chicks. Simulations tested the influence of variability in krill size-class distribution, sex-ratio, length-at-maturity, and the timing of spawning on krill population energy density and penguin chick fledging mass. Of the parameters included in simulations, variability in the timing of krill spawning had the greatest influence on predicted Adélie penguin fledging mass, with fledging mass decreasing from 3.30 to 2.92 kg when peak spawning was shifted from early December to early March. Adélie penguin chicks that fledge from colonies along the western Antarctic Peninsula (wAP) and survive to recruit into the breeding population are 0.117 kg heavier than those that do not survive to breed. Thus, it appears that small differences in fledging mass potentially have significant implications for Adélie penguin chick survivorship. Therefore, the timing of krill spawning may have important consequences for Adélie penguins, and other top-predator species, that may time critical activities to coincide with a period of dependable prey availability with maximum energy density. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.",2-s2.0-77949656190

Studies have shown that seabird and prey distribution seldom conforms with this prediction. In this study, I review recent theoretical advances in spatial predator-prey interactions and relate these with studies of seabirds and pelagic schooling fish and crustaceans. Studies on seabirds and prey have generally assumed that prey are nonresponsive. Predator-prey interactions should, however, be viewed as a 2-way spatial game where seabirds track concentrations of prey while prey move away from areas with high risk of predation. The outcome of the game depends on how seabirds and prey are spatially constrained. Constraints include the spatial distribution of resources, interspecific competition, the location of spawning and breeding areas, and limitations on diving depth. Although game theoretic models can explain some general aspects of the spatial interaction, the spatial distribution of seabirds and prey is generally much more aggregated and elusive than can be expected from the game theoretic equilibrium. This is because spatial pattern is formed through selforganizing behavior that includes schooling, local enhancement and area-restricted search (ARS). Schooling and local enhancement are processes with strong positive density dependence that destabilize the predator-prey interaction locally. However, the unstable local dynamics might be stabilized by spatial constraints and the effects of ARS processes at large scales.",2-s2.0-70349762212

We examined this process in Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) in terms of the functioning of the female genital apparatus and associated swimming behaviour. A tethering technique combined with video analysis was used to make observations of three females during the release process. We found eggs were steadily extruded over a period of up to 10 h, during which time the krill released between 1,600 and 4,000 eggs and the ovary reduced by a half in length and a third in height. Eggs were mainly released individually or, less commonly, in batches of between 2 and 4 eggs. Release rates were between 5 and 30 eggs min-1. The steady release of eggs fits well with histological evidence that mature oocytes must pass individually through tight genital ducts with narrow apertures, before coming in to close contact with the sperm plug for fertilisation, and then expulsion from the thelycum as fertilised eggs. During spawning, the female alternated between slow and rapid rates of pleopod beating with egg release occurring at the moment of beat acceleration. At the point of release, the descent of the egg was accelerated through downward beats of the 7th thoracic leg. The cyclic pattern in pleopod beat-rate during spawning may alter swimming performance and contribute to the widely reported sex- and maturity-based biases within krill swarms. © Springer-Verlag 2009.",2-s2.0-70349849646

Climatology patterns showed that the Bellingshausen Sea and Marguerite Bay region usually had higher chlorophyll a concentrations, which persisted throughout austral spring and summer, compared with more northern regions along the Antarctic Peninsula and the western Scotia Sea. These predictable and long-lasting phytoplankton accumulations could provide krill with the food levels required for successful reproduction and larval survival. Unusually high krill reproduction in 2000/2001 was coincident with above-average chlorophyll a concentrations throughout most of the study area and resulted in the largest juvenile recruitment (in 2001/2002) since 1981. High larval densities (up to 132 ind m-3) at the shelf break along the Antarctic Peninsula may have resulted, in part, from krill spawning in the Bellingshausen Sea. In general, ice-edge blooms were only a significant feature in the southern sectors of our study area, particularly in the Bellingshausen Sea and, thus, may not support krill reproduction in the northern Peninsula region as previously believed. Instead, phytoplankton blooms during spring in the northern region appeared to be governed by shelf-break processes, such as upwelling of iron-rich deep water. Interannual differences in sea ice also probably contributed to the variability in larval krill abundances observed in Marguerite Bay. Sea ice melted early in 2000/2001, allowing elevated phytoplankton blooms to develop. In contrast, sea ice persisted throughout spring and summer 2001/2002 limiting phytoplankton accumulation, particularly in southern Marguerite Bay. Thus, the early and extended availability of elevated chlorophyll a concentrations during spring and summer 2000/2001, particularly in the vicinity of Marguerite Bay and to the south in the Bellingshausen Sea, as well as reduced sea ice in coastal areas, likely supported the unusually high densities of larval krill observed during fall in waters west of the Antarctic Peninsula. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

C. wilsoni has been exploited on a commercial scale from the late 1970s to the end of the 1980s off Joinville-D'Urville Islands (CCAMLR Statistical Subarea 48.1) and in the Cosmonauts and Cooperation Seas and Prydz Bay in the Indian Ocean sector (CCAMLR Statistical Division 58.4.2). This paper presents new information on biological features and life history characteristics of C. wilsoni, based on research survey collections along the northern Antarctic Peninsula in 2006 and 2007 and samples taken in the commercial fishery in 1987. Length frequency compositions from the research surveys demonstrated that fish 21-34 cm long predominated in the catches. Sexual maturity is attained at 24-25 cm. Absolute fecundity and relative fecundity is low (1,000-2,500 eggs; 6-12 eggs). Oocyte diameter varied from 4.0 to 4.9 mm very close to spawning. Spawning at the tip of the Antarctic Peninsula is likely to occur in October-November. Remotely operated vehicle deployments in the northern Weddell Sea demonstrated that C. wilsoni exhibit parental nest guarding where males protect the eggs. The incubation period is likely to be 8 months long. Fish feed primarily on Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) in the Antarctic Peninsula region and in the Cosmonauts and Cooperation Seas while fish take ice krill (Euphausia crystallorophias), Pleuragramma antarcticum and myctophids to some extent in other areas.

We investigated whether reproduction and early larval development are the cause of local recruitment failure. It was found that the majority of adult females were reproductively active in summer and that there was a comparatively high investment in the ovary, reaching up to 46 % of the total wet weight of the krill. The corresponding egg batches were amongst the largest ever reported for E. superba. A semi-empirical model predicted that 11 % of females completed just 1 spawning episode per year, 60 % completed 2, and 29 % completed 3 or more. On average, a South Georgian krill released 12 343 eggs yr-1. The eggs were unable to complete the descent-ascent developmental cycle on-shelf because the bathymetry was too shallow but, off-shelf, they were predicted to sink to between 490 and 520 m and return to the surface either as a metanauplius or 1st calyptopis stage with plenty of energy reserves remaining. Feeding conditions were adequate for the development of later larval stages once these reserves were exhausted. Although net surveys found calyptopis and early stage furcilia in the vicinity of South Georgia, numbers were mostly lower than predicted. Overall, reproduction or early stage development are successful in this region, leaving predation on larvae and advective export during winter as the main potential causes of local recruitment failure. © Inter-Research 2007.",2-s2.0-33947109411

This is part of a study designed to test the hypothesis that Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) populations at South Georgia in the eastern Scotia Sea are sustained by import of individuals from upstream regions, such as the western Antarctic Peninsula. Comparison of the simulated circulation fields obtained from HOPS with observations showed good agreement. The surface circulation, particularly through the Drake Passage and across the Scotia Sea, matches observations, with its northeastward flow characterized by three high-speed fronts. Also, the Weddell Sea and the Brazil Current, and their associated transports match observations. In addition, mesoscale variability, an important component of the flow in this region, is found in the simulated circulation and the model is overall well suited to model krill transport. Drifter simulations conducted with HOPS showed that krill spawned in areas coinciding with known krill spawning sites along the west Antarctic Peninsula continental shelf can be entrained into the Southern Antarctic Circumpolar Current Front (SACCF). They are transported across the Scotia Sea to South Georgia in 10 months or less. Drifters originating on the continental shelf of the Weddell Sea can reach South Georgia as well; however, transport from this region averages about 20 months. Additional simulations show that such transport is sensitive to changes in wind stress and the location of the SACCF. The results of this study show that krill populations along the Antarctic Peninsula and the Weddell Sea are possible source populations that can provide krill to the South Georgia population. However, successful transport of krill to South Georgia is shown to depend on a multitude of factors, such as the location of the spawning area and timing of spawning, and variations in the location of the SACCF. Therefore, this study provides insight into which environmental factors control the successful transport of krill across the Scotia Sea and with it a better understanding of krill distribution in the region. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Surface phytoplankton concentrations along the simulated drifter trajectories were extracted from historical Coastal Zone Color Scanner (CZCS) measurements and sea ice biota concentrations were calculated from sea ice concentration and extent extracted along drifter trajectories from Special Sensor Microwave/Imager measurements. As additional food sources, a time series of heterotrophic food was constructed from historical data, and time series of detritus concentrations were calculated using phytoplankton concentrations extracted from CZCS measurements together with measured particulate organic carbon to chlorophyll a ratios. These food resources along specified drifter trajectories were then input to the krill growth model to determine the size and viability of krill during transport from the source region to South Georgia. The krill growth model simulations showed that no single food source can support continuous growth of krill during the 58-306 days needed for transport to South Georgia. However, under the current assumptions results indicate that combinations of food sources during the transport time enhanced krill survival, with heterotrophic food and detritus being particularly important during periods of low phytoplankton concentrations. The growth model simulations also showed that larval and juvenile krill originating along the western Antarctic Peninsula can grow to 1 + (14-36 mm) and 2 + (26-45 mm) age and size classes observed at South Georgia during the time needed for transport to this region. Krill originating in the Weddell Sea need 20 months for transport, which allows retention in a potentially high food environment, provided by sea ice, for almost 1 year.

The origin and fate of krill observed during the CCAMLR 2000 survey were studied using output from the OCCAM model. Lagrangian particle tracking for the period prior to the survey showed the expected dominance of the west to east flow of material associated with the main direction of the current flow, but there was no simple association of particle transport with any of the fronts of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current. Most of the krill were associated with areas to the south of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current in the Weddell-Scotia Confluence (WSC) and farther east in Weddell Sea-influenced waters. Examining the pathways of krill transport in relation to satellite-derived sea-ice distributions suggests that particles present in the high krill biomass regions in January would have come from areas that were covered by sea-ice during late winter/early spring (September-October). The results of Eulerian grid-based simulations of the development of the biomass distribution after the survey period showed transport of particles around South Georgia, probably in association with the Southern Antarctic Circumpolar Current Front. However, many of the krill encountered in the eastern Scotia Sea would have exited toward the east, passing north of the South Sandwich Islands, probably in association with the Southern Boundary of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current and Weddell Sea waters that penetrate to the north in this area. These krill may return to more southern regions where further spawning is possible in later years. Simulations of particle tracks that included diurnal vertical migration showed that krill behavior could modify the pathways of transport, although the current flows probably dominate the movement of krill in open ocean regions. This study suggests that the summer distribution of krill in the Scotia Sea is connected to the winter sea-ice distribution and probably to the pattern and rate of the spring sea-ice retreat. Many of the krill in the survey region in the summer of 1999/2000 came from under the sea-ice in the eastern Scotia Sea, the southern Scotia Arc, and the northern Weddell Sea. This highlights that the spatial association of the sea-ice with the Weddell-Scotia Confluence and frontal regions of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current during winter and spring will be crucial in determining the summer krill distribution. Variation in the extent and timing of sea-ice retreat, and fluctuations in Weddell-Scotia Confluence and Scotia Sea flows, will change the pathways of transport resulting in large changes in the distribution of the krill during summer. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

Inputs to the model are monthly mean climatologies of ambient temperature and density fields obtained from the World Ocean Atlas Database for Southern Ocean waters. Simulations are done with a 1° resolution at a circumpolar scale, south of 60°S, and the results are interpolated to a 5′ grid to match the resolution of the bottom bathymetry data. Simulations of the descent-ascent cycle using environmental conditions corresponding to the Antarctic krill spawning season (December-March) resulted in unconstrained success in completion of the cycle in water deeper than 1000 m. Continental shelf regions favorable to successful hatching of Antarctic krill embryos are limited to areas along the west Antarctic Peninsula, large areas in the Bellingshausen and Amundsen Seas, offshore of Wilkes Land, and to the east and west of Prydz Bay. These are regions where the Southern Antarctic Circumpolar Current Front is along the shelf slope, the Antarctic Slope Front is absent, and Circumpolar Deep Water is present. The effect of seasonal variability in temperature on the descent-ascent cycle tends to enhance the probability of success in regions offshore of Wilkes Land, Queen Maud Land, and the eastern shelf of the Antarctic Peninsula later in the spawning season. The simulations show that success of the descent-ascent cycle is sensitive to initial embryo diameter and larval ascent rate. Initial embryo diameter may provide an additional constraint on success of the descent-ascent cycle, especially in continental shelf waters, where small embryos tend to encounter the bottom before hatching. The circumpolar distributions of simulated embryo hatching depth and larval success show that all regions of the Antarctic are not equal in the ability to support successful completion of the Antarctic krill descent-ascent cycle, which has implications for the overall circum-Antarctic krill distribution and for the development of nutrient and material budgets, especially for Antarctic continental shelf areas. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

The age composition of the southern and northern groupings differs markedly, with substantial reduction in numbers of early age groups in the northern grouping. Long-term observations of spawning success, recruitment, and age composition suggest that a self-sustained grouping of krill persists in the Cooperation Sea south of the Antarctic Divergence.

Depending on their ecological niche and trophic position, zooplankton species at high latitudes have developed a variety of reproductive strategies and energetic adaptations to cope with these extreme environmental conditions. Life-cycle strategies of the herbivorous copepods and euphausiids, which make up the major portion of polar zooplankton biomass, include seasonal vertical migration, dormancy (diapause, quiescence) and the accumulation of energy reserves. These lipid stores help to buffer the pulsed seasonal food supply, and they play an important role in fueling reproduction independent of phytoplankton. Only a smaller fraction of the lipid reserves accumulated during spring and summer are usually catabolized for metabolic maintenance during the food-limited dark season. These deposits are retained until the end of winter and allow early egg production and spawning prior to—or coinciding with—the onset of vernal primary production. It enables the new generation to make full use of the short productive season for growth and development to reach viable overwintering stages. The Antarctic krill Euphausia superba is an exception since it uses its depot lipids for metabolic maintenance during the dark season. It therefore relies on external resources (Primary production) for reproductive processes, resulting in a later spawning period as compared to the other euphausiids. Another important component of the herbivorous Antarctic zooplankton, the salps, have developed a very different reproductive strategy. They are able to switch from sexual reproduction to asexual budding (metagenesis), which allows extreme multiplication rates under favourable feeding conditions. Due to these successful adaptations, herbivores are able to build up huge stocks, in spite of the short productive period. Omnivorous and carnivorous zooplankton species, e.g., amphipods or chaetognaths, are not much constrained by the seasonality problem, but experience a more constant food supply. They show a tendency towards K strategies with a prolonged reproductive period, reduced egg numbers and increasing parental care. However, they do not exhibit such typical “polar adaptations” as developed by the herbivorous species. © 1999 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",2-s2.0-0032875991

The research area comprised offshore, ice-edge and Ross Sea areas. Of the 3 years (1990/91, 1992/93 and 1994/95) included in the study, 1994/95 was a year of significantly poor body fat condition compared with the other 2 years. The 1994/95 year was characterized by extensive sea-ice conditions, covering the usually krill-rich slope region throughout the season. Since minke whales were scarce and their stomach-content mass small in the ice-edge area during 1994/95, food availability in the area during the season was considered to be poor as a result of the high sea-ice extent. Antarctic krill Euphausia superba was regularly the dominant prey species throughout the survey area, although on the Ross Sea shelf E. crystallorophias was the codominant prey with E. superba. The spatial distribution of body size and maturity of E. superba indicated apparent unsuitability of the Ross Sea area as a nursery and spawning ground for that species. The Ross Sea area was considered to be an area of low food supply throughout the study period, considering the lower level of stomach contents. Paradoxically, this area usually contained numerous minke whales, especially pregnant females.

Northern stations were characterized by 'high lipid-high triglyceride' content, western and eastern locations by 'high lipid-high phosphatidyl choline' content and southern areas by 'low lipid-high phosphatidyl ethanolamine/glycolipid' content. Such variability was likely related to advected populations having spent variable lengths of time in the area studied.

From early to mid-summer krill density increased and showed distinct offshore-inshore differences in abundance and maturity stages. In mid-summer, krill density was low in the oceanic zone (8 g m-2) and higher in the slope frontal zone (36 g m-2), being highest along the shelf break (131 g m-2) in the inshore zone. Krill were in the reproductive stage in the oceanic and frontal zones, but non-reproductive in the inshore zone. Water circulation, food and frontal features were considered important environmental factors determining the occurrence of high krill concentrations in these waters. Drifting buoys indicated that the surface water circulation in areas of krill concentrations was characterized by a sluggish current with eddies along the shelf break in the inshore zone and a shear current in the frontal zone, thus enhancing the residence time for krill. Diatom abundance in both the frontal and inshore zones increased from early to mid-summer, improving krill feeding conditions. Gravid females were closely associated with the frontal zone, showing that the latter may also be a favored spawning area because of the higher probability of survival for embryos and larvae; in addition to enhanced opportunities for their transport to nursery grounds by prevailing currents. In the waters north of the South Shetland Islands, krill appeared to be highly adapted for exploitation of the rich food resources of the frontal/inshore zone, taking advantage of oceanographic features that led to their retention in these zones.",2-s2.0-0031783385

This was used with a Lagrangian model to investigate transport of Antarctic krill. Particle displacements from known krill spawning areas that result from surface Ekman drift, a composite large-scale flow, and the combination of the two were calculated. Surface Ekman drift alone only transports particles a few kilometres over the 150-day krill larval development time. The large-scale composite flow moves particles several hundreds of kilometres over the same time, suggesting this is the primary transport mechanism. An important contribution of the surface Ekman drift on particles released along the continental shelf break west of the Antarctic Peninsula is moving them north-northeast into the high-speed core of the southern Antarctic Circumpolar Current Front, which then transports the particles to South Georgia in about 140-160 days. Similar particle displacement calculations using surface flow fields obtained from the Fine Resolution Antarctic Model do not show overall transport from the Antarctic Peninsula to South Georgia due to the inaccurate position of the southern Antarctic Circumpolar Current Front in the simulated circulation fields. The particle transit times obtained with the composite large-scale flow field are consistent with regional abundances of larval krill developmental stages collected in the Scotia Sea.

In particular years (1975/76, 1980/81), krill spawning in the western Atlantic sector began relatively early, was intensive, and completed early. Some years (1977/78, 1981/82) were characterised by long and non-synchronised krill spawning. Compiled data sets for the Atlantic sector (1980/81), the entire Antarctic (1983/84) and the east Indian-west Pacific Antarctic waters (1981-85) reveal some spatial patterns in krill reproductive timing. In relation to spawning timing variation, the habitats of the krill population fall into five categories: (1) areas with an early beginning (late Novemberearly December) and a variable, but normally long, duration (3-3.5 months) of krill spawning; this is generally the southern boundary of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current, (2) areas with an early beginning, but a short duration of krill spawning (Gerlache Strait), (3) areas with a highly variable (within 1-1.5 months) beginning and a relatively long duration (ca. 3 months) of krill spawning (Bransfield Strait, Palmer Archipelago), (4) areas with a late beginning (late December-January) and a long duration of krill spawning (Bellingshausen Sea, D'Urville Sea, and Balleny Islands area), and (5) areas with a delayed beginning, but a very short duration (ca. 1.5 months) of krill spawning (Ross Sea slope, probably the Coastal Current area off the Lasarev Sea shelf and in the south-eastern Weddell Sea. These patterns can be partly explained by peculiarities of the ice regime in particular areas and by routes of krill movement within water circulation systems. © 1995 Springer-Verlag.",2-s2.0-0028993553

The Lagrangian calculations show that: (1) surface flow is the primary factor influencing the final location of the embryo-larva particle; and (2) timing of krill spawning affects the eventual position of the feeding larvae. Seasonal changes in the wind stress field result in variability in direction and velocity of surface currents, which affects the embryo-larva trajectories. Conditions favourable for the transport of larvae to Bransfield Strait occur early in the spawning season. East of the Antarctic Peninsula larvae have a greater probability of entering Bransfield Strait if the krill embryos are released in mid-summer, January to February. Embryos released to the north of the South Shetland Islands, west of 62°W are transported into Drake Passage. Embryos released to the north of the South Shetland Islands and east of Livingston Island are transported westward where they can eventually enter Bransfield Strait. Krill larvae also are transported into Bransfield Strait from the Bellingshausen and Weddell Seas. The Lagrangian trajectories show that the western Bransfield Strait is a region of potentially high larval concentration due to transport from surrounding areas as well as local production. This is in agreement with observed krill larvae distributions, which show higher concentrations in this region. © 1992.",2-s2.0-0027009053

This model combines laboratory measurements of temperature effects on developmental times, density and physiology of krill embryos and larvae and the observed water temperature structure in the Bransfield Strait-South Shetland Islands region. Simulations with observed vertical temperature profiles from this region show that embryos that develop at temperatures less than 0°C hatch relatively deep (≈1000 m) or hit the bottom before hatching. The presence of warm (1-2°C) Circumpolar Deep Water (CDW), between 200 and 700 m, results in hatching depths of about 700 m. The sinking rate pattern characteristic of the embryos of Euphausia superba retains the embryos in the CDW, where development is accelerated. Larval ascent rate through the CDW is rapid, so larvae reach the surface before metamorphosing into the first feeding stage, and have sufficient carbon reserves to drift at the surface for several weeks before needing to find food. These results suggest that the sinking rate pattern characteristic of embryos of Antarctic krill may be part of a reproductive strategy that evolved in response to the thermal structure of its environment. The complementary component of this reproductive strategy is the observed correlation between the distribution of krill schools containing reproducing individuals and the presence of CDW. With this reproductive strategy, the spawning regions of Antarctic krill are in areas where oceanic conditions enhance the probability of survival of its embryos and non-feeding larvae. © 1992.",2-s2.0-0027009051

A total of 153 eggs from two species and 1368 larvae or juvenile stages from 12 species were obtained. These included pelagic species, and demersal species with a long pelagic larval or juvenile phase. Most abundant were larvae of Pleuragramma antarcticum and Notothenia kempi, and eggs of Notothenia neglecta. The distribution of notothenioid and paralepidid larvae was apparently unaffected by ice cover, whereas myctophid larvae were confined to ice-free waters. Areas where newly hatched Chionodraco hamatus occurred coincided with dense aggregations of Euphausia superba (Krill) furcilia larvae which is a potential food resource during winter. The hatching of icefish larvae during winter is apparently independent of the seasonal production cycle. Epipelagic eggs of Notothenia neglecta were found during the spawning season, which suggests that eggs ascend to the surface after demersal spawning and that development takes place near the sea surface during winter. Larvae of Notothenia kempi were chiefly confined to shelf and slope waters to the west of the Antarctic Peninsula, with larger larvae found in coastal shelf areas. Pleuragramma antarcticum occurred in the coastal waters off the Biscoe Islands, in the Gerlache Strait, and in the northern Bransfield Strait. The smallest larvae were found in the northern Bransfield Strait, whereas those at the Biscoe Islands and in Gerlache Strait waters were larger and of a similar size. A cyclonic gyre to the west of the Antarctic Peninsula observed in the austral summer was likely to have affected the larval drift of Pleuragramma antarcticum and Notothenia kempi. Differences in the timing of spawning and hatching and the vertical distribution of these larvae will lead to different transport and spatial distribution patterns. It is hypothesized that early winter conditions do not imply severe limitations on the year-class success of larval fish. Dispersal and increased mortality may occur during the second half of the winter. © 1991 Springer-Verlag.",2-s2.0-0000770434

The geographical distribution of spawning populations combined with the observed pattern in sinking rates of embryos during development form a reproductive strategy that maximises survival of the early non-feeding stages. The first winter is the second critical period. Physiological condition of larvae and juveniles is an index of their nutritional history and ability to survive and enter the adult population the following summer. Significant differences were found in the physiological condition of larvae collected during two winters which differed primarily in the degree of ice cover. Larvae in the heavy ice winter had higher growth rates, higher condition factor and more lipid.

During an initial (December to January) peak in production to phytoplankton and krill larvae in Gerlache Strait and adjacent parts of Bransfield Strait, so few post-larvae and adults were caught that the parent stock of those larvae could not be identified with certainty. However, small adults of 36-42 mm body length were caught in abundance later in the summer (February to March), after larval recruitment in and near Gerlache Strait had ceased. Many of these small adults then appeared to be post-reproductive. In Bransfield Strait during late summer (late February to March) there was a nearly equal mixture of small adults (which dominated in Gerlache Strait) and large adults (>42 mm): the large adults showed most evidence of recent reproductive activity and could have been responsible for much of the late summer larval recruitment in Bransfield Strait. In Drake Passage, large adults were usually dominant; the few caught in December were undergoing maturation near the South Shetlands, and in January they were reproductive and dispersed in more offshore oceanic waters. During late February to March, krill became more available in Drake Passage with many having reassembled in aggregations near Livingston Island (South Shetlands). By then, not only small adults but also large adults appeared post-reproductive in all areas. Evidence relating to growth rate in adults was obscured by erratic variations in ratios of body-length classes, month-to-month, considered artifacts on sampling. However, adult growth appeared negligible during January to March. After midsummer (January) there were distinct changes in relative abundances of males to females of >42 mm: within 43-47 mm the modal frequencies favored females, and within 48-55 mm males were dominant, suggesting differential survivorship. The Gerlache-Bransfield Straits and similar coastal habitats must be considered nursery areas, not only for immature krill as has been previously proposed, but also for early summer larvae. In particularly productive years, as in 1986-87, these coastal waters may become spawning localities for small adult krill before production by large adults develops farther away from the Peninsula. Immatures of <12 mm in December and ca 16-30 mm by March, comprised a subgroup of the smallest immature krill though not consistently abundant enough to be distinguished as a year class. Their distributions suggest origins and early growth outside of the study area, possibly in the Weddell Sea and coastal waters of the Bellingshausen Sea. © 1991.",2-s2.0-0026304315

Seasonal feeding was examined from 1977/1978 (November-March). The diel feeding cycle was investigated during a 96 h station established in February 1976, while food selection was analyzed using larvae and zooplankton samples collected in February 1982. Hatching occurs in early spring, and larvae fed on eggs of calanoid copepods and on cyclopoid copepods. Copepod eggs were the principal food near the pack ice, and cyclopoids in open waters. Cyclopoids were the staple food in summer. Eggs of the Antarctic krill Euphausia superba were ingested selectively and formed major portions of the larval summer diet in neritic (Joinville Island) and oceanic (Elephant Island) spawning areas of E. superba. In the fall, copepods predominated in the diets. Most abundant and most frequently ingested prey in summer and fall were Oncaea spp. Feeding commenced at dawn and continued at least until dusk. Krill eggs were taken chiefly during morning hours and egg incidence declined during the day, suggesting that eggs were ingested soon after spawning. Prey size at the onset of feeding was estimated as 0.130 to 0.330 mm. Size-selective feeding was evident in small larvae, while in larger larvae median prey length remained constant. High feeding incidence among yolk-sac larvae in spring, high overall feeding incidence in summer, and size-selective foraging of small larvae suggested favorable feeding conditions in the 1977/1978 season. Yolk-absorption times in Antarctic fish larvae vary on a scale of weeks and may be further retarded due to early feeding. Hence, year-to-year variability of yolk incidence in N. larseni indicated variable biotic environments of early feeding larvae rather than temporal shifts of hatching periods. As hatching periods are constant between years in contrast to the variable retreat of the pack ice and subsequent onset of the production cycle in space and time, maternal yolk reserves are probably utilized to compensate for such variations. © 1990 Springer-Verlag.",2-s2.0-0025143853

During both surveys the major contrast was between the plankton of the shelf and the surrounding ocean. However, within the oceanic part of each grid, localized areas of warmer water were inhabited by a fauna characteristics of warmer latitudes to the north. The biological and oceanographic evidence suggests that areas represents core rings or similar intrusions from north of the Polar Front. Not all of the characteristic warm- and cold-water species showed a clear correlation with water origin. For example, the swarming behaviour of Euphausia superba limited its usefulness as a mesoscale tracer. Likewise, the distribution of the Antarctic copepod Calanoides acutus was poorly related to water temperature during the summer survey because the timing of sampling coincided with its annual spawning cycle. Large-scale movement of oceanic fronts has already been identified as being important in dictating overall species composition around the island, but at a smaller scale these intrusions of warmer water may be an important intermediary mechanism of community advection into the area. © 1990.",2-s2.0-0025632374

The relationship between temperature and developmental times was curvilinear, with a sharp decrease in developmental time between -1 and 0°C, followed by a gradual flattening of the curve. The relationship was best described by the exponential model D = B0* e-B1(T) + B2, where D is developmental time in days, T is the temperature, and B0, B1, and B2 are fitted constants. In three of the four batches of larvae reared at -1°C, all larvae died within 3 days of metamorphosis to Calyptopis 1, while siblings at higher temperatures developed normally. These results suggests that a cold sensitive period exists during early larval development. The type of food available also affected the survival of three groups of siblings. Larvae fed a diatom mixture developed normally, while those fed a small flagellate or starved all died before metamorphosis to Calyptopis 2. The effects of temperature and food type on the development and survival of the early larval stages have important ecological implications for the recruitment of E. superba. If spawning occurs in areas where the embryos or larvae encounter subzero water during a temperature sensitive period, recruitment in these waters may be very low, independent of food availability. If the embryos and larvae do not encounter subzero water during a sensitive period, recruitment may be more dependent on the type and concentration of food available. © 1988.",2-s2.0-0024260465

Juveniles in November 1977 fed mainly on calanoid copepods and Oithona spp. The principal food of postlarvae in February 1982 were Oncaea spp., eggs of calanoid copepods and tintinnids whereas the staple food of juveniles in February 1982 consisted of calanoid copepods of which copepodites of Calanus propinquus were most abundant. Eggs of Euphausia superba were frequently ingested by postlarvae and were the main component of the juvenile diet in the Antarctic Sound. Postlarvae in March 1981 preyed on Oncaea spp. and calanoid eggs. There was a shift from feeding on cyclopoid copepods by postlarvae to feeding on calanoids by juveniles. The food particle size increased as a function of fish length. Maximum prey size was controlled by mouth width up to at least 45 mm standard length. Prey selection was apparently food density dependent with an inverse relationship between food abundance and selective feeding. Density dependent size selection may have resulted in resource partitioning among postlarval and juvenile fishes in February. This specific feeding behaviour is likely to be an adaptation to the low zooplankton stocks of the high Antarctic shelf waters to minimize food competition among the youngest age classes. Predation on krill eggs indicated that the frequent association of one year old juvenile Pleuragramma antarcticum with the Antarctic krill is related to local spawning events. © 1987 Springer-Verlag.",2-s2.0-0000262486

Population dynamics are defined by time- and length-dependent birth, growth and death rates. In a steady state (constant death rate of 98.7% p. a.) Krill frequency and weight oscillate by a factor of 32 and 3, respectively. Larval catch curves from German Antarctic Expeditions and published mortality rates for older Krill suggest a hyperbolic form of the survival function with age (i.e. mortality decreases with increasing body length). A Krill fishery can be simulated indirectly through manipulation of the mortality rate or through direct elimination of individuals. For example, a complete elimination of the upper length classes does not lead to extinction even if performed each year before the spawning season, as long as the size at fist capture is greater than 45 mm. The Antarctic Krill seems to be a classical example of r-selection with its high fertility, high mortality and large stock fluctuations. © 1986 Springer-Verlag.",2-s2.0-0343757100

The author reviews the known data on the life cycle of krill and concludes that water density variations and its circulation are the most important factors controlling its distribution and numbers. While it is generally established that the life span ofEuphausia superbain the ocean is of the order of 2½‐4 years the author suggests that it may well be longer under ideal circumstances. However, since, after spawning, the krill is carried down to abyssal depths by the descending water at the Antarctic Convergence it is rarely given the opportunity to achieve its maximum potential age. It is further suggested that this point in the life cycle, i.e., after spawning and before the downwards plunge at the Antarctic Convergence would be the optimal point for intense exploitation since it would have minimal impact on krill stocks or on the other components of the marine biocenosis. © 1984 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",2-s2.0-84960627371
