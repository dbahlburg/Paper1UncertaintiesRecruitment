Within the Southern Ocean, Antarctic krill (Euphausia Superba) support many marine predators and play a key role in the biogeochemical cycle. Ocean acidification and plastic pollution have been acknowledged to hinder Antarctic krill development and physiology in singularity, however potential multi-stressor effects of plastic particulates coupled with ocean acidification are unexplored. Furthermore, Antarctic krill may be especially vulnerable to plastic pollution due to their close association with sea-ice, a known plastic sink. Here, we investigate the behaviour of nanoplastic [spherical, aminated (NH2), and yellow-green fluorescent polystyrene nanoparticles] in Antarctic seawater and explore the single and combined effects of nanoplastic (160 nm radius, at a concentration of 2.5 μg ml–1) and ocean acidification (pCO2 ∼900, pHT 7.7) on the embryonic development of Antarctic krill. Gravid female krill were collected in the Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean (North Scotia Sea). Produced eggs were incubated at 0.5 °C in four treatments (control, nanoplastic, ocean acidification and the multi-stressor scenario of nanoplastic presence, and ocean acidification) and their embryonic development after 6 days, at the incubation endpoint, was determined. We observed that negatively charged nanoplastic particles suspended in seawater from the Scotia Sea aggregated to sizes exceeding the nanoscale after 24 h (1054.13 ± 53.49 nm). Further, we found that the proportion of embryos developing through the early stages to reach at least the limb bud stage was highest in the control treatment (21.84%) and lowest in the multi-stressor treatment (13.17%). Since the biological thresholds to any stressors can be altered by the presence of additional stressors, we propose that future nanoplastic ecotoxicology studies should consider the changing global ocean under future climate scenarios for assessments of their impact and highlight that determining the behaviour of nanoplastic particles used in incubation studies is critical to determining their toxicity. © Copyright © 2021 Rowlands, Galloway, Cole, Lewis, Peck, Thorpe and Manno.",2-s2.0-85113143344

Successful embryonic development and hatching are key to their life cycle, but despite the rapid climatic warming seen across their main spawning areas, the effects of elevated temperatures on embryogenesis, hatching success, and nauplii malformations are unknown. We incubated 24,483 krill embryos in two independent experiments to investigate the hypothesis that temperatures exceeding 1.5°C have a negative impact on hatching success and increase the numbers of malformed nauplii. Field experiments were on krill collected from near the northern, warm limit of their range and embryos incubated soon after capture, while laboratory experiments were on embryos from krill acclimated to laboratory conditions. The hatching success of embryo batches varied enormously, from 0 to 98% (mean 27%). Both field and laboratory experiments showed that hatching success decreased markedly above 3.0°C. Our field experiments also showed an approximate doubling of the percentage of malformed nauplii at elevated temperatures, reaching 50% at 5.0°C. At 3.0°C or below, however, temperature was not the main factor driving the large variation in embryo hatching success. Our observations of highly variable and often low success of hatching to healthy nauplii suggest that indices of reproductive potential of female krill relate poorly to the subsequent production of viable krill larvae and may help to explain spatial discrepancies between the distribution of the spawning stock and larval distribution. © Copyright © 2020 Perry, Kawaguchi, Atkinson, Sailley, Tarling, Mayor, Lucas, King and Cooper.",2-s2.0-85087501321

It occurs in higher numbers in the warmer mid-latitude waters of the Southern Ocean. In recent decades, salp populations shifted significantly southward intruding into areas generally dominated by Antarctic krill. It is unclear whether salps can survive in high latitude waters because of their hypothesized negative reproductive response to low temperatures and scarcity of food. To explore how environmental conditions impact S. thompsoni reproductive fitness, we examined a long-term (1993–2013), cross-latitudinal dataset of S. thompsoni population demographics in the Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean. Observations cover over 25° of latitude, from just south of the Subtropical Convergence to the Antarctic continent. S. thompsoni populations were strongly driven by temperature with higher abundances observed at temperatures between 3°C and 5°C. Occasionally, dense and mature populations of S. thompsoni occurred at high latitudes during summer, declining in density by autumn, which was accompanied by significant increases in the appearance of failed embryos. The proportion of failed embryos was significantly correlated with decreasing temperature and Chl a, indicating the importance of these parameters in autumn and high latitude population collapses. The successful development and release of an embryo is a critical factor determining the persistence of S. thompsoni populations. Blastozooid bud release occurred continuously from spring to autumn, and may be a way S. thompsoni populations mitigate against the sensitivity of the blastozooid's reproductive fitness to high-Antarctic conditions. © 2018 Association for the Sciences of Limnology and Oceanography",2-s2.0-85062896077

It is found from the Subtropical Convergence southward to the coastal Antarctic Seas but being most abundant in the Antarctic Polar Frontal Zone. Low temperatures appear to negatively affect their development, limiting their ability to occur in the krill dominated high Antarctic ecosystems. Yet reports indicate that with ocean warming S. thompsoni have experienced a southward shift in their distribution. As they are efficient filter feeders, this shift can result in large-scale changes in the Southern Ocean ecosystem by increasing competitive or predatory interactions with Antarctic krill. To explore salp bloom dynamics in the Southern Ocean a size-structured S. thompsoni population model was developed with growth, consumption, reproduction and mortality rates dependent on temperature and chlorophyll a conditions. The largest uncertainties in S. thompsoni population ecology are individual and population growth rates, with a recent study identifying the possibility that the life cycle could be much shorter than previously considered. Here we run a suite of hypothesis scenarios under various environmental conditions to determine the most appropriate growth rate. Temperature and chlorophyll a were sufficient drivers to recreate seasonal and interannual dynamics of salp populations at two locations. The most suitable growth model suggests that mean S. thompsoni growth rates are likely to be ∼1 mm body length d−1, 2-fold higher than previous calculations. S. thompsoni biomass was dependent on bud release time, with larger biomass years corresponding to bud release occurring during favorable environmental conditions; increasing the survival and growth of blastozooids and resulting in higher embryo release. This model confirms that it is necessary for growth and reproductive rates to be flexible in order for the salp population to adapt to varying environmental conditions and provides a framework that can examine how future salp populations might respond to climate change. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",2-s2.0-85052938191

Feeding on seasonally productive prey species, followed by extended fasting associated with energy intensive activities, such as migration, competitive breeding behavior, pregnancy, and lactation, results in massive fluctuations in lipid reserves. These fluctuations are mirrored in the toxicokinetics of lipophilic contaminant burdens, with significant mobilization and redistribution of contaminants taking place between the individual's tissues during this time. While the toxicologic consequence of this life-history behavior remains unquantified, fasting should be thought of as a time of ""reexposure"" of target sites of toxicity to harmful chemicals. Of significant relevance is the temporal cooccurrence of pregnancy and nursing of young calves, with elevated circulating maternal chemical burdens. Elevated maternal offloading of persistent organic pollutants to the young is further exacerbated by the disproportionate exposure experienced by the embryo and calf on account of a smaller body size. The interplay of multiple stressors, for example, chemical exposure, negative energy balance, and immune function, during migration remains a critical nexus of priority for future investigation. The importance of such investigations are underscored by the vulnerability of the Antarctic sea-ice ecosystem to the direct effects of polar climate change, which may result in further energetic challenges to Southern Ocean mysticetes, already adapted to metabolic extremes. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Precision and bias were estimated graphically using Chang's index (Coefficient of Variation = 5.03%). High accuracy and precision between readers and low ageing bias indicate that longitudinal sections of eyestalks can be used to age krill in wild samples and to develop age-based stock assessment models for krill.

The relatively simple food web of this area relies on krill - Euphausia superba. Presumably, as a result of climatic fluctuations, a decrease in the number of this crustacean has been recorded, followed by an increase in the population of the gelatinous zooplankter Salpa thompsoni. In the research presented herein, population and morphometric analyses of Salpa thompsoni have been conducted. Specimens for this research were collected from the Drake Passage, using a Bongo net in the summer season of 2010. It has been found that the horizontal distribution of this gelatinous zooplankter was significantly irregular (Kruskal-Wallis test, p < 0.001). In the northern part of the investigated area, both blastozooids and oozooids were recorded, which confirms the dynamic development of this species. The central part of the Drake Passage was characterized by the dominance of blastozooids, with embryos found at different stages of the development. Only in the region of the South Shetland Islands, the salpid population was characterized by reduced or even stopped reproduction. The immense reproductive efficiency observed in the Salpa thompsoni population was mostly induced by the favourable thermal conditions. These observations may suggest that the ongoing climat changes in the West Antarctic will promote the population expansion of this species. © 2015 Polish Academy of Sciences.",2-s2.0-84952025966

The transport and fate of the embryo and larva under present and modified conditions was investigated with Lagrangian particle tracking simulations. The two modeling studies were implemented using temperature and density (embryo-larva model) and circulation distributions (Lagrangian particle tracking) obtained from a high resolution version of the Regional Ocean Modeling System configured for the wAP shelf region. Additional simulations used temperature and circulation distributions obtained from simulations that were forced with increased wind speed and increased transport of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC), both projected to possibly occur with climate change in the wAP region. Simulations using present conditions showed that successful completion of the descent-ascent cycle occurred along the outer shelf and on the shelf in regions with bottom depths of 600-700. m. Estimated residence times for the shelf regions that support success of the embryo and larva were 20-30 days. Thus, krill spawned in the mid and inner shelf regions can be retained in these regions through development to the first feeding stage (calyptopis 1). Increased winds and ACC transport resulted in more onshelf transport of Circumpolar Deep Water (CDW), which increased the volume of warm (1-1.5. °C) water at depth. These conditions supported a moderate increase in success of the krill embryo and larva, but only for limited areas of the shelf where hatching depths decreased by 10-30. m (<5%) and development time to the calyptopis 1 stage decreased by 15-20%. The modified circulation conditions also supported increased advection of krill larvae into areas of the shelf that would experience the largest reduction of sea ice, especially in winter. Projected changes in wind strength and CDW transport may potentially enhance larval survival and advection onto the wAP shelf, but recruitment may be decreased by modifications to local sea ice distributions that would impede survival of Antarctic krill that overwinter on the shelf. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",2-s2.0-84883197741

Simulations are done with a 1° resolution at a circumpolar scale, south of 60°S, and the results are interpolated to a 5′ grid to match the resolution of the bottom bathymetry data. Simulations of the descent-ascent cycle using environmental conditions corresponding to the Antarctic krill spawning season (December-March) resulted in unconstrained success in completion of the cycle in water deeper than 1000 m. Continental shelf regions favorable to successful hatching of Antarctic krill embryos are limited to areas along the west Antarctic Peninsula, large areas in the Bellingshausen and Amundsen Seas, offshore of Wilkes Land, and to the east and west of Prydz Bay. These are regions where the Southern Antarctic Circumpolar Current Front is along the shelf slope, the Antarctic Slope Front is absent, and Circumpolar Deep Water is present. The effect of seasonal variability in temperature on the descent-ascent cycle tends to enhance the probability of success in regions offshore of Wilkes Land, Queen Maud Land, and the eastern shelf of the Antarctic Peninsula later in the spawning season. The simulations show that success of the descent-ascent cycle is sensitive to initial embryo diameter and larval ascent rate. Initial embryo diameter may provide an additional constraint on success of the descent-ascent cycle, especially in continental shelf waters, where small embryos tend to encounter the bottom before hatching. The circumpolar distributions of simulated embryo hatching depth and larval success show that all regions of the Antarctic are not equal in the ability to support successful completion of the Antarctic krill descent-ascent cycle, which has implications for the overall circum-Antarctic krill distribution and for the development of nutrient and material budgets, especially for Antarctic continental shelf areas. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

The timing of the spring sea ice retreat and the extent of sea ice in the spring (September through November) appear to significantly affect the intensity and timing of reproduction in the population.

From early to mid-summer krill density increased and showed distinct offshore-inshore differences in abundance and maturity stages. In mid-summer, krill density was low in the oceanic zone (8 g m-2) and higher in the slope frontal zone (36 g m-2), being highest along the shelf break (131 g m-2) in the inshore zone. Krill were in the reproductive stage in the oceanic and frontal zones, but non-reproductive in the inshore zone. Water circulation, food and frontal features were considered important environmental factors determining the occurrence of high krill concentrations in these waters. Drifting buoys indicated that the surface water circulation in areas of krill concentrations was characterized by a sluggish current with eddies along the shelf break in the inshore zone and a shear current in the frontal zone, thus enhancing the residence time for krill. Diatom abundance in both the frontal and inshore zones increased from early to mid-summer, improving krill feeding conditions. Gravid females were closely associated with the frontal zone, showing that the latter may also be a favored spawning area because of the higher probability of survival for embryos and larvae; in addition to enhanced opportunities for their transport to nursery grounds by prevailing currents. In the waters north of the South Shetland Islands, krill appeared to be highly adapted for exploitation of the rich food resources of the frontal/inshore zone, taking advantage of oceanographic features that led to their retention in these zones.",2-s2.0-0031783385

The Lagrangian calculations show that: (1) surface flow is the primary factor influencing the final location of the embryo-larva particle; and (2) timing of krill spawning affects the eventual position of the feeding larvae. Seasonal changes in the wind stress field result in variability in direction and velocity of surface currents, which affects the embryo-larva trajectories. Conditions favourable for the transport of larvae to Bransfield Strait occur early in the spawning season. East of the Antarctic Peninsula larvae have a greater probability of entering Bransfield Strait if the krill embryos are released in mid-summer, January to February. Embryos released to the north of the South Shetland Islands, west of 62°W are transported into Drake Passage. Embryos released to the north of the South Shetland Islands and east of Livingston Island are transported westward where they can eventually enter Bransfield Strait. Krill larvae also are transported into Bransfield Strait from the Bellingshausen and Weddell Seas. The Lagrangian trajectories show that the western Bransfield Strait is a region of potentially high larval concentration due to transport from surrounding areas as well as local production. This is in agreement with observed krill larvae distributions, which show higher concentrations in this region. © 1992.",2-s2.0-0027009053

This model combines laboratory measurements of temperature effects on developmental times, density and physiology of krill embryos and larvae and the observed water temperature structure in the Bransfield Strait-South Shetland Islands region. Simulations with observed vertical temperature profiles from this region show that embryos that develop at temperatures less than 0°C hatch relatively deep (≈1000 m) or hit the bottom before hatching. The presence of warm (1-2°C) Circumpolar Deep Water (CDW), between 200 and 700 m, results in hatching depths of about 700 m. The sinking rate pattern characteristic of the embryos of Euphausia superba retains the embryos in the CDW, where development is accelerated. Larval ascent rate through the CDW is rapid, so larvae reach the surface before metamorphosing into the first feeding stage, and have sufficient carbon reserves to drift at the surface for several weeks before needing to find food. These results suggest that the sinking rate pattern characteristic of embryos of Antarctic krill may be part of a reproductive strategy that evolved in response to the thermal structure of its environment. The complementary component of this reproductive strategy is the observed correlation between the distribution of krill schools containing reproducing individuals and the presence of CDW. With this reproductive strategy, the spawning regions of Antarctic krill are in areas where oceanic conditions enhance the probability of survival of its embryos and non-feeding larvae. © 1992.",2-s2.0-0027009051

The first critical period occurs during development of the non-feeding stages. Release of embryos over warm deep water (250-400 m) is advantageous for these early larval stages. The geographical distribution of spawning populations combined with the observed pattern in sinking rates of embryos during development form a reproductive strategy that maximises survival of the early non-feeding stages. The first winter is the second critical period. Physiological condition of larvae and juveniles is an index of their nutritional history and ability to survive and enter the adult population the following summer. Significant differences were found in the physiological condition of larvae collected during two winters which differed primarily in the degree of ice cover. Larvae in the heavy ice winter had higher growth rates, higher condition factor and more lipid. Although phytoplankton in the water column were scarce in both winters, ice biota were an additional possible source of food during the heavy ice winter. -from Authors",2-s2.0-0026379432

The relative and absolute use of C and N during early development supported the hypothesis that lipid stores were the primary catabolic substratum during development to Cl and mid-way through Cl. Both measured and calculated estimates of the C required to develop from hatching to Cl indicated that larvae developing at higher temperatures used less energy to reach the Cl stage. After metamorphosis to the Cl stage, internal C reserves continued to satisfy ≈90% of calculated C requirements of fed larvae but the availability of food during this time may be important for development of the digestive enzyme system or of efficient feeding behavior. Development, growth, survival and elemental composition of larvae that experienced delays in food availability after metamorphosis to Cl were observed at 0 and 2 °C. Results of these experiments were used to determine the point-of-no-return (PNR) and quantify the importance of energy reserves to the first feeding stage. If initial delays in food availability exceed a certain point (PNR), starved larvae cannot recover when refed and eventually die. Short delays in food availability affected the timing of development, not the ability to continue to develop, but after iong delays the larvae lost the ability to metamorphose. The PNR depends not only on the initial energy reserves of the embryo but also on the amount of energy needed to reach Cl which in turn depends on the effect of temperature on O2 consumption rates and developmental times. The PNR of 10-14 days from the food availability experiments was similar to the calculated PNR from metabolic requirements and known lipid reserves. The calculated PNR increased with increasing temperature, from 9 to 15 days within the environmental range. Despite the narrow temperature range in the Southern Ocean, both temperature and food availability will affect the survival and recruitment of the early larvae of E. superba. © 1989.",2-s2.0-0024944991

Oxygen consumption rates of known age embryos and early larvae were measured at 0 ° C and at partial pressures ranging from 90 to 0% of air saturation. Four of the five stages of embryos (single cell, multiple cell, gastrula, and limb bud) and the larval stages (Nauplius I, Nauplius II, Metanauplius, and Calyptopis 1, the first feeding stage) regulated their oxygen uptake down to 7.3 kPa. Younger stages of embryos and larvae were able to regulate oxygen uptake at lower partial pressures of oxygen than older stages. Embryos close to hatching (twitch) were not good regulators. The oxygen consumption rates of the developing embryos and larvae usually will be independent of the partial pressure of oxygen in the environment. The pattern of oxygen consumption with age was similar to that of many fish: a low respiration rate at fertilization, increasing slowly until the embryos hatch, then a sharp increase at hatching when the larvae begin to swim, with a two-fold variability between the oxygen consumption rates of larvae of the same stage and age determined in different experiments. Embryo metabolism was only 3.45% of the total metabolic demand of all the non-feeding stages. Thus, most of the lipid reserves can be passed on to the larvae for use during development to the first feeding stage. Only the larvae were used in experiments to determine the effect of temperature on oxygen consumption rates. Experimental temperatures were -1,0, and 2 ° C, spanning nearly the full range of temperatures that the larvae encounter in the environment during early development. The effect of temperature on oxygen consumption was not linear. Oxygen consumption rates for the same age or stage larvae at 0 and 2 ° C were the same, and much higher than those at -1 ° C. The metabolism-temperature response suggests that oxygen consumption rates are temperature independent for the Calyptopis 1 larvae in the surface waters, where temperatures are usually > 0 ° C during the summer when these larvae appear. © 1989.",2-s2.0-0024483373

The relationship between temperature and developmental times was curvilinear, with a sharp decrease in developmental time between -1 and 0°C, followed by a gradual flattening of the curve. The relationship was best described by the exponential model D = B0* e-B1(T) + B2, where D is developmental time in days, T is the temperature, and B0, B1, and B2 are fitted constants. In three of the four batches of larvae reared at -1°C, all larvae died within 3 days of metamorphosis to Calyptopis 1, while siblings at higher temperatures developed normally. These results suggests that a cold sensitive period exists during early larval development. The type of food available also affected the survival of three groups of siblings. Larvae fed a diatom mixture developed normally, while those fed a small flagellate or starved all died before metamorphosis to Calyptopis 2. The effects of temperature and food type on the development and survival of the early larval stages have important ecological implications for the recruitment of E. superba. If spawning occurs in areas where the embryos or larvae encounter subzero water during a temperature sensitive period, recruitment in these waters may be very low, independent of food availability. If the embryos and larvae do not encounter subzero water during a sensitive period, recruitment may be more dependent on the type and concentration of food available. © 1988.",2-s2.0-0024260465

This experimental study on the embryology of Euphausia superba was conducted at the Palmer Station, Antarctica during the 1982-1983 austral summer. The gravid females were captured from Bransfield Strait aboard the R/V Hero. The various embryological stages such as early cleavage, blastula, gastrula and limb-bud nauplius larva were defined and described. The duration for these various developmental stages at 1 atm was also established at +2°C and compared with the timing of this event at negative temperature. Krill embryonic development is inhibited at 4°C. The sinking rate of eggs and embryos was also measured at various pressure. The data suggest that pressure does not significantly influence the sinking rate. There appears to be a wide variation of sinking rates of eggs within the same brood. based on a simulated model of sinking rate, egg development was studied at increasing pressure. Pressure of 5-20 atm accelerates the rate of cleavage and therefore the 32-celled stage is attained within 5-8 h, while at 1 atm it took 13 h to reach the same stage. Pressure thus seems to have some influence on the duration of the development of different developmental stages of krill embryos. © 1985 Springer-Verlag.",2-s2.0-0012340361
