J	SIFERD, TD; CONOVER, RJ				SIFERD, TD; CONOVER, RJ			NATURAL-HISTORY OF CTENOPHORES IN THE RESOLUTE PASSAGE AREA OF THE CANADIAN HIGH ARCTIC WITH SPECIAL REFERENCE TO MERTENSIA-OVUM	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												The natural history of ctenophores from the Resolute Passage area of the Canadian High Arctic was examined in 1985 and 1986. The seasonal abundance of 3 ctenophore species, Mertensia ovum, Beroe cucumis, and Bolinopsis infundibulum, are reported. M ovum was by far the most abundant, accounting for 88.9 % of all ctenophores collected, and because of its abundance received the most study. The M ovum population developed similarly in both years reaching a maximum abundance of 911 m-2 in early June 1986. The lipofuscin age-pigment technique suggested that M ovum can live for at least 3 yr. Gut contents showed M ovum to be an opportunistic feeder, but the copepods Pseudocalanus acuspes, Calanus glacialis and C. hyperboreus and the amphipod Parathemisto libellula formed most of the diet. M ovum was estimated to consume between 4 and 10 % d-1 of the standing crop of macrozooplankton in Resolute Passage.																	0171-8630						1992	86	2					133	144		10.3354/meps086133							WOS:A1992JV40000004

At Becher-vaise Island, a nesting site in an East Antarctic population, Adelie penguin diving behaviour remains undocumented. This represents a key area of uncertainty in efforts to understand and predict foraging success at this colony. We compiled a multi-year telemetry dataset from time-depth recorders deployed from 1992 to 2004 on 64 birds at Bechervaise Island. We examined diving activity at multiple scales, ranging from foraging trips (n = 125) to dive bouts (n = 3461) to individual dives (n = 84 521), and then characterised the stage- and sex-specific variation in diving behaviour of chick-rearing Adelie penguins using linear mixed effect models. Total foraging trip effort (trip duration, number of dives, vertical distance travelled and number of wiggles [a proxy for prey ingestion]) substantially increased as the chick-rearing period progressed (guard through creche), consistent with increasing chick provisioning and self-maintenance requirements over time. Foraging activity was predominantly structured in periods of sustained diving bouts, indicating sustained foraging effort over the course of the foraging trip. Diving behaviour (dive-level depth, duration, bottom time and attempts of catch per unit effort) varied in relation to sex and chick-rearing stage. Dives were performed more frequently during high and low levels of solar light, which is likely linked to visual predation strategies or prey activity. Our findings advance our understanding of this population's foraging behaviour, which is ultimately required to underpin the conservation and management of this breeding colony.

Unrecognized Antarctic Biodiversity: A Case Study of the Genus Odontaster (Odontasteridae; Asteroidea)	INTEGRATIVE AND COMPARATIVE BIOLOGY					Annual Meeting of the Society-for-Integrative-and-Comparative-Biology	JAN 03-07, 2010	Seattle, WA	Soc Integrat & Comparat Biol				Antarctica has a complex and multifaceted geologic and oceanographic history that has influenced and shaped patterns of marine invertebrate diversity. This evolutionary history consists of major events on a wide range of time scales such as the formation of the Antarctic Polar Front (25-41 million years ago) to repeated glacial cycles during the past million years. These factors variably influenced genetic connectivity of fauna to produce a highly unique, but incredibly diverse marine community. Use of molecular phylogeographic methods is creating the need to revise our understanding of Antarctic patterns of biodiversity. In particular, almost every phylogeographic study carried out to date, suggests that the biodiversity of Antarctic marine shelf fauna is considerably underestimated. In discovering this diversity, some lineages (i.e., cryptic lineages) show no diagnostic morphological differences whereas others (i.e., unrecognized species) show differences that were unknown to science. The sea star genus Odontaster is among the best-studied of Antarctic invertebrate groups. Nonetheless, two unrecognized lineages were recently discovered along the Antarctic Peninsula, which is one of the best-studied regions in Antarctica. Herein, we elucidate the molecular and morphological uniqueness of these species and name them O. roseus and O. pearsei. The latter is in honor of John Pearse, an Antarctic biologist, as well as past President and long-time member of the Society of Integrative and Comparative Biology.

Bottom-moored free-vehicle acoustic instruments were used in concert with midwater trawls and baited traps to examine the abundance, size distribution and vertical distribution of pelagic organisms in the uppermost 100 m of the water column during the austral spring of 1992 in two areas of the northwestern Weddell Sea, one covered by seasonal pack ice and the other free of ice cover. Acoustic targets were more abundant and significantly larger at the open-water station than beneath pack ice. However, targets at the ice-covered site exhibited a pronounced diel pattern, with the largest targets detected only at night. Samples from night trawls at the ice-covered site contained several species of large, vertically-migrating mesopelagic fishes, whereas these species were absent from trawls taken during the day. In addition, baited traps deployed in pack ice just beneath the ice-water interface collected large numbers of scavenging lysianassoid amphipods, while deeper traps beneath the ice and traps at the open-water station were empty, indicating the presence of a scavenging community associated with the undersurface of the ice. These results support the idea that mesopelagic organisms migrate closer to the surface beneath pack ice than in open water, exposing them to possible predation by surface-foraging seabirds.																	0025-3162					DEC	1995	124	3					387	397		10.1007/BF00363912							WOS:A1995TM47100005

Sardines, anchovy, and Antarctic krill are suggested examples, and here we use locusts to explore whether the wasp-waist concept also applies on land. These examples also display the traits of mobile aggregations and dietary diversity, which help to reduce the foraging footprint from their large, localised biomasses. This suggests that top-down control on their food operates at local aggregation scales and not at wider scales suggested by the original definition of wasp-waist. With this modification, the wasp-waist framework can cross-fertilise marine and terrestrial approaches, revealing how seemingly disparate but economically important systems operate.

Cluster analysis and multi-dimensional scaling revealed 4 major groups of stations within each ordination that broadly corresponded geographically. A grouping of stations to the east of the Antarctic Peninsula was characterised by low phytoplankton cell counts. The corresponding grouping of stations in the mesozooplankton data were characterised by low abundance, overwintered state of many species, low egg production rates, and low carbon mass of copepod instars. In contrast, groupings of stations in the northern part of the Scotia Sea were characterised as chlorophyll and mesozooplankton rich, and the summer generation was well advanced. Latitude was most strongly correlated with mesozooplankton community pattern (rank correlation p = 0.608), whereas surface chlorophyll a was a weaker correlate (p = 0.344) but along with measures of size-fractioned chlorophyll contributed towards explaining variation in species stages carbon mass and egg production rates. Additional hauls to 1000 m with an LHPR indicated copepod populations were broadly in an overwintered state in the south of the region, whereas to the north of South Georgia recruitment had been completed and some species were undergoing a seasonal descent. A comparison with January/February 2000 revealed higher abundances of krill larvae throughout the Scotia Sea in 2000 as well as a more advanced generation of the copepod Calanoides acutus. Ice cover during the 2 years differed considerably; in 2000 the position of the summer ice edge broadly accorded with the 25 yr average, whereas in 2003 the ice edge lay much further north than usual. We suggest that the timing of ice retreat influenced the timing of reproduction with the late retreat in 2003 causing delayed reproduction and reduced population sizes.

J	Li, CL; Sun, S; Zhang, GT; Ji, P				Li, CL; Sun, S; Zhang, GT; Ji, P			Summer feeding activities of zooplankton in Prydz Bay, Antarctica	POLAR BIOLOGY												Grazing of dominant zooplankton copepods (Calanoides acutus. and Metridia gerlachei), salps (Salpa thompsoni) and microzooplankton was determined during the austral summer of 1998/1999 at the seasonal ice zone of the Prydz Bay region. The objective was to measure the ingestion rates of zooplankton at the seasonal ice zone, so as to evaluate the importance of different groups of zooplankton in their grazing impact on phytoplankton standing stock and primary production. Grazing by copepods was low, and accounted for less than or equal to 1% of phytoplankton standing stocks and 3.8-12.5% of primary production for both species during this study, even the ingestion rates of individuals were at a high level compared with previous reports. S. thompsoni exhibited a relatively high grazing impact on primary production (72%) in the north of our investigation area. The highest grazing impact on phytoplankton was exerted by microzooplankton during this investigation, and accounted for 10-65% of the standing stock of phytoplankton and 34-100% of potential daily primary production. We concluded that microzooplankton was the dominant phytoplankton consumer in this study area. Salps also played an important role in control of phytoplankton where swarming occurred. The grazing of copepods had a relatively small effect on phytoplankton biomass development.																	0722-4060					DEC	2001	24	12					892	900		10.1007/s003000100292							WOS:000172557500003

Myctophid Fish (Family Myctophidae) Are Central Consumers in the Food Web of the Scotia Sea (Southern Ocean)	FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE												Myctophids are the most abundant and diverse mesopelagic fishes in the Southern Ocean. They are a conduit of energy between primary consumers and higher marine predators, and between the surface layers and the mesopelagic depths. However, there remain major uncertainties about their ecology, particularly regarding their role in Southern Ocean food webs in waters south of the Antarctic Polar Front, which are often regarded as dominated by Antarctic krill. Limited data on the feeding ecology of myctophids has made it difficult to assess the importance of myctophids as consumers of krill and how they fit in the traditional view of a krill-dominated system (diatom-krill-higher predator). We provide a new assessment of the role of myctophids in Southern Ocean food webs using information from recent trophodynamic studies of myctophids conducted in the Scotia Sea, one of the most productive regions of the Southern Oce an and a region that sustains both major populations of higher predators (sea birds, seals, whales) and important commercial fisheries (krill, toothfish, and mackerel icefish). Collectively, these data show that myctophids have a central role in Southern Ocean food webs as both predators and prey. Large myctophid species are prevalent consumers of krill throughout their distributional range and in different seasons in the Scotia Sea. Moreover, best estimates of both myctophid and higher predator consumption of krill to date indicate that large myctophids are the greatest predators of krill in this region, consuming almost as much krill as do all other vertebrates. Nevertheless, there are several smaller myctophid species that do not eat krill, instead consuming copepods and other small euphausiids. Myctophids therefore link primary producers to higher predators through both krill-dependent and krill-independent trophic pathways, emphasizing their importance in regional food webs. Consequently, trophic pathways involving large myctophids are unlikely to be exempt from the direct consequences of projected redistribution and/or reduction in krill population biomass under scenarios of ocean-warming, whilst trophic pathways involving small myctophids may be more resilient to such effects and become increasingly important to higher trophic levels. Further studies are required to determine the extent to which myctophids can maintain food web stability and sustain higher predator populations during periods of prolonged reductions in krill abundance. Including knowledge of the role of myctophids in Southern Ocean food webs will be important for developing robust projections of the impacts of future change to inform decision making for conservation and management.

Temporal changes in abundances of large calanoid copepods in the Scotia Sea: comparing the 1930s with contemporary times	POLAR BIOLOGY												To investigate whether impacts of reported climate change in the Antarctic marine environment have affected mesozooplankton populations, we compared the summertime abundances of four species of large calanoid copepods from samples taken during the Discovery Investigations (1926-1938) and contemporary times (1996-2013). Discovery samples were obtained using an N70V closing net fished vertically through three depth horizons encompassing the top 250 m of the water column, whereas contemporary samples were obtained using a Bongo net fished vertically through 200-0 m. Data from a previous study comparing catch efficiencies of the two nets were used to generate calibration factors which were applied to the N70V abundances. Following further corrections for net depth differences and seasonal biases in sampling frequency, three of the four species, Calanoides acutus, Rhincalanus gigas and Calanus simillimus, were found to be between similar to 20-55% more abundant in contemporary times than they were 70 years ago. Calanus propinquus was marginally more abundant in the Discovery era. These results were robust to sensitivity analyses for the net calibration factor, seasonal bias and net depth corrections. Although near-surface ocean temperatures within the Scotia Sea have increased by up to 1.5 A degrees C during the last 70 years, we conclude that the most likely causes of increased copepod abundances are linked to changes in the food-web. In particular, we discuss the reported decrease in krill abundance in the South Atlantic that has potentially increased the amount of food available to copepods while at the same time decreasing predator pressure.

J	Tremblay, Y; Cherel, Y				Tremblay, Y; Cherel, Y			Benthic and pelagic dives: a new foraging behaviour in rockhopper penguins	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												The pattern and characteristics of diving of 55 daily foraging trips performed by 16 female southern rockhopper penguins Eudyptes chrysocome filholi were studied in coastal waters of Kerguelen Archipelago during the guard stage. Diving patterns and dive profiles indicated that birds used 2 foraging behaviours. First, they performed typical pelagic dives, as previously decribed for other penguin species. Second, they also performed series of consecutive square-wave dives reaching similar maximum depths, with no deeper dives within the series, all criteria which characterized benthic dives. Two groups of benthic and pelagic dives were subsequently selected to compare their parameters. In agreement with optimization concepts in foraging theory, rockhopper penguins maximize bottom time (= feeding time) of benthic dives through an increase in both descent and ascent rates, thus minimizing transit time between the sea surface and the bottom. Regardless of dive depth, bottom time was longer and diving efficiency higher in benthic dives than in pelagic ones. Penguins were also more active during benthic dives, as indicated by higher numbers of depth and light wiggles at the bottom of these dives. Bathymetry and dive depth indicate that penguins were able to reach about 80 % of the sea floor surrounding the colony. Abrupt changes in dive depth within series of benthic dives were identical in height to the thickness of lava flows, the main geological features of the landscape, strongly suggesting that birds followed the bottom topography at a fine scale. Dietary analysis showed that rockhopper penguins fed upon benthic prey (a few fish and the mysid Mysidetes morbihanensis) and pelagic organisms, including the major item Euphausia vallentini. There was a positive linear relationship between the mass of food brought ashore and an index of the proportion of benthic dives during the daily trips, thus emphasizing the importance for rockhopper penguins living in a coastal marine environment of feeding on pelagic migrators trapped at or near the sea floor during the day.																	0171-8630						2000	204						257	267		10.3354/meps204257							WOS:000089943900021

This study aimed to evaluate driving factors, namely feeding areas, trophic level, and sex, affecting POP concentrations in the blubber of humpback whales breeding off Mozambique and off Ecuador. Biopsies of free-ranging humpback whales including blubber and skin were collected in 2014 and 2015 from Ecuador (n = 59) and in 2017 from Mozambique (n = 89). In both populations, HCB was the major contaminant followed by DDTs > CHLs > PCBs > HCHs > PBDEs. POP concentrations were significantly higher in males compared to females. HCB, DDTs, HCHs and PBDEs were significantly different between whales from the Mozambique population and the Ecuador population. Sex and feeding habits were important driving factors accounting for POP concentrations in Ecuador whales. The whales from our study had some of the lowest POP concentrations measured for humpback whales in the world. These whales fed predominantly on krill as reflected from the low delta C-13 and delta N-15 values measured in the skin. However, the isotopic niches of whales from Mozambique and Ecuador did not overlap indicating that the two populations are feeding in different areas of the Southern Ocean. (c) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Trophic position and foraging ecology of Ross, Weddell, and crabeater seals revealed by compound-specific isotope analysis	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												Ross seals Ommatophoca rossii are one of the least studied marine mammals, with little known about their foraging ecology. Research to date using bulk stable isotope analysis suggests that Ross seals have a trophic position intermediate between that of Weddell Leptonychotes weddellii and crabeater Lobodon carcinophaga seals. However, consumer bulk stable isotope values not only reflect trophic dynamics, but also variations in baseline isotope values, which can be substantial. We used compound-specific isotope analysis of amino acids (CSI-AA) to separate isotopic effects of a shifting baseline versus trophic structure on the foraging ecology of these ecologically important Antarctic pinnipeds. We found that Ross seals forage in an open ocean food web, while crabeater and Weddell seals forage within similar food webs closer to shore. However, isotopic evidence suggests that crabeater seals are likely following sea ice, while Weddell seals target productive areas of the continental shelf of West Antarctica. Our CSI-AA data indicate that Ross seals have a high trophic position equivalent to that of Weddell seals, contrary to prior conclusions from nitrogen isotope results on bulk tissues. CSI-AA indicates that crabeater seals are at a trophic position lower than that of Ross and Weddell seals, consistent with a krill-dominated diet. Our results redefine the view of the trophic dynamics and foraging ecology of the Ross seal, and also highlight the importance of quantifying baseline isotope variations in foraging studies.

Pelagic Iron Recycling in the Southern Ocean: Exploring the Contribution of Marine Animals	FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE												The availability of iron controls primary productivity in large areas of the Southern Ocean. Iron is largely supplied via atmospheric dust deposition, melting ice, the weathering of shelf sediments, upwelling, sediment resuspension, mixing (deep water, biogenic, and vertical mixing) and hydrothermal vents with varying degrees of temporal and spatial importance. However, large areas of the Southern Ocean are remote from these sources, leading to regions of low primary productivity. Recent studies suggest that recycling of iron by animals in the surface layer could enhance primary productivity in the Southern Ocean. The aim of this review is to provide a quantitative and qualitative assessment of the current literature on pelagic iron recycling by marine animals in the Southern Ocean and highlight the next steps forward in quantifying the retention and recycling of iron by higher trophic levels in the Southern Ocean. Phytoplankton utilize the iron in seawater to meet their metabolic demand. Through grazing, pelagic herbivores transfer the iron in phytoplankton cells into their body tissues and organs. Herbivores can recycle iron through inefficient feeding behavior that release iron into the water before ingestion, and through the release of fecal pellets. The iron stored within herbivores is transferred to higher trophic levels when they are consumed. When predators consume iron beyond their metabolic demand it is either excreted or defecated. Waste products from pelagic vertebrates can thus contain high concentrations of iron which may be in a form that is available to phytoplankton. Bioavailability of fecal iron for phytoplankton growth is influenced by a combination of the size of the fecal particle, presence of organic ligands, the oxidation state of the iron, as well as biological (e.g., remineralization, coprochaly, coprorhexy, and coprophagy) and physical (e.g., dissolution, fragmentation) processes that lead to the degradation and release of fecal iron. The flux of dissolved iron from pelagic recycling is comparable to other sources in the region such as atmospheric dust, vertical diffusivity, vertical flux, lateral flux and upwelling, but lower than sea ice, icebergs, sediment resuspension, and deep winter mixing.

At-sea behaviour of three krill predators breeding at Bouvetoya-Antarctic fur seals, macaroni penguins and chinstrap penguins	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												Interspecific competition is an important structuring element in marine ecosystems, especially in the Southern Ocean which offers few prey choices to comparatively large predator populations. We present the first simultaneous observations of at-sea behaviour and attendance patterns of 3 synchronously breeding, central place, krill foragers at Bouvetoya-a small, isolated, sub-Antarctic island in the South Atlantic. Time depth recorders and satellite transmitters were deployed during the austral summer of 2007/2008 on 47 lactating Antarctic fur seals Arctocephalus gazella (AFS) rearing pups and on 20 macaroni Eudyptes chrysolophus (MAC) and 30 chinstrap Pygoscelis antarctica penguins (CHIN) rearing chicks. All 3 species showed a strong preference for the west side of the island, and their foraging ranges overlapped markedly. Solar elevation influenced the timing of departures from, and arrivals to, the island with markedly different patterns between the seals and the penguins. Diving patterns also showed significant differences among the 3 species, with the frequency of diving being higher at night for the AFS, while both penguin species dove more frequently during the day. But a common, vertical diel pattern occurred in all 3 species, with shallow diving occurring at night and deep diving during the day, consistent with the vertical migration of krill. MACs targeted 2 depth layers for feeding, including a deep prey layer at similar to 70 m, which was not exploited by AFSs and CHINs. The results suggest that there is potential for competitive overlap among these 3 krill predators at Bouvetoya, but that it is reduced via both spatial (horizontal and vertical) and temporal partitioning of foraging areas.

These include the congeneric Adelie, chinstrap and gentoo penguins, which now demonstrate remarkable population responses to regional warming. However, inconsistencies in the direction of population changes between species at different study sites complicate the understanding of causal processes. Here, we show that at the South Orkney Islands where the three species breed sympatrically, the less ice-adapted gentoo penguins increased significantly in numbers over the last 26 years, whereas chinstrap and Adelie penguins both declined. These trends occurred in parallel with regional long-term warming and significant reduction in sea ice extent. Periodical warm events, with teleconnections to the tropical Pacific, caused cycles in sea ice leading to reduced prey biomass, and simultaneous interannual population decreases in the three penguin species. With the loss of sea ice, Adelie penguins were less buffered against the environment, their numbers fluctuated greatly and their population response was strong and linear. Chinstrap penguins, considered to be better adapted to ice-free conditions, were affected by discrete events of locally increased ice cover, but showed less variable, nonlinear responses to sea ice loss. Gentoo penguins were temporarily affected by negative anomalies in regional sea ice, but persistent sea ice reductions were likely to increase their available niche, which is likely to be substantially segregated from that of their more abundant congeners. Thus, the regional consequences of global climate perturbations on the sea ice phenology affect the marine ecosystem, with repercussions for penguin food supply and competition for resources. Ultimately, variability in penguin populations with warming reflects the local balance between penguin adaptation to ice conditions and trophic-mediated changes cascading from global climate forcing.																	1354-1013	1365-2486				MAR	2006	12	3					411	423		10.1111/j.1365-2486.2006.01108.x							WOS:000236023000001

Sampling was performed during summer 1997 off the coast of the western Antarctic Peninsula between Anvers Island and Marguerite Bay. Phytoplankton was characterized by relatively low biomass throughout most of the study area and was dominated by nanoalgae (<20 mum). Phytoplankton varied along an on-offshore gradient, with decreasing total cell abundance, chlorophyll a (chl a) concentration and carbon biomass toward the open ocean. Chl a concentration showed surface or subsurface maxima in coastal and middle-shelf waters, and deep maxima between similar to40 and 100 m in oceanic waters. Across-shelf variability in phytoplankton correlated with vertical stability in the water column, which appears to be the major parameter affecting phytoplankton community structure in the area. We hypothesize that the deep chl a maximum offshore may be associated with iron limitation in near-surf ace waters and higher iron concentration in 'winter waters' (subsurface remnant of Antarctic Surface Waters). On a smaller spatial scale, a cluster analysis showed great regional variability in phytoplankton assemblages. The area was divided into 4 main regions based on differences in the phytoplankton composition and concentration. Three peaks in phytoplankton abundance were found on a north-to-south gradient in near-shore waters: a Cryptomonas spp. bloom near Anvers Island, a small unidentified phytoflagellate bloom in Grandidier Channel, and a diatom bloom in Marguerite Bay. These assemblages resemble different stages of the phytoplankton seasonal succession, and may be related to the progressive sea-ice retreat, which might have regulated the timing of the onset of the phytoplankton seasonal succession in a north-south gradient. Biological environmental factors, such as seeding of the water column by epontic algae and selective zooplankton herbivory, are hypothesized to affect community composition in coastal regions. We conclude that large-scale variability in phytoplankton community structure is related to water column physical conditions and possibly iron availability, while mesoscale variability, as seen in coastal waters, is more likely due to seasonal succession of different algae groups.																	0171-8630	1616-1599					2003	261						21	39		10.3354/meps261021							WOS:000186704400002

Although the density of B, arctica was higher during daytime in the water column between 0.1 and 1.5 m above the sea floor, no significant changes in day-night density were recorded. Feeding peaks were detected during 2 consecutive days in the morning (between 09:59 and 11:58 h), while during the evening and night (between 16:09 and 01:28 h), feeding intensity decreased. The R obtained from field data (R-max) was 0.114 h(-1), whereas the R obtained from experimentally starved specimens collected during Cruise BBC1 of March 1998 varied between 0.141 h(-1) (3 specimens) and 0.345 h(-1) (1 specimen). The DR calculated with Elliott and Persson model ranged from 13.51 to 15.05 % dry wt for R of 0.114 h(-1) and R 0.141 h(-1), respectively. The DR obtained for B. arctica was higher than the range of DR reported for megafaunal deep-sea decapod crustaceans in the same area (between 0.260 and 4.820 % dry wt), but fell within the DR range reported for pelagic zooplankton (euphausiids, hyperiids, calanoids). Adopting 0.6 g C m(-2) as the mean annual organic carbon consumption of the sediment community from the neigbouring Lacaze-Duthier canyon (north Catalan Sea), B, arctica would consume ca 3.4% of organic carbon annually. Therefore, the trophic impact of this bathyal species is low compared to its numerical dominance in bathyal assemblages, and is often lower than that reported for mesopelagic species.

J	SHEEHY, MRJ; ROBERTS, BE				SHEEHY, MRJ; ROBERTS, BE			AN ALTERNATIVE EXPLANATION FOR ANOMALIES IN SOLUBLE LIPOFUSCIN FLUORESCENCE DATA FROM INSECTS, CRUSTACEANS, AND OTHER AQUATIC SPECIES	EXPERIMENTAL GERONTOLOGY												Published attempts to extract lipofuscin from crustaceans and fish to assess age for fisheries research purposes have used essentially the same extraction methodology applied to insects, but have neither shown a conclusive age-dependence of spectrally similar fluorescence nor proved its association with lipofuscin. The reported lipofuscin solvent extraction method for fleshflies, Sarcophaga bullata, was manipulated by varying wash volume. This revealed that almost all age-dependent blue fluorescent material persisting in lipid fractions was actually pteridine-like. This finding was consistent with some previous independent results for Musca domestica. Examination of reported lipofuscin extraction protocols for other insects suggested that this problem was probably widespread. The pteridines are known to occur in unusually high amounts in insects, accumulating with age specifically in some members of this group by storage excretion, probably as a terrestrial water conservation strategy. In addition, there is growing evidence in the gerontological literature for other groups that solvent extracted blue fluorescence is not a true measure of lipofuscin content in tissues. These findings provide considerable insight into anomalies in putative lipofuscin fluorescence data between the insects and various aquatic species and suggest that there may be little basis for expectations of age-dependent fluorescence from aquatic species when the same gross extraction and crude purification methods are used.																	0531-5565	1873-6815					1991	26	5					495	509		10.1016/0531-5565(91)90038-N							WOS:A1991GL10200012	1756781

Intense deposition and rapid processing of seafloor phytodetritus in a glaciomarine fjord, Andvord Bay (Antarctica)	PROGRESS IN OCEANOGRAPHY												The West Antarctic Peninsula (WAP) region encompasses numerous fjords known to be hotspots of benthic biodiversity and biomass. These ecosystems are undergoing rapid climate warming and oceanographic change; consequent glacial melt and retreat may dramatically alter benthic communities and ecosystem functions in WAP fjords. In addition, there is extreme variability in seasonal productivity and phytodetrital food input to the deep shelf benthos of the WAP. Here we document the flux and utilization of phytodetritus at 530 m depth in Andvord Bay, a WAP glaciomarine fjord, using seafloor time-lapse images spanning a 10-month period, from December 2015 to September 2016. To explore the relationship between sea-surface conditions and detrital export, we developed a color-based method to quantify seafloor phytodetritus cover in time-lapse images, and correlated phytodetritus cover with sea-ice cover and surface wind speed. During the most rapid period of phytodetritus accumulation in early January 2016, approximately 3 cm of phytodetritus was deposited on the fjord floor over six days, representing a large input of organic carbon to the benthos. The timing of this rapid export event was not related to overlying wind conditions and occurred when the fjord was ice-free. To assess the response of the megafaunal community, we measured fecal-pellet production by the dominant surface depositfeeder, the ampharetid polychaete Amythas membranifera. The deposit-feeding rate of A. membranifera increased substantially during high seafloor phytodetritus cover and returned to background levels for the rest of the autumn and winter. Ampharetids and mobile megafauna were observed to feed throughout the entire timeseries, including beneath winter sea ice, suggesting that the delivery of phytodetritus from surface phytoplankton blooms in spring/summer sustains these abundant populations year-round with a sediment food bank. A. membranifera can reach densities of > 37 m(-2) and, as a population, processes a volume equivalent to the top 1.05 cm of sediment annually. The maximum individual feeding rates measured are comparable to some temperate intertidal deposit feeders. Nonetheless, phytodetritus on 31-73% of the seafloor was consumed by macrofauna or microbial populations not visible in time-lapse photographs, suggesting that recently deposited phytodetritus is processed primarily by these smaller size classes. This study demonstrates the seasonal coupling and subsequent decoupling of detritivore activity in response to a massive detrital deposition event in a deep, subpolar WAP fjord. This work indicates that both megafaunal deposit feeders and smaller size classes play important roles in processing labile organic matter in WAP fjord ecosystems.

Estimating juvenile copepod growth rates: corrections, inter-comparisons and recommendations	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												The 2 most common experimental methods used to estimate rates of juvenile growth in marine copepods are the molt rate (MR) method, and the artificial cohort (AC) method. Recently, we showed the equations used in the MR method to be incorrect, and proposed a modified molt rate (MMR) method. Here, using statistical and model approaches, we compare the AC and MMR methods under various scenarios to quantify their errors. Although the AC and MMR methods both use a combination of field sampling and simulated in situ incubations to estimate somatic growth, they differ in several important characteristics. The AC method determines growth by the change in mean weight during incubation. Mean weight of copepods in the samples can be determined directly, or inferred from mean weight by life stage or from length-weight regressions. We show that substantial error is avoided only if weights are measured directly (AC(direct)). The AC(direct) method is insensitive to variable age within stage due to mortality or variable recruitment in the sampled population, an important advantage over the MMR method. However, the ACdirect method is sensitive to variation in growth rate (luring incubation, which does not affect the MMR method. We therefore recommend that most experimental estimates of growth rate should apply the ACdi,,ct method, with the MMR as a suitable alternative provided its biases are considered. An indirect method based on life stage is biased and we no longer recommend it, and an indirect method based on length-weight regression provides an intermediate level of bias.

The flow of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) is largely zonal upstream of the Kerguelen Plateau. The southern branch of the Polar Front and the northern branch of the southern ACC front (SACCF) are deflected to the north by the topography and cross the plateau through the Fawn Trough. The southern branch of the SACCF and the southern boundary of the ACC pass to the south of Banzare Bank, through the Princess Elizabeth Trough. These fronts turn sharply to the north on the eastern flank of the plateau, then retroflect to the south before continuing eastward. Satellite altimetry and float trajectories suggest the ACC regime to the east of the plateau is eddy-rich and characterised by extensive meandering of the ACC fronts, in contrast to the low eddy energy and zonal flow observed west of the plateau. The Antarctic Slope Current flows west along the upper continental slope, with hydrographic data indicating some of the flow turns offshore and feeds the Southern Boundary flow in the Western Boundary Current. Flow over the plateau itself is relatively quiescent and floats in this region have a long residence time ( > 1 year). The regional circulation is closely associated with the distribution of biological productivity in surface waters, as revealed in satellite measurements of ocean colour, including high productivity in subpolar waters, along the eastern edge of the plateau and over the Antarctic continental shelf, moderate productivity over the plateau, and low productivity in ACC waters in the Fawn Trough and north of the SACCF.				van Wijk, Esmee/AAB-2451-2020; Bestley, Sophie/AAN-2483-2021; Rintoul, Stephen/A-1471-2012	van Wijk, Esmee/0000-0002-9375-4383; Bestley, Sophie/0000-0001-9342-669X; Corney, Stuart/0000-0002-8293-0863; Rintoul, Stephen/0000-0002-7055-9876												0967-0645	1879-0100				APR	2020	174				SI				104479	10.1016/j.dsr2.2018.07.013							WOS:000539111000002

We conducted discrete depth sampling to clarify the community structure of copepods from the epi- to bathypelagic layers of the oceanic and neritic waters off Adelie and George V Land, East Antarctica, in the austral summer of 2008. Notably high diversity and species numbers were observed in the meso- and bathypelagic layers. Cluster analysis based on the similarity of copepod communities identified seven cluster groups, which corresponded well with water masses. In the epi- and upper- mesopelagic layers of the oceanic zone, the SB (Southern Boundary of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current) divided copepod communities. Conversely, in the lower meso- and bathypelagic layers (500-2000 m depth), communities were consistent across the SB. In these layers, the distributions of copepod species were separated by habitat depth ranges and feeding behaviour. The different food webs occur in the epipelagic layer with habitat segregation by zooplankton in their horizontal distribution ranges. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. and NIPR. All rights reserved.

Ingestion rates and grazing impact of the brackwater mussel Brachidontes virgiliae in Lake St Lucia, iSimangaliso Wetland Park, South Africa	AFRICAN JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE												Bivalves feed on a combination of phytoplankton and zooplankton and have the potential to impact considerably the planktonic biomass, especially when they occur in high densities, such as in oyster and mussel beds. The brackwater mussel Brachidontes virgiliae is numerically dominant during wet phases within Africa's largest estuarine lake, St Lucia, in the iSimangaliso Wetland Park on the east coast of South Africa. The ingestion rates and potential grazing impact of this small mussel (maximum shell length = 2.5 cm) were estimated for both the wet and dry seasons using an in situ gut fluorescence technique. Ingestion rates were higher during the wet season (5.78 mu g pigment ind.(-1) d(-1)) than during the dry season (4.44 mu g pigment ind.(-1) d(-1)). This might be explained by the increased water temperature and food availability during the wet season. Because of the patchy distribution of mussel populations, there could be higher localised grazing impact near mussel aggregations. Results showed a potential grazing impact of up to 20 times the available phytoplankton biomass at specific sites. These high grazing impacts have the potential to deplete phytoplankton stocks in the lake, especially during wet phases in the northern reaches, where mussel densities are highest. This needs to be factored into ecological models of Lake St Lucia, because the system might function differently during increased flood events.

Abundance and distribution of invertebrate larvae in the Bellingshausen Sea (West Antarctica)	POLAR BIOLOGY												The central part of the Bellingshausen Sea has been poorly studied, partly because of the presence of ice during most of the year. The main aim of this study was to analyse the abundance and distribution of meroplankton, and the influence of oceanographic properties were investigated in the Bellingshausen Sea (West Antarctica) during the BENTART-06 cruise carried out in January-February 2006. Zooplankton samples were collected with a 80-mu m mesh plankton net hauled vertically from a depth of 200 m to the surface at fifteen stations across the Bellingshausen Sea. Fifteen types of larval benthic invertebrates were found, with echinospira and nudibranch veligers being the most abundant. Hierarchical analysis and non-metric multidimensional scaling revealed a high degree of spatial variability in both larval abundance and larval types across the Bellingshausen Sea. The variability was significantly correlated with total chlorophyll-a and the contribution of large (> 5 mu m) phytoplankton to total chlorophyll, indicating the availability of food as an important factor determining the larval distribution observed. Nudibranch veligers, nemertean pilidia, echinoderm and planula larvae were more abundant at stations in the central Bellingshausen Sea, which was characterized by low phytoplankton biomass and production. Higher abundances of echinospira veligers and polychaete larvae were found at the more productive stations close to Peter I Island and the Antarctic Peninsula. The abundance and diversity of larval types found in the Bellingshausen Sea during the BENTART-06 cruise support the hypothesis that indirect development through larval swimming stages plays a key role in benthic recruitment in polar areas.

Environmental forcing and Southern Ocean marine predator populations: effects of climate change and variability	PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES												The Southern Ocean is a major component within the global ocean and climate system and potentially the location where the most rapid climate change is most likely to happen, particularly in the high-latitude polar regions. In these regions, even small temperature changes can potentially lead to major environmental perturbations. Climate change is likely to be regional and may be expressed in various ways, including alterations to climate and weather patterns across a variety of time-scales that include changes to the long interdecadal background signals such as the development of the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). Oscillating climate signals such as ENSO potentially provide a unique opportunity to explore how biological communities respond to change. This approach is based on the premise that biological responses to shorter-term sub-decadal climate variability signals are potentially the best predictor of biological responses over longer time-scales. Around the Southern Ocean, marine predator populations show periodicity in breeding performance and productivity, with relationships with the environment driven by physical forcing from the ENSO region in the Pacific. Wherever examined, these relationships are congruent with mid-trophic-level processes that are also correlated with environmental variability. The short-term changes to ecosystem structure and function observed during ENSO events herald potential long-term changes that may ensue following regional climate change. For example, in the South Atlantic, failure of Antarctic krill recruitment will inevitably foreshadow recruitment failures in a range of higher trophic-level marine predators. Where predator species are not able to accommodate by switching to other prey species, population-level changes will follow. The Southern Ocean, though oceano-graphically interconnected, is not a single ecosystem and different areas are dominated by different food webs. Where species occupy different positions in different regional food webs, there is the potential to make predictions about future change scenarios.																	0962-8436	1471-2970				DEC 29	2007	362	1488					2351	2365		10.1098/rstb.2006.1953							WOS:000250644100011	17553770

We combine satellite images and citizen science to model habitat suitability for crabeater seals (Lobodon carcinophaga) throughout the Weddell Sea. Location Weddell Sea, Antarctica. Methods High-resolution satellite images covering 18,219 km(2)of the Weddell Sea during crabeater seal breeding season (October-November) were hosted on the crowd-sourcing platform Tomnod (DigitalGlobe). Citizen scientists marked "maps" where seals were present/absent and these votes were compared with the votes of an experienced observer. Correction factors were used to correct votes to either a continuous probability of seal presence, or a binary seal presence/absence value. We modelled probability of seal presence using ensemble models of Random Forests (RF), Boosted Regression Trees (BRT) and Support Vector Machines (SVM), and used fitted Maxent models to model seal presence/absence data. Results Model predictive power was low (RF:R-2 = 0.076 +/- 0.002: BRT:R-2 = 0.086 +/- 0.0008; SVM:R-2 = 0.082 +/- 0.003) to average (Maxent: AUC = 0.71 +/- 0.004). Distance to the ice edge and bathymetry were the most important variables that influenced crabeater seal distribution. Main conclusions Crabeater seals were more likely to be present over abyssal water, which coincides with typical adult Antarctic krill habitat - crabeater seal preferred prey. Where ice concentrations were more variable, that is more accessible, crabeater seals were also more likely to occur. Results agreed with the known ecology of crabeaters seals and the abundance, distribution and ecology of Antarctic krill. We were able to survey the largest area ever surveyed in the Weddell Sea and provide a model to assist furthering policy around the proposed protected area.

We tested the hypothesis that recent declines in the recruitment of a number of spiny lobster populations in different parts of the world are the result of increasing coastal water temperatures that deplete the metabolic reserves of recently settled post-larvae. We examined the resilience of recently settled juvenile lobsters to the depletion of their reserves in 2 species of spiny lobster from temperate waters. Juveniles of Jasus edwardsii survived on average (+/- SE) for 34.44 +/- 3.44 d without feeding at 19-21 degrees C, while Sagmariasus verreauxi survived for 39.96 +/- 1.40 d, with no differences in survival among 3 temperature regimes (17, 20 and 23 degrees C). The point of no return for recently-settled juveniles of S. verreauxi was estimated to be 30.40 +/- 13.50 d, which was close to their average survival under starvation conditions. Starved juvenile lobsters close to the point of no return with extremely low remaining protein and lipid (6.52% lipid and 27.18% protein of dry body mass) were capable of surviving once food was supplied. These results indicate that newly settled juveniles of spiny lobsters from temperate waters can endure adverse nutritional conditions over a wide range of thermal conditions for prolonged periods, making them resilient to future increases in water temperatures as a result of climate change.																	0171-8630	1616-1599				JUL 30	2019	623						39	50		10.3354/meps13006							WOS:000485736900004

Climate change and the marine ecosystem of the western Antarctic Peninsula	PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES												The Antarctic Peninsula is experiencing one of the fastest rates of regional climate change on Earth, resulting in the collapse of ice shelves, the retreat of glaciers and the exposure of new terrestrial habitat. In the nearby oceanic system, winter sea ice in the Bellingshausen and Amundsen seas has decreased in extent by 10% per decade, and shortened in seasonal duration. Surface waters have warmed by more than 1 K since the 1950s, and the Circumpolar Deep Water (CDW) of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current has also warmed. Of the changes observed in the marine ecosystem of the western Antarctic Peninsula (WAP) region to date, alterations in winter sea ice dynamics are the most likely to have had a direct impact on the marine fauna, principally through shifts in the extent and timing of habitat for ice-associated biota. Warming of seawater at depths below ca 100 m has yet to reach the levels that are biologically significant. Continued warming, or a change in the frequency of the flooding of CDW onto the WAP continental shelf may, however, induce sublethal effects that influence ecological interactions and hence food-web operation. The best evidence for recent changes in the ecosystem may come from organisms which record aspects of their population dynamics in their skeleton (such as molluscs or brachiopods) or where ecological interactions are preserved (such as in encrusting biota of hard substrata). In addition, a southwards shift of marine isotherms may induce a parallel migration of some taxa similar to that observed on land. The complexity of the Southern Ocean food web and the nonlinear nature of many interactions mean that predictions based on short-term studies of a small number of species are likely to be misleading.

After the termination of a previous study, broodstock from the experimental lots fed on raw fish, moist pellets and soft-dry pellets were separately kept on a commercial SDP for about 5 months. Thereafter, the fish which had been fed entirely on SDP were offered a test diet without krill meal supplementation; whereas broodstock which had been fed moist pellets or raw fish were fed test diets containing 20 and 30% krill meal, respectively; all for about 5 months prior to spawning. The total egg production, the hatching rate among the fertilized eggs and the rate of normal larvae were the highest in the eggs obtained from the brood fish fed SDP without krill meal supplementation; these figures decreased relatively with the increase of krill meal in the diets. The rates of buoyant and fertilized eggs among the total eggs produced were not markedly different. It appears that higher levels of krill meal in the SDP was not beneficial for yellowtail brood fish.

Lagrangian simulation of transport pathways and residence times along the western Antarctic Peninsula	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY												The relative contribution of ocean circulation in producing areas where marine mammals and other predators concentrate to produce biological hot spots along the continental shelf of the western Antarctic Peninsula (wAP) was investigated with numerical Lagrangian particle tracking simulations. Circulation distributions used in the Lagrangian simulations were obtained from the Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS) configured for the wAP region, with a horizontal resolution of 4 km and a vertical resolution of 24 sigma-layers. To determine release points for the floats, the simulated circulation fields were first analyzed to estimate scales of temporal variability. The temporal decorrelation scales of the simulated surface flow over most of the wAP shelf were 2-3 days. However, decorrelation scales of about 40 days were found for the surface flow in the southern part of Marguerite Bay. Temporal decorrelation scales for the flow below the permanent pycnocline at the depth of Circumpolar Deep Water (CDW) intrusions (below 250 m) were between 40 and 70 days along the northern flank of Marguerite Trough and extending into Marguerite Bay. Near Adelaide Island, Anvers Island and the offshore side of Alexander Island, the velocity decorrelation scales varied between 40 and 60 days. Floats were released in the wAP simulated circulation fields along the outer and mid-shelf at a range of depths in different seasons. The simulated particle trajectories showed preferred sites for across-shelf transport, with Marguerite Trough being a primary pathway for movement of floats into Marguerite Bay, Crystal Sound and the inner shelf region. The three primary biological hot spots, Crystal Sound, Laubeuf Fjord, and off Alexander Island, were sites with the longest particle residence times, being 18-27 days for Alexander Island and Crystal Sound to almost 35 days for Laubeuf Fjord. However, the source regions and circulation processes that provided the input of particles differed for each site. The Lagrangian particle tracking results showed the importance of the circulation in developing localized biological hot spots along the wAP, perhaps by facilitating aggregation of planktonic prey.

Using empirical orthogonal function analysis and k-means classification, we classified the study area into eight regions, which were in good accordance with the oceanographic and topographic features Examination of the chlorophyll-a time series in each region revealed that contrary to our expectation, regular seasonal phytoplankton blooms were observed only in a limited area. Of the eight regions, only two showed typical seasonal blooms, and one showed weak seasonality, whereas other regions exhibited irregular seasonal blooms of variable duration We attribute the absence of regularity in seasonal blooms to relatively shallow winter mixing, which would prevent entrainment of limiting micronutrients such as iron and silicate In the southwest Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean, topographic effects and sea ice may be the most important factors controlling primary productivity In the South Georgia region, chlorophyll-a showed a significant correlation with geostrophic current velocity, indicating that topographic effects depend on the interaction of current strength and topographic structure. Interannual variability of the surface chlorophyll in some regions also revealed longer periodicity (similar to 6 years) The periodicity seemed to be related to El Nino-Southern Oscillation and to sea-ice dynamics influenced by the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved.

A 50-year retrospective of persistent organic pollutants in the fat and eggs of penguins of the Southern Ocean	ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION												Persistent organic pollutants (POPS) such as dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethanes (DDTs), hexachlorobenzene (HCB), hexachlorocyclohexanes (HCHs), and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) have been spreading to Antarctica for over half a century. Penguins are effective indicators of pelagic concentrations of POPs. We synthesized the literature on penguins to assess temporal trends of pelagic contamination in Antarctica, using fat and eggs to monitor changes from 1964 to 2011. DDT/DDE ratios suggest long-range atmospheric transport. Average DDT in fat (ww) increased from 44 ng g(-1), in the 1960s, peaked at 171 ng g(-1) in the mid-1980s, and then declined slowly to the present level of 101 ng g(-1). Temporal trends in HCB contamination rose into the 1990s before declining. Sigma HCHs in fat was similar to 5 ng g(-1) from 1960 to 1979, peaking at 33 ng g(-1) during the period 1980-1989 before declining to similar to 5 ng g(-1), from 1990 to present. PCBs rose substantially from 1970 to 2009 in fat, varying more than DDTs and HCB in both fat and eggs. Antarctic penguins are good biological indicators of global DDT and HCB emissions, but the existing data are insufficient regarding HCHs and PCBs. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

These two enzyme activities accounted for 75-83% of the proteolytic activity of gut contents.

Mesozooplankton biomass and indices of grazing and metabolic activity in Antarctic waters	POLAR BIOLOGY												Mesozooplankton abundance, body area spectrum, biomass, gut fluorescence and electron transfer system (ETS) activity were studied in the Antarctic Peninsula during the post-bloom scenario in these waters. Values of abundance and biomass were rather low and decreased sharply from the slope waters to the coastal area. In contrast, specific gut fluorescence and ETS activity were high in the coastal area and decreased through the shelf-break. Large copepods were very scarce, similarly to the post-bloom conditions in phytoplankton where large cells are not abundant and small cells such as flagellates dominate the water column. The vertical distribution showed two well defined layers by day, one at the surface which corresponded to krill organisms and a second at depth (> 300 m) formed mainly by the large copepod Metridia gerlachei. During the short night, this layer ascended at the time that krill at the surface migrated to deeper waters as observed from acoustics and net sampling. This observation and the absence of large copepods over the shelf suggest that krill consumption on large phytoplankton cells during the bloom is followed by an increase in predation upon mesozooplankton. It also suggests that krill decrease the abundance and biomass of mesozooplankton over the shelf and continues their predation upon mesopelagic copepods during the post-bloom in Antarctic waters. This behaviour could explain the long ago described impoverishment in mesozooplankton south of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current.

Comparing acoustic classification methods to estimate krill biomass in the Georges Bank region from 1999 to 2012	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY-METHODS												Krill are a critical component of northern-latitude ecosystems, yet are poorly monitored in the Gulf of Maine and Georges Bank regions of the northeast United States continental shelf. We applied five acoustic classification methods (multifrequency single-beam index [MFSBI], dB-differencing, multifrequency index [MFI], and two variations of the Z-score method) to acoustic data collected during surveys conducted annually in the Georges Bank region in order to map krill spatial distribution from 1999 to 2012. Material properties (sound speed and mass density) of krill and length data from net samples collected in the Gulf of Maine and Georges Bank regions were used in conjunction with distorted wave Born approximation (DWBA) predicted target strengths to scale acoustic data to estimates of biomass for the Georges Bank region. All methods require a priori information, ranging from training sets (i.e., empirically based classification) to validated acoustic models of target strength (i.e., theoretically based classification) for the species and acoustic frequencies of interest. Incorporating predicted backscatter from theoretical models can improve confidence in classification, especially when clean training sets are not available, but does come at the cost of a validated acoustic backscatter model. The biomass estimates from the four acoustic classification methods were comparable among each other, with the MFSBI method consistently estimating lowest biomass and the empirically based Z-score consistently estimating highest biomass. Comparisons to net-based estimates were inconsistent, most likely due to net inefficiency (low catchability), targeting of layers, and scaling point estimates to regions.																	1541-5856					OCT	2018	16	10					680	695		10.1002/lom3.10275							WOS:000447207700006

Substantial primary production in the land-remote region of the central and northern Scotia Sea	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY												The Scotia Sea area has high productivity relative to the Southern Ocean as a whole, but this displays strong latitudinal and longitudinal gradients. Elucidating the extent of these from a single cruise is problematic, given the high variability of bloom timing and location in this region. Therefore, this study used data from transects across the central Scotia Sea in spring, summer and autumn of 2006, 2008 and 2009, combined with satellite data, to obtain a larger-scale appreciation of the latitudinal contrasts in phytoplankton standing stock and primary production across the region. Concentrations of nitrate, phosphate and particularly silicic acid increased towards the south of the transect with the latter showing a step change at the Southern Antarctic Circumpolar Current Front (SACCF). Changes in seasonal nutrient concentrations indicated increasing phytoplankton uptake north of similar to 57 degrees S that peaked at similar to 53 degrees S in the Georgia Basin. Based on seasonal depletions of nitrate relative to phosphate, the highest relative nitrate uptake occurred northwest of South Georgia on the periphery of the Georgia Basin, indicating efficient nitrate use here due to iron-replete conditions. An integrative approach to examine these gradients was with the use of 10-year satellite climatology data. These showed that the lowest mean chlorophyll a (chl-a) values were in the central/northern Scotia Sea, but these were still substantial values, 67% of values within the Georgia Basin bloom. Cruise data on chl-a and on microplankton biomass from cell counts support this finding of substantial biomass in the central Scotia Sea; since these averaged half of values in the iron-fertilised bloom of the Georgia Basin downstream of South Georgia. Given that our transect was nearly 1000 km long and in parts was land remote with low iron concentrations, the relatively high production in the central and northern Scotia Sea is surprising. Iron levels may be maintained here by efficient recycling and irregular injections, possibly for example from dust deposition or shelf-derived inputs from the south. The moderate chl-a concentration across the mid-Scotia Sea and southwest of South Georgia reflect periodic, non-ice-associated blooms that occur in some years and not others. These may provide a connection between the large populations of krill inhabiting the northern and southern fringes of the Scotia Sea. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Divergent responses of Pygoscelis penguins reveal a common environmental driver	OECOLOGIA												The responses of predators to environmental variability in the Antarctic Peninsula region have exhibited divergent patterns owing to variation in the geographic settings of colonies and predator life-history strategies. Five breeding colonies of Pygoscelis penguins from King George Island and Livingston Island, South Shetland Islands, Antarctica, were examined to (1) compare the responses of sympatric congeners to recent changes in their Antarctic ecosystem and (2) assess underlying causes for such responses. We used linear regression and correlation analyses to compare indices of abundance, recruitment, and summer breeding performance of the Adelie (P. adeliae), gentoo (P. papua), and chinstrap penguins (P. antarctica). Breeding colonies of Adelie and chinstrap penguins have declined by roughly 50% since the mid-1970s, and recruitment indices of Adelie penguins have declined by roughly 80%, but no such patterns are evident for gentoo penguins. Fledging success, however, has remained stable at all breeding colonies. The different trends in abundance and recruitment indices for each species, despite generally similar indices of summer performance, suggest that winter conditions contribute to the divergent responses among the penguins. In particular, strong correlations between indices of penguin and krill recruitment suggest that penguins in the South Shetland Islands may live under an increasingly krill-limited system that has disproportionate effects on the survival of juvenile birds.				, Jefferson/AAG-1702-2021	, Jefferson/0000-0002-3600-1414												0029-8549					OCT	2007	153	4					845	855		10.1007/s00442-007-0781-4							WOS:000249407000006	17566778

In contrast to the more southern regions, the PFr was characterised by the occurrence of relatively dense phytoplankton blooms and high copepod concentrations. Faecal pellets were relatively abundant in the MIZ reaching up to 106 mug faccal pellet carbon (FPC) m(-3), whereas the concentrations in the more northern regions were about one to two orders of magnitude lower: ca. 6 mug FPC m(-3) in the southern ACC and less than 1 mug FPC m(-3) in the PFr. Thus, the region with the highest phyto- and zooplankton concentrations showed by far the lowest faecal pellet standing stock concentrations. These results and their potential ecological significance are discussed in relation to other regions of the world oceans. We conclude, that not only the biomass of phytoplankton and zooplankton, but also the structure of the plankton communities are decisive for sedimentation potentials of carbon and silica via faecal pellets in the different regions of the ocean.

Although sea Ice microalgal production is exceeded by phytoplankton production on an annual basis in most offshore regions of the Southern Ocean, blooms of sea ice algae differ considerably from the phytoplankton in terms of timing and distribution. Thus sea ice algae provide food resources for higher trophic level organisms in seasons and regions where water column biological production Is low or negligible. A flux of biogenic material from sea ice to the water column and benthos follows ice melt, and some of the algal species are known to occur in ensuing phytoplankton blooms. A review of algal species In pack ice and offshore plankton showed that dominance is common for three species: Phaeocystis antarctica, Fragilariopsis cylindrus and Fragilariopsis curta. The degree to which dominance by these species is a product of successional processes In sea Ice communities could be an important in determining their biogeochemical contribution to the Southern Ocean and their ability to seed blooms in marginal ice zones.																	0003-1569					FEB	2001	41	1					57	73		10.1668/0003-1569(2001)041[0057:TCOSIA]2.0.CO;2							WOS:000172505600006

COMPARATIVE BIOCHEMISTRY AND PHYSIOLOGY B-BIOCHEMISTRY & MOLECULAR BIOLOGY												Activities of the antioxidative enzymes superoxide dismutase (SOD). catalase, glutathione peroxidase (GPX) and glutathione reductase (GR) were measured in the cephalopods Sepia officinalis and Lolliguncula brevis,is. Maximal enzyme activities were higher in gill tissue than in the mantle musculature of both species. Activities were generally lower in tissues of L. brevis than in S. officinalis. Comparison with other ectothermic animals showed both cephalopod species to have a low enzymatic antioxidative status despite their high metabolic rate. Furthermore, changes in antioxidative enzyme activities were measured in the cuttlefish S. officinalis with increasing age. The concentrations of malondialdehyde (MDA) and lipofuscin were determined as indicators of lipid peroxidation. Investigated animals were between 1.5 months and over 12 months old. Changes of antioxidative enzyme activities with age were not uniform. SOD and GPX activities increased with age, while catalase activity declined. In contrast, GR activity remained almost unchanged in all age groups. The low level of antioxidative defense might allow for the significant age-induced rise in MDA levels in gills and mantle musculature and for the increase in lipofuscin levels in mantle and brain tissue. It might thereby contribute to increased oxidative damage and a short life span in these cephalopods. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

Predictive systems ecology	PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES												Human societies, and their well-being, depend to a significant extent on the state of the ecosystems that surround them. These ecosystems are changing rapidly usually in response to anthropogenic changes in the environment. To determine the likely impact of environmental change on ecosystems and the best ways to manage them, it would be desirable to be able to predict their future states. We present a proposal to develop the paradigm of predictive systems ecology, explicitly to understand and predict the properties and behaviour of ecological systems. We discuss the necessary and desirable features of predictive systems ecology models. There are places where predictive systems ecology is already being practised and we summarize a range of terrestrial and marine examples. Significant challenges remain but we suggest that ecology would benefit both as a scientific discipline and increase its impact in society if it were to embrace the need to become more predictive.

Among these changes are the development of cryptophytes under warmer conditions in detriment of diatoms, and the reduced krill availability in the environment. An isotopic approach was used to investigate whether the temporal and spatial patterns of energy transfer from phytoplankton (using particulate organic matter - POM - as a proxy of primary producers) to baleen whales (humpback Megaptera novaeanglieae, fin - Balaenoptera physalus, Antarctic minke - Balaenoptera bonaerensis), and killer whales - Orcinus orca - is similar in areas under different effects of warming around the northern Antarctic Peninsula (NAP). Samples of POM (n = 65), krill (n = 29) and skin of baleen (n = 106) and, opportunistically, killer whales (n = 5) were collected in Gerlache and Bransfield Straits (western AP) and the Powell Basin (northeastern AP) during the austral summers of 2013-2016. Mean isotope values for delta C-13 and delta N-15 values were, respectively, -26.3 parts per thousand (+/- 2.9) and 0.9 parts per thousand (+/- 1.7) for POM, -25.6 parts per thousand (0.9) and 5.3 parts per thousand (+/- 1.1) for krill, -24.1 parts per thousand (+/- 2) and 8.9 parts per thousand (+/- 1.5) for humpback, -24.6 parts per thousand (+/- 1.2) and 8.2 parts per thousand (+/- 0.7) for fin, -24.4 parts per thousand (+/- 1.6) and 8.7 parts per thousand (+/- 1) for Antarctic minke whales, and 23.6 parts per thousand (+/- 1.2) and 8.9%0 (+/- 1.7) for killer whales. Interannual significant differences were found for delta C-13 values of POM and fin whales' samples, while spatial differences were found for delta C-13 values of POM samples and humpback whales and for delta N-15 values of POM, humpback and Antarctic minke whales. Lower delta C-13 and delta N-15 values for the base of the food web tended to be observed towards open sea regions (Powell Basin and an area under the influence of the Bellingshausen Sea waters). The isoscapes generated for the baseline of the NAP ecosystem provided unprecedented information, to the best of our knowledge, of how the delta C-13 and delta N-15 values of POM varied spatially and temporally in the region. HPLC-CHEMTAX pigment analysis indicated that two of the main phytoplankton groups in the study region were diatoms and cryptophytes. The contribution of these groups to the total phytoplankton biomass was positively and negatively correlated with the POM delta C-13 values, respectively. Despite the spatial and temporal limited interpretation of our results due to our reduced sampling effort to the east of the AP and to the relatively short temporal range investigated, the differences observed in the isotopic composition are considered representative of contrasting environmental conditions. The present study provides new insights on stable isotope values in the Antarctic ecosystem and may help to foresee the consequences of physico-chemical changes in water properties to the biota due to global warming.

J	Bird, DF; Karl, DM				Bird, DF; Karl, DM			Uncoupling of bacteria and phytoplankton during the austral spring bloom in Gerlache Strait, Antarctic Peninsula	AQUATIC MICROBIAL ECOLOGY												The response of the bacterial (Bacteria and Archaea) community to vernal phytoplankton blooms was examined over a grid of stations in Gerlache Strait, Antarctic Peninsula, during the RACER II program (29 October to 26 November 1989). Total bacterial production (0.13 to 10.6 mg C m(-3) d(-1)). based on the incorporation of H-3-leucine into protein, increased with increasing chlorophyll a (chl a) concentration. Bacterial cell-specific growth rate also increased with increasing primary production among stations. Nevertheless, bacterial cell abundance was greatest at the sites that had the lowest chi a concentrations, and declined wherever phytoplankton bloomed. Early bloom communities had few nanoprotist grazers; grazing was undetectable by the Landry-Hassett dilution method during this period. Fully developed bloom communities (chl a > 10 mg m(-3)) had a profusion of nanoprotist grazers (median 3000 cells ml(-1)). Despite relatively low ingestion rates per individual (0.9 bacteria cell(-1) h(-1)), the abundant grazing community kept bacterial biomass very low in Gerlache Strait, to the point that the metabolism of the pelagic bacterial surface community was only a minor fraction of total ecosystem metabolism. Grazing was the apparent cause, although biomass limitation of the bacteria due to lack of resources (e.g. bioavailable dissolved organic matter) may be the ultimate cause of the uncoupling of bacterial and phytoplanktonic communities in these habitats.

ISP selectively induces water solubility of muscle proteins by changing pH. When muscle proteins are dissolved, they are separated from lipids and other insoluble fractions such as skin, bones, scales, etc. Following separation, the dissolved proteins are subjected to subsequent pH change that causes protein precipitation and yields protein isolate. ISP processing efficiently recovers protein isolates of high quality from both nutritional and technological stand point. However, attempts at commercializing food products developed from the ISP-recovered protein isolates have been very limited. Results from laboratory-scale product development research demonstrate the potential for the use of ISP-recovered protein isolates as a base and functional ingredient for prototypes of nutraceutical foods with specific health benefits. This article reviews ISP as an innovative means to recover functional protein isolates from low-value sources. It also covers recent attempts to develop prototypes of nutraceutical food products using the ISP-recovered protein isolates targeting diet-driven cardiovascular disease. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

There is an increasing interest in incorporating omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) oils in food with a simultaneous sodium reduction. FPI was recovered from whole gutted trout using ISP. FPI was used as a main ingredient in heat-set gels made with omega-3 PUFAs oils (flaxseed, algae, fish, krill, and blend) and KCI-based salt substitute. The objectives were to determine (1) protein gelation, (2) color and texture, and (3) sodium and potassium content of the developed functional food (i.e., heat-set gels). Color properties were improved except when krill or algae oil was added. Texture profile analysis showed that omega-3 PUFAs generally did not affect texture of trout protein gels. The addition of omega-3 PUFAs oil improved heat-induced protein gelation as demonstrated by dynamic rheology. Elastic modulus increased when omega-3 PUFAs oil was added except krill oil. Salt substitute resulted in reduced sodium and increased potassium content in the heat-set gels. The functional food products developed from FRI were nutritionally enhanced with omega-3 PUFAs, had reduced sodium and increased potassium; while the color and texture properties were good and gelation properties were improved.

Marine microbes are an essential part of the marine food web and are a critical link in biogeochemical processes in the ocean, such as the cycling of nutrients and carbon. Despite this, the response of Antarctic marine microbial communities to ocean acidification is poorly understood. We investigated the effect of increasing fCO(2) on the growth of heterotrophic nanoflagellates (HNFs), nano- and picophytoplankton, and prokaryotes (heterotrophic Bacteria and Archaea) in a natural coastal Antarctic marine microbial community from Prydz Bay, East Antarctica. At CO2 levels >= 634 mu atm, HNF abundance was reduced, coinciding with increased abundance of picophytoplankton and prokaryotes. This increase in picophytoplankton and prokaryote abundance was likely due to a reduction in top-down control of grazing HNFs. Nanophytoplankton abundance was elevated in the 634 mu atm treatment, suggesting that moderate increases in CO2 may stimulate growth. The taxonomic and morphological differences in CO2 tolerance we observed are likely to favour dominance of microbial communities by prokaryotes, nanophytoplankton, and picophytoplankton. Such changes in predator-prey interactions with ocean acidification could have a significant effect on the food web and biogeochemistry in the Southern Ocean, intensifying organic-matter recycling in surface waters; reducing vertical carbon flux; and reducing the quality, quantity, and availability of food for higher trophic levels.

J	Santora, JA; Veit, RR				Santora, Jarrod A.; Veit, Richard R.			Spatio-temporal persistence of top predator hotspots near the Antarctic Peninsula	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												We quantified species richness and abundance of seabirds and marine mammals in order to identify marine areas that are persistently attractive to top predators. Shipboard surveys across a 150 000 km(2) grid off the Antarctic Peninsula were conducted once or twice each year from 2003 to 2011 during which the distribution and abundance of top predators were mapped. We hypothesized that spatial organization of species richness and abundance hotspots reflect persistent habitat use and are regionalized according to distance from land and oceanographic boundaries. To test this, we used a new hotspot variance metric based on the percentage of time that the species richness or abundance estimate at any one location is greater than 1 standard deviation above the long term means for the entire survey grid. Species richness hotspots were based on all species sighted, while abundance hotspots were based on concentrations of 16 species: 13 seabirds (penguins, petrels and albatrosses), 1 pinniped and 2 baleen whales. Species abundance hotspots reflected 2 major groupings-those with oceanic and coastal origins. We identified 15 richness hotspots, 9 of which were in proximity to the southern Antarctic Circumpolar Current front; the 6 others were associated with major breeding colonies and the location of 2 submarine canyon systems. Our approach integrates temporal and spatial variances over 14 individual surveys and provides useful reference points for identifying ecologically important areas, refining food web models and developing spatial management of and conservation strategies for marine ecosystems.																	0171-8630	1616-1599					2013	487						287	304		10.3354/meps10350							WOS:000322577400023						
J	Lynnes, AS; Reid, K; Croxall, JP				Lynnes, AS; Reid, K; Croxall, JP			Diet and reproductive success of Adelie and chinstrap penguins: linking response of predators to prey population dynamics	POLAR BIOLOGY												The diet and reproductive performance of two sympatric penguin species were studied at Signy Island, South Orkney Islands between 1997 and 2001. Each year, Adelie (Pygoscelis adeliae) and chinstrap (P. antarctica) penguins fed almost exclusively (>99% by mass) on Antarctic krill; however, there was considerable inter-annual variation in reproductive output. In 1998, chinstrap penguins were adversely affected by extensive sea-ice in the vicinity of the colony, whereas Adelie penguins were unaffected by this. However, in 2000, both species suffered reduced reproductive output. Detailed analysis of the population-size structure of krill in the diet indicated a lack of recruitment of small krill into the population since 1996. A simple model of krill growth and mortality indicated that the biomass represented by the last recruiting cohort would decline dramatically between 1999 and 2000. Thus, despite the lack of a change in the proportion of krill in the diet, the population demographics of the krill population suggested that the abundance of krill may have fallen below the level required to support normal breeding success of penguins sometime before or during the 2000 breeding season. The role of marine predators as indicator species is greatly enhanced when studies provide data reflecting not only the consequences of changes in the ecosystem but also those data that elucidate the causes of such changes.																	0722-4060	1432-2056				AUG	2004	27	9					544	554		10.1007/s00300-004-0617-1							WOS:000223264400004

Predation rates on Acartia 10.004 to 0.144 Acartia (mg acetone-extracted dry weight, E(dw))-1 h-1] were comparable to those of more carnivorous krill and were up to 32 times higher than grazing rates on C. gracilis. Ingestion rates on C gracilis were very low (0.45 to 3.45 ng pigment mg-1 E(dw) h-1), but because of their small size, algae like C gracilis may be suboptimal food for N. australis. We used a Holling type III model to describe the predation functional response. A Michaelis-Menten model best described the grazing functional response. N. australis ingested Acartia at significantly lower rates when algae were present. This effect was independent of algal concentration: ingestion rates of Acartia at 3.1, 7.5 and 17.0 mug chl a l-1 were not significantly different. Parameter estimates showed that the presence of C gracilis reduced the attack rate on, and increased the handling time of, Acartia. Presumably the increased time spent processing (capturing, handling, ingesting) C. gracilis reduced the time available to search for Acartia. Krill ingested pigment faster at high copepod concentrations. Analysis of gut pigment in N. australis feeding on Acartia alone showed that significant quantities of pigment can be derived from either the stomachs of ingested prey or copepod faeces. The implications of this finding are that herbivorous feeding rates measured in situ by the gut fluorescence technique may be biased for omnivorous zooplankton.																	0171-8630	1616-1599				APR	1994	107	1-2					41	53		10.3354/meps107041							WOS:A1994NH21600004

Local environment shapes adaptation of Phaeocystis antarctica to salinity perturbations: Evidence for physiological resilience	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY												The Southern Ocean (SO) is a fragile ecosystem as judged by changes in the timing of the advance and retreat of its ice cover. In the SO, the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) and the near shore gyres (Weddell Sea and Ross Sea) provide local environments with distinct temperature and salinity attributes associated with varying sea ice history. Phaeocystis antarctica is a prymnesiophyte often dominating polar phytoplankton blooms in the (SO) and is a keystone species there because its abundance can have negative effects on higher trophic levels and it can influence air/sea gas exchange involved in DMSP production, Thus, its ability to survive in response to perturbations in the environments may be linked to its genetic diversity within its populations as they move around the SO. Here we apply increased (70 PSU) and decreased (18 PSU) salinity treatments to five genetically different P. antarctica strains isolated from three different water masses to test whether genetic similarity or water mass physical features were more important in determining responses to salinity changes, such as those encountered by inclusion into sea ice brine channels and/or its subsequent melt water in those water masses that have annual ice cover. Strains that were geographically close (isolated from the same water mass), but genetically distinct (ca. 30% similar and from different gene pools as judged by microsatellite (MS) and amplified fragment linked polymorphisms (AFLP) analyses responded similarly to higher and lower salinity regimes, whereas genetically close strains (ca. 95% identical or from the same gene pool) that originated from different water masses and hence different environmental conditions responded differently. Dimethylsulphoniopropionate (DMSP) production in response to these salinity changes were not significantly different between any of the strains/treatments. Considering the presence of highly similar genotypes in ice-free as well as seasonally ice covered sampling sites, the observed phenotypic differences most likely result from rapid local adaptation between both habitat types or a hybridization of isolates from the two gene pools with the resultant genotype for salinity tolerance being that from which the isolate originated, suggesting that the selective effect of seasonal presence or year-round absence of sea ice overrides gene flow between these habitats to adapt the physiology of cells to the environment in a relatively short period of time.																	0022-0981	1879-1697				MAY	2021	538								151527	10.1016/j.jembe.2021.151527							WOS:000641001600003

This unsustainable exploitation desperately calls for other suitable resources that can relieve the pressure on the fisheries. The utilization of Calanus finmarchicus has been proposed as a suitable alternative. There is, however, still a question of both ecological and economical sustainability of such exploitation. Scope and approach: This review describes currently utilized marine resources, and compares the suitability of C. finmarchicus as a useful alternative for those resources. Additionally, the review describes the life history and chemical composition of C. finmarchicus. Current utilization of C. finmarchicus is also described, along with industrial methods used to derive various products from Calanus, as well as a discussion of other potential products from the resource. Key findings and conclusions: C. finmarchicus can potentially be considered an alternative marine resource as it has a unique lipid composition, is rich in antioxidants, and contains diverse enzymes. However, the question of sustainable catching remains unanswered and must be addressed before C. finmarchicus can be considered for utilization.

The present study examine the functional biology and evaluate the trophic role of krill in the GodthAyenbsfjord (64 degrees N, 51 degrees W) SW Greenland, through a combination of fieldwork and laboratory experiments. Krill biomass was highest in the middle fjord and inner fjord, whereas no krill was found offshore. The dominating species Thysanoessa raschii revealed a type III functional response when fed with the diatom Thalassiosira weissflogii. At food saturation, T. raschii exhibited a daily ration of 1% body C d(-1). Furthermore, T. raschii was capable of exploiting plankton cells from 5 to 400 mu m, covering several trophic levels of the pelagic food web. The calculated grazing impact by T. raschii on the fjord plankton community was negligible. However, the schooling and migratory behaviour of krill will concentrate and elevate the grazing in specific areas of the euphotic zone.

J	Hofmann, EE; Murphy, EJ				Hofmann, EE; Murphy, EJ			Advection, krill, and Antarctic marine ecosystems	ANTARCTIC SCIENCE												Advective processes are recognized as being important in structuring and maintaining marine ecosystems. In the Southern Ocean advective effects are perhaps most clearly observed because the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) provides a connection between most parts of the system, including open ocean and continental shelf regions. The ACC also provides a mechanism for large-scale transport of plankton, such as Antarctic krill (Euphousia superba Dana), which is an important component of the Southern Ocean food web. This overview provides a summary of recent observational and modelling results that consider the importance of advection to the Southern Ocean ecosystem and, in particular, the role of advection in structuring the large-scale distribution of Antarctic krill. The results of these studies show that advection is a dominant process controlling Antarctic krill distribution and by inference an important process affecting overall structure and production of the Southern Ocean food web. The overview shows that quantifying the roles of advective and retentive physical processes, and population dynamic and behavioural biological processes in determining the regional and local distribution of krill and abundance will be an important research focus. Strategies for future Antarctic multidisciplinary research programmes that are focused on understanding advective processes at a circumpolar scale are Suggested.																	0954-1020	1365-2079				DEC	2004	16	4					487	499		10.1017/S0954102004002275							WOS:000226060800010

In both years Calanus finmarchicus and Calanus glacialis dominated, although the boreal C. finmarchicus was more abundant than the Arctic C. glacialis in 1997. This coincided with a 2degreesC higher water temperature at 50 m in 1997, indicating stronger influence of Atlantic origin water that year. Advected Calanus finmarchicus occurred in deep and subsurface layers of the outer fjord in 1996 (200 ind. m(-3), mainly CIII). A less abundant local population aggregated in surface layers of the inner fjord (100 ind. m(-3)). Similarly, advected C. finmarchicus occurred in subsurface layers in 1997 (446 ind. m(-3), mainly CIII and CIV) and a local population in surface layers (183 ind. m(-3), mainly CI). Calanus glacialis in 1996 aggregated as CII and CIII in the deep layers of the outer fjord (272 ind. m(-3)), whereas CIII-CV were abundant (216 ind. m(-3)) in cold surface waters of the inner fjord. In 1997 C. glacialis (mostly CIII-CV) was more abundant in the outer than in the inner part of the fjord (40 and 192 ind. m(-3), respectively). Within Kongsfjorden, Calanus finmarchicus needs one year to complete its life cycle, whereas Calanus glacialis needs two. Calanus hyperboreus seems to be an expatriate in the fjord system.

Penguin responses to climate change in the Southern Ocean	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY												Penguins are adapted to live in extreme environments, but they can be highly sensitive to climate change, which disrupts penguin life history strategies when it alters the weather, oceanography and critical habitats. For example, in the southwest Atlantic, the distributional range of the ice-obligate emperor and AdElie penguins has shifted poleward and contracted, while the ice-intolerant gentoo and chinstrap penguins have expanded their range southward. In the Southern Ocean, the El Nino-Southern Oscillation and the Southern Annular Mode are the main modes of climate variability that drive changes in the marine ecosystem, ultimately affecting penguins. The interaction between these modes is complex and changes over time, so that penguin responses to climate change are expected to vary accordingly, complicating our understanding of their future population processes. Penguins have long life spans, which slow microevolution, and which is unlikely to increase their tolerance to rapid warming. Therefore, in order that penguins may continue to exploit their transformed ecological niche and maintain their current distributional ranges, they must possess adequate phenotypic plasticity. However, past species-specific adaptations also constrain potential changes in phenology, and are unlikely to be adaptive for altered climatic conditions. Thus, the paleoecological record suggests that penguins are more likely to respond by dispersal rather than adaptation. Ecosystem changes are potentially most important at the borders of current geographic distributions, where penguins operate at the limits of their tolerance; species with low adaptability, particularly the ice-obligates, may therefore be more affected by their need to disperse in response to climate and may struggle to colonize new habitats. While future sea-ice contraction around Antarctica is likely to continue affecting the ice-obligate penguins, understanding the responses of the ice-intolerant penguins also depends on changes in climate mode periodicities and interactions, which to date remain difficult to reproduce in general circulation models.																	1354-1013	1365-2486				JUL	2009	15	7					1618	1630		10.1111/j.1365-2486.2009.01909.x							WOS:000266700000002

Modeling the nitrogen and carbon cycling in Marguerite Bay, Antarctica: Annual variations in ammonium and net community production	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY												A quasi-two-dimensional biogeochemical model was applied to Marguerite Bay to investigate differences in the seasonal cycles of nitrogen and carbon of the plankton communities between 2000-2001 and 2001-2002. The impetus for the modeling effort came from observations made during the US SO Southern Ocean Global Ocean Ecosystem dynamics (SO GLOBEC) program field surveys in 2001 and 2002 that showed a two-fold decrease in net community production (NCP) and ammonium stocks. Simulated nutrient fields matched these observations, indicating that NCP was mainly controlled by the availability of light to phytoplankton. Greater sea-ice cover led to a shorter phytoplankton bloom in 2001-2002 than in 2000-2001. Furthermore, the simulated lower primary production led to smaller bacterial ammonification during the second year. Additionally, smaller zooplankton stocks were observed that led to less simulated excretion of ammonium during 2002. The results of the numerical simulations showed that remineralization of organic matter to ammonium by bacteria accounted for up to 45% of the ammonium production during each year.

This oil is characterized by its high concentration of long-chain omega-3 fatty acids, especially eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). The contents of EPA and DHA were similar to those in fish oils, but with the difference that almost the half are located in phospholipids (mainly phosphatidylcholine). This might explain its higher absorption and bioavailability. This highly unsaturated oil maintains stable due to the presence of astaxanthin, a potent antioxidant, which assures the stability of the omega-3 fatty acids. However, there is lack of investigations reporting a deep comprehensive description of the krill oil (KO) lipid composition. The characterization includes new data of its neutral and polar components and the identification of triacylglycerols, diacylglycerols, and molecular species that has been done by different chromatographic techniques as gas chromatography-mass spectrometry/flame ionization detector (GC-MS/FID), flash chromatography-evaporative light scattering detector (FC-ELSD), and HPLC-ELSD. Also phospholipid molecular species by using ultraperformance liquid chromatography/quadruple-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC/QToF-MS) have been determined.

J	SCHNEIDER, DC				SCHNEIDER, DC			THE ROLE OF FLUID-DYNAMICS IN THE ECOLOGY OF MARINE BIRDS	OCEANOGRAPHY AND MARINE BIOLOGY												Marine birds inhabit the boundary between two fluids-the ocean and the air. Hypotheses relating avian movements and dispersion to the dynamics of these fluids fall into three categories: effects on primary production, effects on prey dispersion, and effects on avian movements. Evidence for these effects comes for a substantial body of descriptive studies; these have established that marine birds are associated with large scale circulatory structures that affect primary production, that marine birds are episodically associated with smaller scale fluid motions that affect prey dispersion, and that marine birds in motion interact with the circulation of both the ocean and the atmosphere over a wide range of spatial scales. Simple scaling arguments can be used to identify, in a given situation, the contribution of fluid dynamics to the spatial dynamics of marine birds. Individual movements (Lagrangian measurements) can be related to patterns of dispersion (Eulerian measurements) in theory, although this has yet to be accomplished in practice.																	0078-3218						1991	29						487	521									WOS:A1991MG66700008

Antarctic Futures: An Assessment of Climate-Driven Changes in Ecosystem Structure, Function, and Service Provisioning in the Southern Ocean	ANNUAL REVIEW OF MARINE SCIENCE, VOL 12	Annual Review of Marine Science											In this article, we analyze the impacts of climate change on Antarctic marine ecosystems. Observations demonstrate large-scale changes in the physical variables and circulation of the Southern Ocean driven by warming, stratospheric ozone depletion, and a positive Southern Annular Mode. Alterations in the physical environment are driving change through all levels of Antarctic marine food webs, which differ regionally. The distributions of key species, such as Antarctic krill, are also changing. Differential responses among predators reflect differences in species ecology. The impacts of climate change on Antarctic biodiversity will likely vary for different communities and depend on species range. Coastal communities and those of sub-Antarctic islands, especially range-restricted endemic communities, will likely suffer the greatest negative consequences of climate change. Simultaneously, ecosystem services in the Southern Ocean will likely increase. Such decoupling of ecosystem services and endemic species will require consideration in the management of human activities such as fishing in Antarctic marine ecosystems.

Results of the study indicate that during the experiment, primary production, although variable, increased from similar to300 to similar to800 mg C m(-2) d(-1). This increase could likely be related to development of a shallow pycnocline. Analysis of sediment trap data showed that the vertical carbon flux resulting from sedimentation and grazing activity was greatest in the upper water column (<80 m), The importance of grazers to total POC flux was highest at the beginning and the end of the investigation and accounted for up to 15% of total carbon flux. The contribution of grazers to vertical flux was negligible (< 2%) during the intermediate part of the Southern Ocean Drogue study, Lower contribution of grazers to sedimentation of POC at depth can likely be related to community composition of zooplankton. Sedimentation of phytoplankton cells from the upper water column increased during the study. Here, downward POC flux resulting from sedimentation of microphytoplankton was equivalent to 15-75% of the total. Increase in sedimentation of phytoplankton during the study can be related to an increase in the average size of phytoplankton cells. Transport of POC from surface waters to deeper depths resulting from sedimentation or grazing activity was equivalent to <48% of total daily primary production, measured at 50 m, while the same value for phytoplankton flux did not exceed 27% of the total. Zooplankton density was insufficient to exert either a positive (via faecal pellets) or negative (via reducing suspended phytoplankton concentration) effect on particulate carbon sedimentation. This resulted in algal sink being the most important mechanism in downward POC flux during the onset of the phytoplankton bloom period in the Marginal Ice Zone, even in the presence of pelagic tunicates.

J	Prezelin, BB; Hofmann, EE; Mengelt, C; Klinck, JM				Prezelin, BB; Hofmann, EE; Mengelt, C; Klinck, JM			The linkage between Upper Circumpolar Deep Water (UCDW) and phytoplankton assemblages on the west Antarctic Peninsula continental shelf	JOURNAL OF MARINE RESEARCH												Intrusion of Upper Circumpolar Deep Water (UCDW), which was derived from the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC), onto the western Antarctic Peninsula (WAP) shelf region in January 1993 provided a reservoir of nutrient-rich, warmer water below 150 m that subsequently upwelled into the upper water column. Four sites, at which topographically-induced upwelling of UCDW occurred, were identified in a 50 km by 400 km band along the outer WAP continental shelf. One additional site at which wind-driven upwelling occurred was also identified. Diatom-dominated phytoplankton assemblages were always associated with a topographically-induced upwelling site. Such phytoplankton communities were not detected at any other shelf location, although diatoms were present everywhere in the 80,000 km(2) study area and UCDW covered about one-third the area below 150 m. Phytoplankton communities dominated by taxa other than diatoms were restricted to transition waters between the UCDW and shelf waters, the southerly flowing waters out of the Gerlache Strait, and/or the summertime glacial ice melt surface waters very near shore. We suggest that in the absence of episodic intrusion and upwelling of UCDW, the growth requirements for elevated silicate/nitrate ratios and/or other upwelled constituents (e.g. trace metals) are not sufficiently met for diatoms to achieve high abundance or community dominance. One consequence of this is that the ice-free regions of the outer WAP continental shelf will not experience predictable spring diatom blooms. Rather, this region will experience episodic diatom blooms that occur at variable intervals and during different seasonal conditions, if the physical structuring events are occurring. Preferential drawdown of silicate relative to nitrate was observed at each of the offshore upwelling sites and resulted in a reduction in the ambient silicate:nitrate ratio relative to the corresponding value for unmodified UCDW (1.5 versus 3.0 for UCDW). The magnitude of the nutrient drawdown in areas of topographically-induced upwelling suggested that diatom growth had been elevated in response to recent upwelling but that the resulting increased algal biomass was either dispersed by advective processes and/or consumed by the larger krill that were observed to be associated with each offshore upwelling site. Thus, diatom bloom conditions on the outer WAP shelf may not be recognized based on elevated biomass and/or rates of carbon fixation. It was likely that similar physical forcing of significant phytoplankton growth, especially diatoms, may occur but be undetected in regions where the southern boundary of the ACC nears the Antarctic continental shelf edge. Our analyses from the west Antarctic Peninsula demonstrate coupling of the structure of the physical environment with nutrient distributions and phytoplankton assemblages and through to the higher trophic levels, such as Antarctic krill. This environment-trophic coupling may also occur in other regions of the Antarctic, as suggested by correspondences between the distribution of Southern ACC boundary and regions of high concentrations of Antarctic krill. The many mechanisms underlying this coupling remain to be determined, but it was clear that the ecology and biology of the components of the marine food web of the Antarctic continental shelf cannot be studied in isolation from one another or in isolation from the physical environment.

Instantaneous movement of krill swarms in the Antarctic Circumpolar Current	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Antarctic krill are known to have strong swimming capabilities, but direct observations of the speed and direction of krill-swarm movement within their natural environment are rare. We identified and examined 4060 swarms within the main flow of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (Scotia Sea) using a combination of an EK60 echosounder, a 153.6 kHz acoustic Doppler current profiler, and ground-truthing nets. Net displacement magnitude (m) and net angle of deviation (d) were determined by vector subtraction from the background flow immediately below them. Values were compared against control data sets in which swarms were absent. With greater background flow, m became increasingly lower than predicted, which suggests that drag influences swarm movement. The characteristics of the flow regime influenced swarm behavior, given that both m and d varied according to the direction of background flow. Furthermore, multiple-regression analysis indicated that swarm area, the vicinity of the sea-ice edge, and salinity had a significant influence on m, with levels of displacement being greatest in larger swarms and in low-salinity regions close to the ice edge. The ice edge is a key environment for Antarctic krill and swarm behavior may assist in retaining this location. Only fluorescence was found to have a significant influence on d, with deviations being greatest in regions of highest fluorescence. This agrees with laboratory observations of krill turning more frequently within food patches. We demonstrate that it is possible to measure instantaneous movement patterns in Antarctic krill swarms and, at large scales, these movements are consistent with current understanding of responses of krill to local stimuli such as sea-ice and patches of food.

Analysing the diets of invertebrate predators using terminal restriction fragments	JOURNAL OF PEST SCIENCE												Analysing food webs in agricultural habitats is essential for the development of natural control strategies. Several molecular tools to investigate trophic interactions on a species-specific level have been developed in recent years and their advantages and limitations have been discussed. With this study we introduce another tool, terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (tRFLP). Generalist predators found in Australian brassica crops, their prey and abundant parasitoids were chosen as a model system to adapt and evaluate the tRFLP approach. Using general primers and selecting six restriction enzymes, we obtained species-specific tRF patterns for 21 of the most abundant arthropods in brassica crops. We detected up to three prey species in the gut contents of laboratory-fed predators. Detection rates differed among predators, ranging between 28 and 100%. The identification of a species-specific tRF pattern was strongly affected by the presence and concentrations of DNA from other species. In a preliminary field study, prey could be identified from 20% of the collected brown lacewings. The advantage of the tRFLP method is the possibility of identifying multiple species at once. This advantage is counterbalanced by methodological limitations, among which the most critical one is the fact that it will be difficult to maintain specificity in highly diverse ecosystems. However, if species diversity is limited and the target sequence and the primers are chosen to increase detection success, the tRFLP method can be used to study trophic interactions in the field.

Here, we investigated the inter- and intra-specific differences using stable isotope analyses in the black-bellied storm-petrel (Fregetta tropica) and the Wilson's storm-petrel (Oceanites oceanicus), breeding sympatrically in maritime Antarctica. We analysed stable carbon, nitrogen and oxygen isotopes in samples representing different life stages; chick down (pre-laying females), chick feather (chick), and adult blood (chick-rearing adults). Pre-laying females had wider stable isotope niches than chicks or chick-rearing adults, due to pre-laying females being free roaming while chick-rearing adults were central-place-foragers. Chicks were fed at a higher trophic level than the adults (higher delta N-15), likely to compensate for the high nutritional demands of the growing chicks. Wilson's storm-petrels showed substantial overlap in stable isotope niches between all life stages, while the black-bellied storm-petrel chicks showed very little overlap. Wilson's storm-petrel niches significantly overlapped with those of pre-laying and chick-rearing black-bellied storm-petrels, suggesting negligible niche partitioning. Chick growth rate was negatively correlated with chick delta N-15 values, suggesting nutritional stress resulting in the use endogenous instead of dietary amino acids in protein synthesis. The higher trophic level of the relatively larger black-bellied storm-petrel chicks may be due to their longer stay in the nest, and relatively larger body mass gain, despite chick growth rates being similar to the smaller Wilson's storm-petrel chicks. Despite breeding sympatrically, the studied storm-petrel species showed considerable overlap in isotopic niches, which may be explained by sharing the same main prey species, reducing the detectability of foraging niche partitioning through stable isotope analyses. We found dietary shifts in black-bellied storm-petrels that are absent in Wilson's, showing different chick provisioning strategies, and shows that the high productivity of the Antarctic marine ecosystem may facilitate foraging niche overlap of sympatrically living species.

However, understanding their population dynamics is limited by a paucity of data due to sampling challenges. Antarctic fur seal Arctocephalus gazella scats provide large collections of otoliths and other prey remains that can be used to form time series for important mesopelagic taxa such as Gymnoscopelus nicholsi (Gn). Examination of otoliths from scats allowed for a reconstruction of Gn age and length structure from 8 selected sample years between 2000 and 2015. While mean reconstructed length did not change significantly over the time series, mean age declined. Older age classes were scarce in scat samples, and age-6 animals were not found after 2008. During the same time period, Gn otoliths in fur seal scats declined from approximately 2000 to fewer than 200. The decline in the number of otoliths in Antarctic fur seal scat samples coupled with the negative trend in mean age suggests declines in the availability of Gn on the South Shetland Island slope region between 2000 and 2015. This study demonstrates the utility of central-place foragers in assessing populations of unfished but ecologically important mesopelagic fishes, thus allowing evaluation of hypotheses about their population structure and dispersal.

Antarctic ecosystems in transition - life between stresses and opportunities	BIOLOGICAL REVIEWS												Important findings from the second decade of the 21st century on the impact of environmental change on biological processes in the Antarctic were synthesised by 26 international experts. Ten key messages emerged that have stakeholder-relevance and/or a high impact for the scientific community. They address (i) altered biogeochemical cycles, (ii) ocean acidification, (iii) climate change hotspots, (iv) unexpected dynamism in seabed-dwelling populations, (v) spatial range shifts, (vi) adaptation and thermal resilience, (vii) sea ice related biological fluctuations, (viii) pollution, (ix) endangered terrestrial endemism and (x) the discovery of unknown habitats. Most Antarctic biotas are exposed to multiple stresses and considered vulnerable to environmental change due to narrow tolerance ranges, rapid change, projected circumpolar impacts, low potential for timely genetic adaptation, and migration barriers. Important ecosystem functions, such as primary production and energy transfer between trophic levels, have already changed, and biodiversity patterns have shifted. A confidence assessment of the degree of 'scientific understanding' revealed an intermediate level for most of the more detailed sub-messages, indicating that process-oriented research has been successful in the past decade. Additional efforts are necessary, however, to achieve the level of robustness in scientific knowledge that is required to inform protection measures of the unique Antarctic terrestrial and marine ecosystems, and their contributions to global biodiversity and ecosystem services.

Habitat preference and dive behavior of non-breeding emperor penguins in the eastern Ross Sea, Antarctica	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												Emperor penguins Aptenodytes forsteri are important predators in the Ross Sea ecosystem, yet little is known about their movement and foraging behavior outside the breeding season or within different demographic groups. In early March 2013, we instrumented 20 non-breeding emperor penguins in the eastern Ross Sea with satellite-linked recorders and analyzed their habitat preference and dive behavior. Track length ranged from 273 km to nearly 9000 km and dive data were obtained for over 96 000 dives (mean maximum depth: 90.2 +/- 77.8 (SD) m, mean dive duration: 4.6 +/- 2.3 min), 17 of which exceeded the previous duration record of 27.6 min. Overall, emperor penguins preferred areas north of Cape Colbeck that were beyond the shelf break and received more sunlight. In these areas, penguins performed dives that were deeper, longer, faster, and more pelagic than dives located near the colony. Birds exhibited various movement and foraging strategies ('shelf' and 'gyre'; benthic and pelagic). The occurrence of deeper and longer dives during the day (n = 28 318) and at twilight (n = 60 171) than at night (n = 7582), especially at high latitudes, is consistent with emperor penguins being visual predators. Observed differences in both movement and dive behavior as a function of light may indicate a change in prey preference across space and time. Our study offers novel insight into the habitat preferences and dive behavior for a previously unstudied demographic group, at a time when emperor penguins experience the most severe environmental conditions of their annual life cycle.

Investigations of intra-seasonal variation in foraging habitat will, therefore, provide clues to understand how predators respond to changes in the marine environment. As an abundant, central-place foraging mesopredator, we selected to examine this with Adelie penguins (Pygoscelis adeliae) breeding in the Prydz Bay region where the sea-ice environment is heterogeneous and the largest populations in East Antarctica occur. In the summer of 2011/12, using GPS tracks, we calculated First Passage Time to extract Area Restricted Search (ARS) zones to indicate foraging intensity, and classified the ARS zones by K-means clustering. In total, 47, 64, 23 and 10 ARS zones were detected during early and late incubation, chick-guard and creche stages (n = 4, 11, 6 and 3 birds). Higher and more stable sea-ice concentration and increased distance from the nearest major colony had positive effects on foraging intensity. The ARS zones were classified into nearshore, offshore and open water habitats. Birds used offshore areas and avoided open water during early incubation and creche, when birds returned less frequently. During late incubation and chick-guard, when birds frequently returned, they used nearshore and open water areas as expected from the proportion of available habitats. Our results suggest that the pack ice and reduced intra-specific competition for prey were the preferred foraging condition for Adelie penguins, and highlight the importance of seasonal changes in sea-ice environment to their foraging habitat selectivity.																	0025-3162	1432-1793				JUL	2021	168	7							97	10.1007/s00227-021-03899-8							WOS:000663539200016

Currently 35 colonies with approximately half a million breeding pairs are known. All but one of these known colonies are situated in East Antarctica. However, an estimate derived from at sea studies in three of four apparent centers of oceanic occurrence suggests a population as high as four to seven million breeding pairs (10 to 20 million individuals). In spite of the tentative nature of such an estimate, the difference xith the colony-derived figure strongly suggests the existence of large, currently undiscovered colonies. particularly in western Antarctica and Victoria Land, where a complete mismatch exists between bird observations at sea and known colonies. In eastern Antarctica, in addition to undiscovered colonies. some known ones could be considerably larger than currently documented.

Isotopic values in serially sampled whiskers of 34 leopard (Hydrurga leptonyx, HL), 13 crabeater (Lobodon carcinophaga, LC) and 14 Weddell (Leptonychotes weddellii, LW) seals were measured. Two clusters of leopard seals were identified based on their delta N-15 values: a high-trophic level group (HLhigh) and a low-trophic level group (HLlow). Overlap in SEAc was only seen between HL and LC, while HL and LW showed an overlap in their convex hulls, but no overlap in SEAc. Diet compositions estimated using Bayesian stable isotope mixing models revealed intra- and interspecific differences among seals. For leopard seals highest dietary contributor was krill, while for HLhigh krill and fish cephalopod were the main contributors. Mixing models run separately for each HL seal showed a large variation in the proportional contribution of krill (12-90%) compared to the other sources (cephalopods, fish, penguins and seals). The crabeater seals almost exclusively consumed krill, with a low contribution of the other prey. Weddell seals, on the other hand, showed a high proportion of fish and a lower contribution of cephalopods and penguins, while the contribution of krill seemed to be minimal. This study is the first to compare isotopic niches of three Antarctic seals from the WAP. Our results indicate that crabeater and leopard seals seem to have a strong and a considerable dependence on krill, respectively. Although the WAP is characterized by an unusually high production of Antarctic krill the large community of vertebrate predators that feed upon this resource (penguins, seals and baleen whales) should be especially vulnerable under future scenarios of reduction of krill biomass. Under the current drastic environmental changes in the WAP, continuing to monitor WAP seal diets and the relative contribution of krill to them will help understand the degree to which climate change may alter the population dynamics of these upper trophic level species.

To better understand the efficacy of krill meal, a 200-day feeding trial was conducted with Russian sturgeon (Acipenser gueldenstaedtii). Four extruded diets in which KM replaced 0%, 10%, 20%, or 30% of FM in the formulation were fed to sturgeons (weight 481 g) for 200 days. Growth of Russian sturgeon fed diets containing KM was as good, or even better, than fish fed a FM control diet. No differences were observed in terms of dorsal muscle composition between the fish fed diets which contained KM and those fed the FM control diet. Fluoride concentrations in the dorsal muscle, liver, and kidney, as well as swim bladder in all dietary groups were below a detectable limit. In the gills, skin, vertebral bone and dorsal scutes, the fluoride content from the KM groups progressively increased with dietary fluoride concentration. In conclusion, KM can be a partial substitute for FM in the diets of Russian sturgeon without affecting normal growth performance.																	0792-156X						2016	68								1319								WOS:000386305900001

CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												A multidisciplinary approach incorporating otolith chemistry, age data, and numerical Lagrangian particle simulations indicated a single, self-recruiting population of Antarctic toothfish (Dissostichus mawsoni) in the Southeast Pacific Basin (SPB) and Ross Sea, with a life history structured by the large-scale circulation. Chemistry deposited prior to capture along otolith edges demonstrated strong environmental heterogeneity, yet the chemistry in otolith nuclei, deposited during early life, showed no differences. Age data showed only adult fish in catches on the Pacific-Antarctic Ridge in the SPB and structuring of life stages consistent with transport pathways from the northern Ross Sea. Lagrangian particle simulations predicted that early life stages following the flow in the SPB would be transported to areas in the Ross Sea where juveniles are caught, whereas the circulation would facilitate adult movement along the shelf slope and back into the SPB where spawning adults are caught. These results suggest that successfully spawning fish spend only a part of their adult life history in the Ross Sea, areas in the eastern Ross Sea contribute disproportionately to the spawning population, and areas in the southwestern Ross Sea may supply fisheries in the southern Indian Ocean.

It was a major ship-based research programme in the austral summer of 2007-2008 involving scientists from 30 countries and 19 vessels. The Collaborative East Antarctic Marine Census (CEAMARC) was a multinational contribution to CAML involving scientists and students from several nations using three ships from Australia, Japan and France surveying the one area. This collaboration was a highly coordinated and comprehensive survey of the plankton, fish, benthos, oceanography and geophysical conditions of the waters north of Terre Adelie and George V Land of Eastern Antarctica.

J	Ventura, M				Ventura, Marc			Linking biochemical and elemental composition in freshwater and marine crustacean zooplankton	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												The major groups of biochemical compounds (proteins, lipids, carbohydrates, chitin, nucleic acids and nucleotides) have a distinct functional role and, therefore, incorporation of biochemical interpretations into stoichiometric analysis would improve our current understanding of species life histories and their interactions. A review of the stoichiometric composition of the main biochemical compounds of freshwater and marine zooplankton revealed high constancy. No significant differences were found between marine and freshwater species or between any of the taxonomic groups considered (copepods, cladocerans, euphausiids and mysiids) for most of the main biochemical compounds (triacylglycerol, wax esters, phospholipids and proteins). Therefore, it can be concluded that inter- and intraspecific stoichiometric variability is a result of differences in the proportions of the main biochemical compounds. Comparison of the biochemical composition of 182 freshwater and marine species revealed that freshwater species had lower ATP and free amino acid content and higher RNA content than marine species, The elemental composition of a single copepod species, Calanus finmarchicus, and the averages of each taxonomic group were estimated from the composition of major biochemical compounds and compared with the measured elemental content. Almost all of the measured carbon (C), nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) were accounted for. After proteins, nucleic acids were the second most abundant compound in the N pool of freshwater species, while free amino acids were the second most prevalent compound in marine species. Phospholipids were the most abundant compound in the P pool of marine species, while in freshwater species nucleic acids were the most abundant compound.

Why whales are big but not bigger: Physiological drivers and ecological limits in the age of ocean giants	SCIENCE												The largest animals are marine filter feeders, but the underlying mechanism of their large size remains unexplained. We measured feeding performance and prey quality to demonstrate how whale gigantism is driven by the interplay of prey abundance and harvesting mechanisms that increase prey capture rates and energy intake. The foraging efficiency of toothed whales that feed on single prey is constrained by the abundance of large prey, whereas filter-feeding baleen whales seasonally exploit vast swarms of small prey at high efficiencies. Given temporally and spatially aggregated prey, filter feeding provides an evolutionary pathway to extremes in body size that are not available to lineages that must feed on one prey at a time. Maximum size in filter feeders is likely constrained by prey availability across space and time.

J	DALY, KL; SMITH, WO				DALY, KL; SMITH, WO			PHYSICAL-BIOLOGICAL INTERACTIONS INFLUENCING MARINE PLANKTON PRODUCTION	ANNUAL REVIEW OF ECOLOGY AND SYSTEMATICS												The interaction of physical and biological processes is extremely important in structuring the biological communities in all marine environments, yet the complexity of this interaction at all scales is just beginning to be appreciated. We review the patterns of plankton biomass and the processes that influence plankton production, and in particular emphasize the importance of different processes at different time and space scales (small-scale, mesoscale, and large-scale). Examples of two different systems (the Southern Ocean and the subarctic North Pacific and North Atlantic Oceans) are given to illustrate the complexity and strength of the interactions. We conclude that biological processes may be more important at smaller scales where behavior such as vertical migration and predation may control the plankton production, whereas physical processes may be more important at larger scales in structuring biological communities. An understanding of both, however, is critical to an understanding of the distribution of plankton and the processes governing production in the ocean.																	0066-4162						1993	24						555	585		10.1146/annurev.es.24.110193.003011							WOS:A1993MJ37100020						
J	Lovvorn, JR; Baduini, CL; Hunt, GL				Lovvorn, JR; Baduini, CL; Hunt, GL			Modeling underwater visual and filter feeding by planktivorous shearwaters in unusual sea conditions	ECOLOGY												Short-tailed Shearwaters (Puffinus tenuirostris) migrate between breeding areas in Australia and wintering areas in the Bering Sea. These extreme movements allow them to feed on swarms of euphausiids (krill) that occur seasonally in different regions, but they occasionally experience die-offs when availability of euphausiids or other prey is inadequate. During a coccolithophore bloom in the Bering Sea in 1997, hundreds of thousands of Short-tailed Shearwaters starved to death. One proposed explanation was that the calcareous shells of phytoplanktonic coccolithophores reduced light transmission, thus impairing visual foraging underwater. This hypothesis assumes that shearwaters feed entirely by vision (bite-feeding), but their unique bill and tongue morphology might allow nonvisual filter-feeding within euphausiid swarms. To investigate these issues. we developed simulation models of Short-tailed Shearwaters bite-feeding and filter-feeding underwater on the euphausiid Thysanoessa raschii. The visual (bite-feeding) model considered profiles of diffuse and beam attenuation of light in the Bering Sea among seasons. sites, and years with varying influence by diatom and coccolithophore blooms. The visual model indicated that over the huge range of densities in euphausiid swarms (tens to tens of thousands per cubic meter), neither light level nor prey density had appreciable effects on intake rate; instead, intake was severely limited by capture time and capture probability after prey were detected. Thus, for shearwaters there are strong advantages of feeding on dense swarms near the surface. where dive costs are low relative to fixed intake rate, and intake might be increased by filter-feeding. With minimal effects of light conditions, starvation of shearwaters during the coccolithophore bloom probably did not result from reduced visibility underwater after prey patches were found. Alternatively, turbidity from coccolithophores might have hindered detection of euphausiid swarms from the air.

Chlorophyll a (chi a) values declined from 19 to 6 mg m(-3) during the 8 d of sampling. The bloom comprised mainly long pennate diatoms and large colonies of centric diatoms; a 200 mu m sieve retained over two-thirds of the chi a. Mesozooplankton biomass was high, 12.3 g dry mass m(-2) within the top 200 m, and comprised mainly copepods. A series of Longhurst Hardy Plankton Recorder profiles showed that the numerical dominants (Oithona similis, Drepanopus forcipatus and pteropods) resided mainly within the top 20 m, whereas the large, biomass-dominant copepods had secondary maxima rather deeper within the thermocline. Diel vertical migration was not a feature of this community, being limited to metridiid and euchaetiid copepods. Gut fluorescence measurements on 7 large copepod species showed that all fed during both day and night, although guts tended to be fullest during afternoon and night. About 20% of chi a grazed by these copepods occurred below the mixed layer, thus representing a potentially direct export of carbon from the system via sinking faecal pellets. Algal carbon rations (% body carbon ingested per day) of mixed layer copepods ranged from 3% (Rhincalanus gigas) to 20% (small copepods). With the exception of R. gigas, these values from gut fluorescence agreed with independent estimates from the site following the decline of chi a during incubations in ambient seawater. Despite low clearance sates, ingestion rates (per copepodid) were at the upper end of recorded Antarctic values, suggesting food saturation. Calanoides acutus and R. gigas cleared diatoms (including the highly elongated 0.5 to 1 mm forms) at maximal rates, Metridia spp., Calanus propinquus and small copepods, by contrast, cleared dinoflagellates and ciliates faster than diatoms of similar size. The total mixed layer zooplankton probably removed < 5% of daily primary production and < 5% of protozoan standing stocks per day.																	0171-8630	1616-1599				DEC	1996	144	1-3					195	210		10.3354/meps144195							WOS:A1996WB52100017

These results support previous proposals that the Southern Ocean seabird community is characterised by an ice-associated assemblage and an open-water assemblage, with the species composition of the assemblages reflecting local (Antarctic-resident) breeding species, and the migratory routes and feeding areas of distant-breeding taxa, respectively. Physical environmental covariates such as sea-ice cover, distance to continental shelf and time of year influenced the distribution and abundance of seabirds observed, but the roles of these factors in the observed spatial and temporal patterns in seabird assemblages was confounded by the duration of the survey. Occurrence of a number of seabird taxa exhibited significant correlations with krill densities at one or two spatial scales, but only three taxa (Arctic tern, snow petrel and dark shearwaters, i.e. sooty and short-tailed shearwaters) showed significant correlations at a range of spatial scales. Dark shearwater abundances showed correlations with krill densities across the range of spatial scales examined. (C) 2010 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

A control diet (R0) without AKM and the other five diets with 8.1, 16.2, 24.3, 32.4, and 42.5% AKM supplementation (R10-50) to replace 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50% fishmeal protein were used to feed to juvenile spotted halibut. The juveniles were fed with each diet using three replicates and cultivated in the indoor culture system. Results showed that the specific growth rate, feed intake, and protein efficiency ratio in the R30 and R40 groups were significantly higher than that in other groups (P<0.05). Survival rate in the R50 group was significantly lower compared with the R0 group and the other four AKM supplementation groups. Moreover, the rising AKM levels in diets had significant effects on the chemical composition of juvenile spotted halibut, showing significantly decreased contents of crude protein, but increased lipid and ash contents (P<0.05). The total superoxide dismutase activity and catalase activity of serum and liver in AKM groups were significantly higher than those in the control group (P<0.05). In contrast, the contents of malondialdehyde in serum and liver were significantly lower compared with the control group. These findings illustrate that a moderate AKM level in diets can significantly improve the growth performance, feed utilization, and antioxidative capacity in juvenile spotted halibut, which support the finding that AKM may be used as a good protein source for halibut in the aquafeed industry.																	0893-8849	1749-7345				AUG	2018	49	4					761	769		10.1111/jwas.12455							WOS:000440844200012

Preliminary investigation on the phytoplankton contribution to the mussel diet on the basis of fatty acids analysis	JOURNAL OF THE MARINE BIOLOGICAL ASSOCIATION OF THE UNITED KINGDOM												The composition of fatty acids was studied in the mussels collected in the Mar Grande of Taranto (northern Ionian Sea) during the four seasons. Micro-, nano- and picophytoplankton abundance, biomass and composition have been also evaluated. Fatty acids compositions were investigated for lipid biomarkers to establish the contribution of phytoplankton to the mussel diet. Saturated (SAFA) and monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) were the most abundant components, followed by polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA). The seasonal variations in the SAFAs, MUFAs and PUFAs were not significantly different during the whole study period (ANOVA, P < 0.05). The most abundant identified FAs were 16:0 (27.51 -33.80% of total FAs), 14:1 (3-35-9.91% of total FAs), 18:1n9 (2.92-8-87%), 16:1 n7 (4-53 - 7.61%) and 24:1 n9 (0.43 -8-84%). The most important PUFAs were 22:2 (2-35-3.48% of total FAs) and also 18:2n-6 (1.66-2.61%). PUFAs were characterized. by low percentages of n3 and n6 FAs. Analysis of specific FA markers for diatoms (16:1n7, 20:5n3), phytoflagellates and dinoflagellates (16:0, 18:4113) showed a negligible contribution of phytoplankton to the mussel diet.

J	Wassmann, P; Ratkova, T; Reigstad, M				Wassmann, P; Ratkova, T; Reigstad, M			The contribution of single and colonial cells of Phaeocystis pouchetii to spring and summer blooms in the north-eastern North Atlantic	HARMFUL ALGAE												Studies of the phytoplankton ecology in different localities in north-Norwegian fjords, the White Sea and the Barents Sea were carried out in spring and early summer to investigate the contribution of single and colonial stages of Phaeocystis pouchetii to phytoplankton abundance. Three different types of flagellated and four colonial cells were observed in all localities. R pouchetii was rare under the ice of the Barents and White Seas, but their abundance increased rapidly during ice retreat. Single cell C dominated over colonial cell C, often by 50 times or more. The highest share of colonial cells was encountered in April in northern Norwegian fjords, in May in the Barents Sea and in May-June in the White Sea. At times the single cell dominated the total P pouchetii biomass in Balstjord (April 1999, 2001) with hardly any colonies present. In the White Sea colonies of P pouchetii were less abundant than in the other regions. Cell carbon of P pouchetii colonies appears never to be as dominating in the north-eastern North Atlantic as P. globosa blooms in coastal regions such as the southern North Sea. However, the lobal matrix of P. pouchetii colonies appears to be less solid than that of P. globosa and partly dissolution of the colony matrix during handling and storage of fixes samples induces uncertainty about the absolute numbers of P. pouchetii colonial cell counts. Despite of that, single cells of R pouchetii seem to dominate significantly over colonial cell biomass at most sites and during some years and in some regions colonial cells seem rare. We speculate that top-down regulation of Phaeocystis spp. blooms possibly determines the ratio between single and colonial cells. (C) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Shreeve, RS; Ward, P; Whitehouse, MJ				Shreeve, RS; Ward, P; Whitehouse, MJ			Copepod growth and development around South Georgia: relationships with temperature, food and krill	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												Measurements of egg production rates (EPR) and growth of the early stages of 2 of the Southern Ocean biomass dominant copepods, Calanoides acutus and Rhincalanus gigas, were made over the course of 4 consecutive summer cruises which were carried out in the vicinity of South Georgia. For both species, EPR was found to be weakly but significantly related to chlorophyll a (chl a) although for C. acutus it was below maximum levels recorded in spring. Juvenile mass specific growth rates (g) were found to be body mass, stage and species dependent. Mean g for C. acutus stages CII to CIV decreased from 0.24 to 0.14, and for R. gigas stages Cl to CIII from 0.06 to 0,04, Overall, values for both species were within the range predicted by recent global models of copepod growth. Neither stage duration nor g varied systematically with either temperature (mean, 0 to 60 m) or food (chl a, 0 to 60 m), However, carbon mass of nearly all species stages was negatively and significantly related to silicate levels (Mol m(-2), 0 to 60 m), suggesting the positive effect of past production levels, Ordination of zooplankton species occurrence by station across the survey area indicated that changes in abundance were more pronounced than changes in species composition, and that variation in total copepod abundance was also well explained by silicate levels. Our study indicated that changes in EPR, carbon mass and abundance of copepod populations at South Georgia were all strongly regulated by local primary production. Variation of chlorophyll biomass appeared largely dependent on temperature, rather than grazing pressure exerted by either copepods or krill. Krill at South Georgia were more abundant in colder, silicate replete waters and their presence is presumed to be governed by factors operating at the large scale. In contrast, copepod abundance appeared to differ in response to smaller scale variation in the environment and was linked through silicate to factors determining phytoplankton growth. In turn, chl a concentration was strongly and positively related to habitat temperature. This suggests the importance of the physical environment rather than grazing as ultimate factors controlling phytoplankton biomass in this productive ecosystem.																	0171-8630	1616-1599					2002	233						169	183		10.3354/meps233169							WOS:000176283200014

A detailed analysis of a summer integrated multi-trophic normalized biomass size spectra (NBSS), from heterotrophic bacteria to zooplankton, was carried out. To acquire individual size data, different techniques were combined: flow cytometry for smaller fractions (< 20 A mu m of equivalent spherical diameter), FlowCAM for larger nano- and microplankton and scanning and image analysis for the zooplankton fractions. The distribution of the NBSS was linear at all stations (R-2 values: 0.87-0.93) but dome-shape features appeared related to phytoplankton cell distribution which are responsible for a large fraction of microbial respiration. Generally, the region showed an autotrophic budget south of the archipelago due to gross primary production (GPP) values up to 2804 mg C m(-2) day(-1), where salps could significantly contribute to the carbon export flux. Contrastingly, higher CR rates (> 1000 mg C m(-2) day(-1)) were found at the northern stations due to a higher phytoplankton respiration activity associated with increasing sea water temperatures and a higher presence of heterotrophic organisms (microheterotrophs, chaetognaths and copepods) resulting in a net heterotrophic metabolic state (GPP/CR < 1).

J	Clarke, J; Emmerson, LM; Otahal, P				Clarke, Judy; Emmerson, Louise M.; Otahal, Petr			Environmental conditions and life history constraints determine foraging range in breeding Adelie penguins	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												Foraging movements of Adelie penguins are constrained both by environmental conditions (e.g. sea ice cover) and life history factors (e.g. regular offspring provisioning), We describe within season changes in foraging range, trip duration and body condition of Adelie penguins nesting at Bechervaise Island, East Antarctica, in the context of these constraints. Penguins were satellite tracked over multiple seasons during the incubation, guard, creche and pre-moult phases of their annual cycle. They ranged farthest during incubation when sea ice was extensive and shortest during the guard stage when chicks were small and sea ice limited in extent. Prior to their annual moult the birds foraged hundreds of kilometres to the west and east of their breeding sites. A recurrent polynya facilitated access to the sea early in the season when ice cover was extensive. Kernel analyses showed that penguins foraged most intensively close to the colony, along submarine canyons and at the continental shelf break. Increases in foraging range, as the chick rearing period progressed, were consistent with changing energy requirements of adults and chicks and likely intraspecific competition. Whilst provisioning their offspring, penguins adopted a variable combination of time minimising and food maximising foraging behaviour in which choice of foraging rule was determined largely by adult body condition.																	0171-8630	1616-1599					2006	310						247	261		10.3354/meps310247							WOS:000237558000022						
J	Cherel, Y; Weimerskirch, H; Trouve, C				Cherel, Y; Weimerskirch, H; Trouve, C			Dietary evidence for spatial foraging segregation in sympatric albatrosses (Diomedea spp.) rearing chicks at Iles Nuageuses, Kerguelen	MARINE BIOLOGY												The food of three closely related and sympatric species of mollymawks (Diomedea spp.), the black-browed (BBA, D. melanophrys), grey-headed (GHA, D. chrysostoma) and yellow-nosed (YNA, D. chlororhynchos) albatrosses, was compared at Iles Nuageuses, Kerguelen, during the chick-rearing period. BBA preyed almost equally upon cephalopods (39% by fresh mass), fish (31 %) and penguins (31 %), while GHA fed more on squids (52%, 16% and 28%, respectively) and YNA fed more on fish and not on penguins (13%, 84% and 0%, respectively). Crustaceans were always a minor component of the diet ( < 3%). Patagonian toothfish was the main fish prey, and Todarodes sp. the main cephalopod prey for the community. Accumulated beaks emphasise the importance of juvenile ommastrephid squids in the diet of mollymawks, accounting for 81%, 71 % and 55% of the total number of beaks in BBA, GHA and YNA samples, respectively. BBA preyed also upon a significant number of the octopod Benthoctopus thielei (12%) and of the cranchiid squid Galiteuthis glacialis (4%), while GHA fed more on G. glacialis (18%) and on the onychoteuthid Kondakovia longimana (8%). When feeding on the same prey, prey size was similar for the albatross species. Comparison of overall prey biogeography together with the presence/absence of prey species indicators of water masses indicates segregation through different foraging areas among the three mollymawks. BBA forage almost exclusively over the shelf and upper slope waters surrounding the Kerguelen Archipelago. By contrast, GHA and YNA feed mainly in oceanic waters, YNA favouring the warm subtropical waters, and GHA the cold Antarctic waters. It is thus remarkable that birds from the same breeding grounds forage over such a wide latitudinal range, from about 35-40 S to 60-65 S, encompassing the Subtropical Zone for YNA, the Antarctic Zone for GHA and the Antarctic Polar Frontal Zone (where Kerguelen is located) for the three species.

J	Loeb, VJ; Santora, JA				Loeb, Valerie J.; Santora, Jarrod A.			Climate variability and spatiotemporal dynamics of five Southern Ocean krill species	PROGRESS IN OCEANOGRAPHY												Understanding the ecological response of marine organisms to future climate change will benefit from quantifying spatiotemporal aspects of their distribution and abundance as well as the influence of ocean-atmospheric climate modes on their population cycles. Our study provides a synthesis of 18 years of data (1992-2009) for 5 krill (euphausiid) species monitored near the North Antarctic Peninsula (NAP) during austral summer. Distribution and abundance data are presented for postlarval stages of Euphausia crystallorophias, E. frigida, E. superba, E. triacantha and Thysanoessa macrura and larval E. superba and T. macrura. Intraseasonal, interannual and longer-term distribution and abundance patterns are quantified relative to climate modes driving ecosystem variability off the Antarctic Peninsula: El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), Southern Annual Mode (SAM) and associated zonal and meridional winds. Interannual abundance variations of all 5 species are significantly correlated with seasonally averaged ENSO indices and, with the exception of E. triacantha, elevated population sizes are associated with the higher productivity La Nina phase. Time-lagged responses of each species to ENSO indices approximate their generation times and suggest evolution of their life histories and reproductive efforts in accordance with the ENSO cycle. Postlarval E. aystallorophias and E. frigida and larval T. macrura demonstrate significant abundance increases after 1998 associated with a shift from an El Nino dominated period to predominantly La Nina and "Nino-neutral" conditions. Seasonal changes in species distributions and co-occurrence indicate portions of the southernmost E. frigida, E. triacantha and T. macrura populations move poleward with E. superba during late-summer, suggesting that environmental conditions associated with sea ice development (e.g., food, retention) may be more favorable than within the Antarctic Circumpolar Current during low productivity seasons. Spatial distributions of larval and postlarval T. macrura suggest 2 separate spawning populations within oceanic and coastal waters. Lastly, mean euphausiid species concentrations and abundance relationships encountered during 1992-2009 are remarkably similar to those reported for the Antarctic Peninsula during the 1928-1935 Discovery Investigations. Circumpolar observations of E. superba "superswarms" associated with a major climatically related ecosystem change in the late 1970s may have represented an episodic period of anomalous peak abundance. Subsequent abundance estimates compared to these anomalies would indicate a significant decrease, but should not be taken to reflect the impact of climate warming. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Nutrient digestibility and feed utilization was investigated in salmon and cod. Atlantic cod grew from 186 +/- 29 to 383 +/- 78g (N=960) over 13weeks. Dietary chitin had no effect on length, weight, condition, liver size or specific growth rate (SGR). The apparent digestibility (ADC) for protein ranged from 84.7% to 86.5%, lipid between 88.8% and 93.1% and dry matter from 96.1% to 96.6%. Feed utilization varied between 1.08 and 1.11 and was not correlated with dietary chitin content. Atlantic salmon tripled their weight from 199 +/- 9 to 615 +/- 75g (N=480) during the 13weeks. High inclusions of chitin (>1%) reduced both growth rate and condition. Protein and lipid ADC was negatively correlated with dietary chitin. Feed utilization ranged between 0.86 and 0.90 and was not significantly affected by dietary chitin. Faecal protein increased significantly with increasing dietary chitin, while faecal dry matter and lipid did not. Individually tagged Atlantic halibut grew from 1300 +/- 470 to 2061 +/- 714g (N=70) during 6months. Individual growth rates varied within each group from being slightly negative to 0.81% day(-1). Diet had no significant effect on growth rates. Atlantic cod and Atlantic halibut seems unaffected by up to 5% chitin additions in the diet, while chitin >1% of diet negatively affects growth and nutrient utilization in Atlantic salmon.

A total of 70 species were found, with extrapolations using species accumulation curves suggesting that the true diversity lay between 77 and 90 species. Ciliate abundance and biomass were low, but not unexpectedly so, given the time of year and productivity of the system. Despite the harsh environment, species richness was not less than that found for protists from more temperate habitats, and declined with depth less steeply than abundance and biomass. Ciliate biomass was driven primarily by productivity, with tighter correlations between chlorophyll a (chl a) and either abundance or biomass than those seen from other marine systems. Community composition was also driven by productivity, with a principal components analysis (PCA) on species data showing the first axis strongly correlated with productivity parameters. Moreover, species abundance distributions (SADs) were most often best matched by the geometric distribution, thought to be expected when relatively few parameters determine species distributions. Abundance and diversity were also compared using settled and quantitative protargol stain (QPS) samples. QPS samples had lower mean abundance, higher total species richness and higher taxonomic resolution than did the settled samples. However, per-sample species (or morphotype) richness was the same in settled and QPS samples.

In this study, we analyzed two millennial-scale ornithogenic sediment cores, RNL and RL, from the Vestfold Hills, East Antarctica. Using the Al-normalized phosphorus content of the bulk sediment and carbon/nitrogen fractions in penguin remains, we reconstructed relative changes in the penguin population size of each sub-colony and relative krill abundance in the summer Prydz Bay polynya. Both records are correlated to solar irradiance. At the centennial scale, the penguin population recorded in core RNL decreased from similar to 1120-860 yr BP, reached a peak from similar to 860-630 yr BP, remained at a low level from similar to 630-320 yr BP, and then increased with large fluctuations during the past similar to 400 years. These changes are all in-phase with the trend of solar irradiance. At the decadal scale, penguin population minima correspond to solar minima from similar to 490-400 yr BP (Sporer minimum), similar to 290-220 yr BP (Maunder minimum), and from similar to 160-120 yr BP (Dalton minimum; whereas population maxima correspond to solar maxima from similar to 1030-980 yr BP, similar to 350-290 yr BP, similar to 210-160 yr BP, similar to 120-70 yr BP. The population recorded in core RL exhibited the same changes as in RNL during the last 480 years. The reconstructed krill abundance also corresponds to these trends when data are available. This correspondence demonstrates a food-chain mechanism that is related to solar activity and light availability at the ocean surface, which influence the intensity of photosynthesis and phytoplankton productivity, and thus the abundance of krill and apex predators such as penguins. Our findings highlight the fact that despite the various climatic impacts on penguin populations, their effects on the base of the food chain are usually the direct drive.				xie, zhouqing/P-9661-2019													0031-0182	1872-616X				FEB 15	2019	516						220	231		10.1016/j.palaeo.2018.11.027							WOS:000456903000019

The fatty acid profile of N. australis was markedly unsaturated, with a mean total omega 3 fatty acid content of 48.6+/-2.4% of total fatty acids. N. australis contained high levels of the essential long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids eicosapentaenoic (EPA, 20:5 omega 3) and docosahexaenoic (DHA, 22:6 omega 3), ranging from 16.6 to 36.5% and 11.1 to 24.8%, respectively. The concentration of total carotenoids ranged from 137 to 302 mu g g(-1) dry wt, with no significant differences in concentrations found with season or life stage. The carotenoids were comprised of 79.5% astaxanthin and 20.5% canthaxanthin. The lipid and pigment compositions of N. australis suggest that the species could serve as a suitable feed source for cultured salmonids. Like other euphausiids, N. australis contained high levels of fluoride, with a seasonal range between 277 and 3507 mu g g(-1) dry wt. The high fluoride levels found in N. australis would not detract from its potential as a feed source for salmonids because ingested fluoride is largely absorbed by the skeleton.

J	Genin, A				Genin, A			Bio-physical coupling in the formation of zooplankton and fish aggregations over abrupt topographies	JOURNAL OF MARINE SYSTEMS					11th Annual Meeting of the North Pacific Marine Science Organization	OCT 20, 2002	Qingdao, PEOPLES R CHINA					Aggregations of zooplankton, micronekton and fish are frequently observed above seamounts, canyons and shelf breaks. The aggregations are produced by five different mechanisms, all driven by ocean currents. Upwelling is frequently generated when ambient currents impinge on abrupt topographies. Nevertheless, upwelling enhances local production of zooplankton and fish only over large topographies such as shelf breaks, where the residence time of the upwelled water is sufficiently long to allow enrichment in primary production to propagate up the food web and augment the growth of resident animals. Daily accumulations occur over topographies at shallow and intermediate depths when the topography blocks the morning descent of migrating zooplankton. This mechanism is common over seamounts. Two other mechanisms are driven by behavioural response to vertical currents when zooplankton swims vertically in order to maintain depth: accumulations by depth retention against upwelling are common at depths to which migrating zooplankton descend during the day, while depth retention against downwelling seems to operate only in the upper water column (e.g., along topographically generated fronts). The fifth mechanism is driven by the amplification of currents over abrupt topographies. Strong currents enhance population growth of resident animals by augmenting fluxes of suspended food. A feed-rest hypothesis is proposed to explain how site-attached planktivorous fish can benefit from strong currents at sites with ample quiescence shelters in which the fish rest during nonfeeding, intervals. Four of the above mechanisms generate "trophic focusing", a process by which prey from immense volumes of flowing water is accumulated (or trapped) in a relatively small confined area. The ensuing subsidy of prey propagates up the food web, supporting aggregations of higher predators, such as fish, marine mammals and fishermen. Abrupt topographies can have an important role in determining trophic interactions in the marine realm.

Evaluation of Calanus finmarchicus copepod meal in practical diets for juvenile Atlantic halibut (Hippoglossus hippoglossus)	AQUACULTURE NUTRITION												The copepod, Calanus finmarchicus, has potential as a new ingredient in practical feeds for marine fish. Two experiments were conducted to evaluate the nutritional value of C.finmarchicus meals when fed to juvenile Atlantic halibut. The first study determined protein, lipid and energy digestibility coefficients of four C.finmarchicus meals prepared under different processing conditions. The second study evaluated growth and nutrient utilization efficiency of juveniles fed diets containing varying proportions of fish meal, plant meals and C.finmarchicus meal. Moisture, ash, protein, lipid and gross energy contents of the C.finmarchicus meals were 28-93, 74-138, 505-648, 123-269gkg(-1), and 21-26MJkg(-1), respectively. Protein, lipid and energy digestibilities of C.finmarchicus meals were 91-99%, 90-95% and 90-99%. The digestibilities significantly decreased for the Calanus meals processed at higher temperatures. During the growth study, halibut fed a diet containing 240gkg(-1)C.finmarchicus meal had significantly higher weight gain and growth rate than all other groups. Nitrogen and energy retention efficiencies ranged between 35-45% and 33-43%, and were significantly higher for fish fed 160-240gkg(-1)C.finmarchicus meal than for fish fed plant protein and control diets. The results indicate that growth and nutrient utilization efficiency are improved in Atlantic halibut fed diets supplemented with C.finmarchicus meal.

G.; Duinker, Arne; Sanden, Monica			Undesirables in Mesopelagic Species and Implications for Food and Feed Safety-Insights from Norwegian Fjords	FOODS												The increase in the global population demands more biomass from the ocean as future food and feed, and the mesopelagic species might contribute significantly. In the present study, we evaluated the food and feed safety of six of the most abundant mesopelagic species in Norwegian fjords. Trace elements (i.e., arsenic, cadmium, mercury, and lead), organic pollutants (i.e., dioxins, furans, dioxin-like polychlorinated biphenyls, and polybrominated flame-retardants), and potentially problematic lipid compounds (i.e., wax esters and erucic acid) were analyzed and compared to existing food and feed maximum levels and intake recommendations. Furthermore, contaminant loads in processed mesopelagic biomass (protein, oil, and fish meal) was estimated using worst-case scenarios to identify possible food and feed safety issues. While most undesirables were low considering European food legislation, we identified a few potential food safety issues regarding high levels of fluoride in Northern krill, wax esters in glacier lanternfish, and long-chain monounsaturated fatty acids in silvery lightfish. Our estimates in processed biomass indicated high levels of undesirable trace elements in the protein fraction, frequently exceeding the maximum levels for feed ingredients. However, in fish meal, almost no exceedances were seen. In the oil fraction, dioxins and furans were above the maximum levels, given for food and feed ingredients. The present study is crucial to enable an evaluation of the value of these species; however, more data is needed before proceeding with large-scale harvesting of mesopelagic biomass.

The shift was observed in consecutive years (1991-1996) during the austral summer and was correlated in time and space with glacial melt-water runoff and reduced surface water salinities. Elevated temperatures along the Peninsula will increase the extent of coastal melt-water zones and the seasonal prevalence of cryptophytes. This is significant because a change from diatoms to cryptophytes represents a marked shift in the size distribution of the phytoplankton community, which will, in turn, impact the zooplankton assemblage. Cryptophytes, because of their small size, are not grazed efficiently by Antarctic krill, a keystone species in the food web. An increase in the abundance and relative proportion of cryptophytes in coastal waters along the Peninsula will likely cause a shift in the spatial distribution of krill and may allow also for the rapid asexual proliferation of carbon poor gelatinous zooplankton, salps in particular. This scenario may account for the reported increase in the frequency of occurrence and abundance of large swarms of salps within the region. Salps are not a preferred food source for organisms that occupy higher trophic levels in the food web, specifically penguins and seals, and thus negative feedbacks to the ecology of these consumers can be anticipated as a consequence of shifts in phytoplankton community composition.

J	Benoit-Bird, KJ; Kuletz, K; Heppell, S; Jones, N; Hoover, B				Benoit-Bird, Kelly J.; Kuletz, Kathy; Heppell, Scott; Jones, Nathan; Hoover, Brian			Active acoustic examination of the diving behavior of murres foraging on patchy prey	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												During the 2008 and 2009 breeding seasons of murres Uria spp., we combined visual observations of these predators with active acoustics (sonar), fish trawls, zooplankton net tows, and hydrographic measurements in the area surrounding breeding colonies in the southeastern Bering Sea. We acoustically detected thousands of bubble trails that were strongly correlated with the number of visually detected murres, providing a new tool for quantitatively studying the foraging ecology of diving birds. At the regional scale, the number of acoustically detected bubble trails, which served as a proxy for diving murre abundance, was related to the combined availability and vertical accessibility of squid, krill, and pollock. There were, however, no clear relationships at this scale between diving murres and any individual prey taxon, highlighting the importance of prey diversity to these animals. Individual krill patches targeted by murres had higher krill density and were located shallower than the mean depth of krill patches, but were similar in total krill abundance and overall size. The diving depth of murres within krill patches was highly correlated to the depth of the upper edge of these patches, whereas murres found outside of krill patches showed a depth distribution similar to that of juvenile pollock. Throughout the study area, murres showed strong diel patterns in their diving behavior in response to the diel migrations of their prey. These results suggest that murres select prey with specific patch characteristics implying effective information gathering about prey by murres. The high proportion of diving murres in aggregations and their consistent inter-individual spacing support the hypothesis that intra-specific local enhancement may facilitate foraging in these predators.

Shrimp were reared in tanks for three months, fed either salmon feed or cod, and the fatty acid profile of their muscle tissue was monitored. The salmon feed pellets and cod had completely different fatty acid compositions, with significant differences in most of the analysed fatty acids, eight of them, 14:0, iso 16:0, 16:1n7. 16:2n11, 18:3n3, 20:0, 22:0 and 22:1n11, differing between the two diets by a factor of 10 or more. The levels of the fatty acids in the diets differed also substantially from the levels in the shrimp tissue at the start of the experiment. The shrimp were fed ad libitum and both groups increased significantly in total fatty acid content in the course of the experiment. Nevertheless, the fatty acids made up no more than 6.5 mg g(-1) muscle tissue, with 88 +/- 1% of them bound in polar, membrane lipids. Their composition in the tissue did also change to a certain extent, but the resulting tissue composition did not reflect the fatty acid composition of the diets. Only two fatty acids, 18:2n6 and 18:3n3, clearly followed the dietary level. They are abundant in commercial salmon feed since they are rich in plant oils used as additives to the commercial feed. Determination of fatty acid levels in shrimp tissue may enable shrimp to be used as indicator organisms for the influence of organic fish-farm waste on the food web in adjacent areas.

During spring 1992 (from April to June), algae in the bottom ice layer and those suspended and sinking in the upper water column (top 15 m) were sampled approximately every 4 days. Ice-bottom chlorophyll a reached a maximum concentration of 160 mg m(-2) in mid-May, after which it decreased to lower values. In the water column, chlorophyll a concentrations were low until the period of ice-algal decline (similar to 0.1 mg m(-3)), with most biomass in the <5-mu m fraction. In both the suspended and sinking material, large increases of algal biomass occurred at the 'beginning of June, following the release of ice algae into the water column. The input of ice-algal derived carbon to the upper water column and the proportions exported through sinking or remaining in suspension were assessed using a carbon budget for the two periods of ice-algal growth and decline. For each period the output terms closely balanced the input. The carbon budget showed that most of the biomass introduced into the upper water column remained suspended (>65% of total export) and that ice algae were ingested by under-ice grazers after release from the ice. These results stress the importance of ice algae for pelagic consumers during the early stages of ice melt and show that the transfer of ice algae to higher trophic levels extends beyond the period of maximum algal production in the ice bottom.

Very low values of zooplankton biomass were observed in all the size classes studied. About 56% of total biomass was due to the large size fraction (1-14 mm) while the smallest one (200-500 mu m) accounted for about 26%. Gut fluorescence values increased in relation to the size class considered, as expected, being the differences from the smaller to the highest size fractions of orders of magnitude. Calculated ingestion rates showed that about 60-80% of total zooplankton ingestion(<14 mm) was due to the smaller organisms. Higher average values and higher variability of specific ETS activity was observed in the smaller size fraction while no differences between size classes were observed for the specific ATC activity. Biomass, gut fluorescence, ETS and ATC activities were not significantly different between the Bellingshausen and Weddell waters, although higher standard deviation was normally found at the former area. With the restrictions of using the above indices to estimate physiological rates, potential grazing of mesozooplankton (<14 mm) accounted for a rather low portion (<10%) of the primary production. The index of growth showed high values, suggesting no food limitation of mesozooplankton. Therefore, other processes such as predation should account for the very low biomass found and for the fate of a large portion of primary production.

The following series were included: hydrocarbons, chlorins and chlorin esters, alcohols, sterols, triacylglycerols, free fatty acids and phospholipids. For these major classes, the distribution of their individual components was determined to evaluate the source and fate of each lipid class. Relationships between the lipid composition of overlying particles and of buried material were investigated. The sediment-water interface was found to be of primary importance in the biogeochemical transformations occurring in organic matter, such as loss of the major part of the lipids, and formation of a notable unresolved complex mixture (UCM), of biological origin. Some classes such as chlorin esters appeared to convey their lipid contents from the upper layers without major alteration. In contrast, several other classes, such as storage lipids, appeared to be degraded during sedimentation, indicating extensive recycling of labile lipids in the water column. The burial efficiency and bacterial inputs downcore were highly variable depending on the class considered. Several novel compounds are reported. They consist of alkyl chlorin esters and include a wide variety of saturated and unsaturated long-chain alcohols. Owing to the lack of lipid data in the study area, these results provide an insight into the various biological and chemical processes occurring in open-sea Antarctic sedimentary environments.

This led to the creation in 2003 of a new emerging research field: lipidomics. In particular the phospholipids have pharmacological/food applications, participate in cell signalling/homeostatic pathways while their analysis faces some challenges. Their fractionation/purification is, in fact, especially difficult, as they are amphiphilic compounds. Moreover, it usually involves SPE or TLC procedures requiring specific materials hampering their suitableness for routine analysis. Finally, they can interfere with the ionization of other molecules during mass spectrometry analysis. Thus, simple high-throughput reliable methods to selectively isolate these compounds based on the difference between chemical characteristics of lipids would represent valuable tools for their study besides that of other compounds. The current review work aims to describe the state-of-the-art related to the extraction of phospholipids using liquid-liquid methods for their targeted isolation. The technological and biological importance of these compounds and ion suppression phenomena are also reviewed. Methods by precipitation with acetone or isolation using methanol seem to be suitable for selective isolation of phospholipids in both biological and food samples.

A foodweb model to explore uncertainties in the South Georgia shelf pelagic ecosystem	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY												Foodweb models provide a useful framework for compiling data on biomass, production, consumption and feeding relationships. They are particularly useful for identifying gaps and inconsistencies in the data, and for exploring plausible scenarios of change. We compiled data on the pelagic foodweb of the South Georgia shelf, which is one of the most intensively studied areas in the Southern Ocean. The data suggest that current average annual copepod production is three times that of Antarctic krill and that flying seabirds and fish are, respectively, responsible for 25% and 21% of local krill consumption. The most striking inconsistency was that estimated consumption of fish was 5 times their estimated production. We developed a static mass balance model of the foodweb representing one of many possible solutions to the inconsistencies in the data. The model included sufficient fish biomass to balance the original consumption estimate, and consequently fish became the main krill consumers. Nonetheless, only 74% of local krill production was consumed by predators, suggesting that there are additional mortality sources that we did not explicitly model. We developed further models to explore scenarios incorporating plausible climate-driven reductions in krill biomass. In scenarios with unchanged predator diets, an 80% reduction in krill biomass resulted in a 73% reduction in vertebrate biomass. However, when predators with diverse diets were able to switch to feeding on alternative zooplankton prey, total vertebrate biomass was maintained at current levels. Scenarios in which 80% of krill biomass was replaced with copepod biomass required 28% more primary production because the estimated consumption rate of copepods is higher than that of krill. The additional copepod biomass did not alter the consequences for vertebrates. These scenarios illustrate the wide range of potential consequences of a shift from a krill to a copepod dominated system in a warming climate. They suggest that both maintenance and dramatic reduction of vertebrate production are plausible outcomes, although the former requires major changes in predator diets. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Normally, NaOH and HCl are used to dissolve and precipitate, respectively, fish muscle proteins in isoelectric solubilization/precipitation (ISP), therefore contributing to increased Na content in the recovered fish protein isolates (FPI). Substitution of NaOH with KOH may decrease the Na content in FPI and, thus, allow development of reduced-Na seafood products. In this study, FPI was recovered with ISP using NaOH or KOH. In order to develop a nutraceutical seafood product, the FPI was extracted with NaCl or KCl-based salt substitute and subjected to cold- or heat-gelation. In addition, standard nutraceutical additives (omega-3 fatty acids-rich oil and dietary fiber) along with titanium dioxide (TiO2) were added to FPI. Color, texture, dynamic rheology, Na and K content, and lipid oxidation of the FPI gels were compared to commercial Alaska pollock surimi gels. FPI gels had greater (p < 0.05) whiteness, good color properties (L*a*b*), and generally better textural properties when compared to surimi gels. Although the ISP-recovered FPI and surimi developed similar final gel elasticity, the proteins in FPI and surimi had different gelation pattern. A reduction (p < 0.05) of Na content and simultaneous increase (p < 0.05) in K content of FPI gels was achieved by the substitution of NaOH with KOH during ISP and NaCl with the KCl-based salt substitute during formulation of the FPI paste. Although cooking and addition of NaCl during formulation of the FPI paste increased (p < 0.05) lipid oxidation in FPI gels, TBARS values were much below rancidity levels. These results indicate that KOH can replace NaOH to recover FPI from whole gutted fish for subsequent development of nutraceutical seafood products tailored for reduction of diet-driven cardiovascular disease.

Despite the substantial ecological importance of krill, there are few studies on their distribution and abundance in the TNBP. An acoustic survey was conducted on 7-14 January 2019 in the TNBP, Ross Sea, using a Simrad EK60 echosounder (38 and 120 kHz) aboard the icebreaker RV Araon. The most commonly used range of the difference of the mean volume backscattering strength (MVBS) (2-16 dB) was applied to distinguish krill. The acoustic data (120 kHz) were extracted to examine the krill distribution characteristics. The study area was divided into low-value areas and high-value areas based on the third quartile of the nautical area scattering coefficient. The results showed that the krill aggregations were distributed in three layers at depths of 0-30 m, 70-110 m, and 270-300 m. The interpolated environmental parameters associated with the backscattering strength were compared. High-value areas of krill coincided with relatively low temperature, low salinity, and high chlorophyll, although very weak correlations were found. The primary goal of this study was to understand the vertical and horizontal distributions of krill acoustic biomass and to relate the observed patterns to the dominant environmental conditions.																		2296-7745				NOV 18	2020	7								584550	10.3389/fmars.2020.584550							WOS:000594728800001

The US consumption increased in 1980s; however, it leveled thereafter. Food products nutrified with omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) are in increasing demand due to demonstrated health benefits. Currently, surimi seafood is not nutrified with omega-3 PUFAs. In the present study, surimi seafood was nutritionally-enhanced with omega-3 PUFAs-rich oils (flaxseed, algae, menhaden, krill, and blend). The objectives were (1) chemical characterization of FA composition and oxidation, and (2) determination of physicochemical properties (colour and texture) of the nutritionally-enhanced surimi seafood. Oil addition resulted in increased (P < 0.05) concentration of total omega-3 FAs in surimi seafood; however, the concentration of alpha-linolenic (ALA, 18:3 omega-3), eicosapentaenoic (EPA, 20:5 omega-3) and docosahexaenoic (DHA, 22:6 omega-3) acids depended on which oil was added. Although the omega-3 PUFAs nutrification resulted in increased (Pc 0.05) susceptibility of surimi seafood to lipid oxidation, it was within ranges acceptable to consumers. Texture analysis (texture profile analysis, Kramer shear and torsion test) showed that omega-3 PUFAs nutrification did not affect texture. Colour properties of omega-3 PUFAs nutrified surimi seafood were generally improved except when krill oil or blend was added. This study demonstrates that nutritional value of surimi seafood can be enhanced with concurrent improvement of colour and without affecting texture. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Kiorboe, T				Kiorboe, Thomas			How zooplankton feed: mechanisms, traits and trade-offs	BIOLOGICAL REVIEWS												Zooplankton is a morphologically and taxonomically diverse group and includes organisms that vary in size by many orders of magnitude, but they are all faced with the common problem of collecting food from a very dilute suspension. In order to maintain a viable population in the face of mortality, zooplankton in the ocean have to clear daily a volume of ambient water for prey particles that is equivalent to about 106 times their own body volume. While most size-specific vital rates and mortality rates decline with size, the clearance requirement is largely size-independent because food availability also declines with size. There is a limited number of solutions to the problem of concentrating dilute prey from a sticky medium: passive and active ambush feeding; feeding-current feeding, where the prey is either intercepted directly, retained on a filter, or individually perceived and extracted from the feeding current; cruise feeding; and colonization of large particles and marine snow aggregates. The basic mechanics of these food-collection mechanisms are described, and it is shown that their efficiencies are inherently different and that each of these mechanisms becomes less efficient with increasing size. Mechanisms that compensate for this decline in efficiency are described, including inflation of feeding structures and development of vision. Each feeding mode has implications beyond feeding in terms of risk of encountering predators and chance of meeting mates, and they partly target different types of prey. The main dichotomy is between (inefficient) ambush feeding on motile prey and the more efficient active feeding modes; a secondary dichotomy is between (efficient) hovering and (less efficient) cruising feeding modes. The efficiencies of the various feeding modes are traded off against feeding-mode-dependent metabolic expenses, predation risks, and mating chances. The optimality of feeding strategies, evaluated as the ratio of gain over risk, varies with the environment, and may explain both size-dependent and spatio-temporal differences in distributions of various feeding types as well as other aspects of the biology of zooplankton (mating behaviour, predator defence strategies).

Krill hydrolysate free amino acids responsible for feed intake stimulation in Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar)	AQUACULTURE NUTRITION												The appetite-stimulating effect of krill hydrolysate (KH), free amino acids and specific water-soluble low molecular N-compounds was explored in a short feeding trial with Atlantic salmon. A 100gkg(-1) fish meal positive (MFM), a 30gkg(-1) fish meal negative control (LFM) and six more LFM diets were produced added known attractants for fish-KH at two levels: low (LAK) or high (HAK), AMP, choline chloride (CC); an amino acid mix resembling the free amino acid composition of KH (AA) or a mix of AMP, CC and AA (ACA). HAK, ACA and AA showed highest feed intake and significantly higher plasma phospholipids and cholesterol. The lower performing treatments (LFM, AMP) showed higher liver lipids and hepatosomatic index. CC induced reduced liver lipids and increased plasma phospholipids and cholesterol. Appetite regulating neuropeptide gene expression analysis (qPCR) was performed in fish fed LFM, HAK and AA. Pyy showed the highest postprandial expression in LFM, whereas the expression of the anorexigenic neuropeptides cart, pomca1, pomca2 and pomca2s was low. These apparently contradictory results may be explained by initial appetite stimulation by HAK and AA, resulting in higher feed intake, followed by satiation and appetite downregulation.

SOCIAL AGGREGATION IN THE PELAGIC ZONE WITH SPECIAL REFERENCE TO FISH AND INVERTEBRATES	ADVANCES IN MARINE BIOLOGY, VOL 60	Advances in Marine Biology											Aggregations of organisms, ranging from zooplankton to whales, are an extremely common phenomenon in the pelagic zone; perhaps the best known are fish schools. Social aggregation is a special category that refers to groups that self-organize and maintain cohesion to exploit benefits such as protection from predators, and location and capture of resources more effectively and with greater energy efficiency than could a solitary individual. In this review we explore general aggregation principles, with specific reference to pelagic organisms; describe a range of new technologies either designed for studying aggregations or that could potentially be exploited for this purpose; report on the insights gained from theoretical modelling; discuss the relationship between social aggregation and ocean management; and speculate on the impact of climate change. Examples of aggregation occur in all animal phyla. Among pelagic organisms, it is possible that repeated co-occurrence of stable pairs of individuals, which has been established for some schooling fish, is the likely precursor leading to networks of social interaction and more complex social behaviour. Social network analysis has added new insights into social behaviour and allows us to dissect aggregations and to examine how the constituent individuals interact with each other. This type of analysis is well advanced in pinnipeds and cetaceans, and work on fish is progressing. Detailed three-dimensional analysis of schools has proved to be difficult, especially at sea, but there has been some progress recently. The technological aids for studying social aggregation include video and acoustics, and have benefited from advances in digitization, miniaturization, motion analysis and computing power. New techniques permit three-dimensional tracking of thousands of individual animals within a single group which has allowed novel insights to within-group interactions. Approaches using theoretical modelling of aggregations have a long history but only recently have hypotheses been tested empirically. The lack of synchrony between models and empirical data, and lack of a common framework to schooling models have hitherto hampered progress; however, recent developments in this field offer considerable promise. Further, we speculate that climate change, already having effects on ecosystems, could have dramatic effects on aggregations through its influence on species composition by altering distribution ranges, migration patterns, vertical migration, and oceanic acidity. Because most major commercial fishing targets schooling species, these changes could have important consequences for the dependent businesses.

The western shelf of the Antarctic Peninsula has experiencing increasing air temperatures while the climate is transitioning to a warm-humid sub-Antarctic-type of climate. As a consequence, abiotic changes are leading to alterations in the trophic web. Microphytoplankton FD was analyzed across environmental gradients of sea surface temperature, salinity, meltwater percentage and nutrient availability in Admiralty Bay, South Shetland Islands, Western Antarctic Peninsula. Samples were collected during the austral summer from 2009 to 2011 and from 2013 to 2015, at Admiralty Bay for which FD indices were calculated based on species traits. The amount of meltwater (MW) present in Admiralty Bay groups microphytoplankton into communities according to physiological and ecological tolerances, thus leading to a greater FD. When meltwater dominated the bay (>2.25% MW scenarios iii - 2013-14 and iv - 2014-15), diatoms and dinoflagellates were codominant. An increase in the dinoflagellate fraction of microplankton, notably with auxotrophic and mixotrophic nutrition mode, can be considered a trigger for changes in the structure of the Antarctic food web. Our results suggest using Admiralty Bay as a model for studies on changes in microphytoplankton community composition and FD.				da Cunha, Leticia Cotrim/F-5732-2010; Moser, Gleyci A./ABA-4395-2021	da Cunha, Leticia Cotrim/0000-0001-8035-1430; Moser, Gleyci A./0000-0003-3773-2400													2296-7745				OCT 17	2019	6								638	10.3389/fmars.2019.00638							WOS:000490743000001

The relative importance of sloppy feeding, excretion, and fecal pellet leaching in the release of dissolved carbon and nitrogen by Acartia tonsa copepods	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY												Crustacean zooplankton produce dissolved organic matter (DOM) and inorganic nutrients via sloppy feeding, excretion, and fecal pellet leaching. These different mechanisms of the release of metabolic products, however, have never been individually isolated. Our study was designed to determine the relative importance of these different modes on release of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), ammonium (NH(4)(+)), and urea from Acartia tonsa calanoid copepods feeding on the diatom Thalassiosira weissflogii. Excretion and sloppy feeding were the dominant modes of DOC production (80 and 20% of total DOC release, respectively) and NH(4)(+) release (93 and 7% of total NH(4)(+) release, respectively). Urea, however, was predominately produced via sloppy feeding and fecal pellet leaching (25% and 62% of total urea release, respectively). Urea contributed 20% of total measured nitrogen (TMN; NH(4)(+) + urea) released from copepods, and constituted 100% of TMN released via fecal pellet leaching, 47% of TMN released via sloppy feeding, and only 3.5% of TMN released via excretion. TMN release was >100% of copepod body N d(-1), resulting in low DOC:TMN release ratios (4.1 for sloppy feeding, 2.1 for cumulative release of sloppy feeding, excretion, and fecal pellet leaching). Our results suggest that the mechanism of release plays an important role in the amount of different forms of DOM, NH(4)(+), and urea available to bacteria and phytoplankton. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

J	Constable, AJ; Nicol, S; Strutton, PG				Constable, AJ; Nicol, S; Strutton, PG			Southern Ocean productivity in relation to spatial and temporal variation in the physical environment	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS												[1] The physical factors that have been reported to affect primary and secondary production in the Southern Ocean are examined and critically reviewed. Long time series of physical measurements from the Southern Ocean are available and there is a theoretical base from which models can be constructed. In contrast, there are few large-scale measurements of biological parameters and a paucity of long-term biological data sets for the Antarctic region. The absence of predictive models for the biological systems of the region is underpinned by the absence of theoretical understanding of the variations in the physical environment and their effects on primary, secondary, or tertiary production. To further this understanding, we have examined some of the major seasonal and interannual physical data available for the region (sea ice extent and retreat rate, wind stress, and surface ocean circulation patterns) and have examined their relationship to spatial and temporal variation in satellite-derived proxies of primary productivity (Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS) ocean color data). The results indicate that there are regional differences in the dominant physical forcings and that simple models will fail to replicate the observed patterns of primary production. We have also used the dynamics of Antarctic krill in the South Atlantic as an example to develop a model and explore the various hypotheses that have been put forward to explain interannual variability in this region. Results from this model indicate that the physical system may change in ways that cause periodic shifts in the relative importance of the factors that affect secondary production. The implications for the design of future research programs are explored.

Zooplankton community structure and dominant copepod population structure on the southern Kerguelen Plateau during summer 2016	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY												The influence of environmental factors on the horizontal community structure of zooplankton over the southern Kerguelen Plateau was investigated during summer in 2016. Zooplankton abundance ranged from 1490 to 363,484 ind. 1000 m(-3), with highest numbers observed in the eastern and central areas. Based on cluster analysis the zooplankton were divided into six groups (A-F), and these were only distinguished based on water masses and frontal systems. Groups A to C had abundant zooplankton and were consistent with areas of high chlorophyll a concentration. Group D represented low abundance near the southern Antarctic Circumpolar Current front, while group E was clustered south of the Southern Boundary and group F comprised two stations to the east of the Fawn Trough. Generalised linear model (GLM) highlighted both fronts and chlorophyll a concentration as drivers of overall zooplankton distribution. However, the population structures of key species were more likely a result of species-specific life cycles rather than water masses and frontal systems.

FM is mostly produced from mass-caught pelagic species, but the production has been relatively constant for several decades. The aim of this study was to investigate the potential of dietary krill meal (KM) inclusion as a sustainable alternative to FM. In view of that, a feeding trial with gilthead seabream juveniles was conducted to evaluate whether dietary KM at 3%, 6% and 9% inclusion improves growth performance in comparison with a control diet. At the end of the study, fish in the 9% KM group showed significantly higher body weight (32.76 g) compared with fish fed the control diet (30.30 g). Moreover, FM replacement by 9% KM indicated a reduction in the accumulation of lipid droplets in the hepatocytes and around the pancreatic islets. In summary, this study suggests that FM can be reduced in diets for seabream without negatively affecting growth performance, when KM is added. On the contrary, KM enhances gilthead seabream growth and reduces lipid accumulation and damage of hepatocytes, which will open an interesting innovation line to completely replace FM by alternative terrestrial protein sources and the partial inclusion of KM.

Nutritional composition of potential zooplankton prey of spiny lobster larvae: a review	REVIEWS IN AQUACULTURE												Spiny lobsters are one of the most valuable seafood products in the world. A major bottleneck to the development of commercial spiny lobster aquaculture is a lack of understanding of the natural diet and nutritional requirements of the larvae. Recent studies have identified the varied pelagic zooplankton prey of spiny lobster phyllosoma, which includes gelatinous taxa, such as ctenophores, jellyfish, salps, chaetognaths, polychaetes, siphonophores and radiolarians, as well as crustaceans, such as amphipods, copepods and krill. In light of these studies, the extensive range of published studies on the biochemical composition of zooplankton have been reviewed in an attempt to provide an initial indication of the possible nutritional requirements of spiny lobster phyllosoma, including protein, lipid, carbohydrate, ash and moisture content. The results indicate that protein is the predominant component in all taxonomic groups of potential prey, which is 46.7 +/- 6.0% of dry mass (mean +/- SE) in crustaceans and 18.3 +/- 7.8% of dry mass in gelatinous zooplankton, followed by lipid, which is 23.8 +/- 4.5% of dry mass in crustaceans and 5.3 +/- 1.4% of dry mass in gelatinous zooplankton. Carbohydrate is 1.9 +/- 0.1% of dry mass in crustaceans and 0.9 +/- 0.1% of dry mass in gelatinous zooplankton. Despite the much lower nutrient and energy content of gelatinous zooplankton compared with crustaceans, feeding by phyllosoma on gelatinous zooplankton may provide them more readily accessible nutrients. The results indicate that spiny lobster phyllosoma have a high dietary requirement for protein.

J	Huenerlage, K; Graeve, M; Buchholz, F				Huenerlage, Kim; Graeve, Martin; Buchholz, Friedrich			Lipid composition and trophic relationships of krill species in a high Arctic fjord	POLAR BIOLOGY												Our study deals with the lipid biochemistry of the krill community in the ecosystem of the high Arctic Kongsfjord (Svalbard). During the last decades, Kongsfjord experienced a change in krill species composition due to recent increased advection of Atlantic water masses carrying characteristic boreal as well as subtropical-boreal euphausiids into the ecosystem. The lipid biochemistry and trophic relationships of the species recently inhabiting the Arctic water masses are scarcely known, although a change in a krill population may have a significant impact on the ecosystem. A comparison of nutrition and energy storage strategies, stable isotopes, lipid profiles and fatty acid compositions showed remarkable differences between the krill species. These reflected the diverse feeding behaviours and specific adaptations to the environments of their origin: the boreal Meganyctiphanes norvegica and subtropical Nematoscelis megalops appear more carnivorous and have significantly lower mean lipid contents (29 and 10 %, respectively) and a different energy storage pattern (triacylglycerols and polar lipids, respectively) than the arcto-boreal Thysanoessa inermis, which consists of up to 54 % of lipids mainly stored as wax esters (> 40 %). These differences may have significant implications for the rapidly changing marine food web of Kongsfjord-especially for higher trophic levels relying on the nutritional input of animal lipids.

Large-scale climate and local weather drive interannual variability in Adelie penguin chick fledging mass	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												The fledging mass of penguin chicks can be an indicator of food availability and environmental conditions at a penguin colony. For the period 1989 to 2011, we analyzed predictor variables of environmental and food resource factors acting on multiple spatial scales near Palmer Station, Antarctica, that may influence the interannual variability in Adelie penguin chick fledging mass (CFM). To understand the influence of parental Adelie penguin diet on CFM, we modeled the energy density and krill demographics of penguin diet samples. We found a weak but significant positive relationship between the proportion of immature krill in adult penguin diets and CFM, which may indicate that krill recruitment and prey availability to adults influences CFM. However, the impact of large-scale climate and local weather outweighed the impact of parental diet characteristics on CFM. CFM was negatively associated with a positive Antarctic Oscillation (or Southern Annular Mode) and increased westerly winds and was positively associated with increased air temperature. The mechanistic relationship between climate, local weather, and CFM could include direct and indirect impacts, such as increased thermo-regulative costs for unattended chicks, decreased chick feeding frequency, and smaller meal mass for chicks driven by the geophysical transport of krill by climate and wind events.

However, manufactured fishmeal that is not heated does not undergo thermal denaturation. Few studies have investigated the effects of non-heated animal protein sources on the growth performance of fish. We investigated the effects of heated and non-heated squid and krill meal as diets for red sea bream. Five test diets were formulated to contain heated squid meal, non-heated squid meal, heated krill meal, non-heated krill meal, and fish meal as a control. Fifty fish (initial mean weight = 3.5 g) were distributed in ten 100-l experimental tanks. Fish were fed one of the five diets 3 times daily until satiation for 5 weeks. Regarding growth performance, fish fed the krill meal diet exhibited better growth than those fed squid meal during the first week of the rearing period. However, the squid meal diet group showed better performance than the krill meal diet group during the third week. Moreover, differences in body weight among treatments were greater during the fifth week. Better weight gain and thermal growth coefficient were recorded in the non-heated diet groups than in the heated diet groups. Higher feed intake was observed in the non-heated diet groups than in the heated diet groups. These results suggest higher performance of non-heated squid and krill meal as the protein source of the red sea bream diet. Further, the suitability of the diet type (e.g., squid and krill) might depend on the feeding period and/or developmental stage of fish.

Age determination in crustaceans: a review	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Crustaceans, a commercially important class of arthropods in fisheries and aquaculture, represent a major worldwide food component for human consumption. Recently, growing interest regarding the ageing and longevity of crustaceans has led to advancement in the field of age determination methods, including the use of lipofuscin and growth band counts, veering from the classic approach of size modal analysis. This manuscript provides a comprehensive overview of literature published between 1990 and 2016 on popular age determination methods (length-frequency analysis, lipofuscin analysis, and growth band counts) applied to five main crustacean taxa (shrimp, krill, crayfish, crabs and lobsters). Of the 231 studies examined, 83% used length-frequency analysis, 13% used lipofuscin and 4% used growth bands. Validation, a necessary step to support results provided by age estimation studies, was included in 71% and 56% of the reviewed published papers that used lipofuscin and growth band counts, respectively. So far, growth band counts have been the only direct method of determining crustacean age. This method requires validation in all species before routine application in stock assessment and/or conservation purposes.

J	Ju, SJ; Scolardi, K; Daly, KL; Harvey, HR				Ju, SJ; Scolardi, K; Daly, KL; Harvey, HR			Understanding the trophic role of the Antarctic ctenophore, Callianira antarctica, using lipid biomarkers	POLAR BIOLOGY												To better understand the trophic role of ctenophores in Antarctica during austral fall and winter, a major species of cydippid ctenophore, Callianira antarctica, was collected during April/May (fall) and August/September (winter) 2002 in the vicinity of Marguerite Bay. Lipid content, lipid classes, fatty acids, fatty alcohols and sterols were analyzed in animals, together with lipid biomarkers in krill and copepod species representing potential ctenophore prey. Lipid content in ctenophores collected in winter was slightly higher than from animals in fall (4.8 and 3.5% of dry weight, respectively). Polar lipids were the dominant lipid class in ctenophores, accounting for over half of the lipid content, with significant amounts of free fatty alcohols (more than 10% of total lipid content) detected. Lipid-class composition, however, differed significantly between seasons, with significant amounts of neutral lipid (wax esters and triacylglycerols) only detected in animals from fall. Although the dominant lipid classes in ctenophores varied between fall and winter, individual lipids (i.e., fatty acids, alcohols and sterols) showed only minor changes between seasons. Specifically, long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids [20:5(n-3) and 22:6(n-3)] found in high abundance in larval krill were also elevated in ctenophores collected in winter. Very high amounts of monounsaturated fatty alcohols, particularly 20:1(n-9) and 22:1(n-11), known to be important components of wax esters in calanoid copepods, were also observed. Multivariate analysis using the suite of lipids found indicated that copepods are an important diet item for ctenophores in the study area. Results further suggest that C. antarctica feed actively year-round, with larval krill providing a food resource during austral winter.

In the present study, we evaluated the effects of fluoride on growth performance, thyroid histopathology, thyroid hormone levels, and gene expressions in the HPT axis in male zebrafish (Danio rerio) exposed to different determined concentrations of 0.1, 0.9, 2.0 and 4.1 M of fluoride to investigate the effects of fluoride on thyroid endocrine system and the potential toxic mechanisms caused by fluoride. The results indicated that the growth of the male zebrafish used in the experiments was significantly inhibited, the thyroid microtrastructure was changed, and the levels of T3 and T4 were disturbed in fluoride-exposed male fish. In addition, the expressional profiles of genes in HPT axis displayed alteration. The expressions of all studied genes were significantly increased in all fluoride-exposed male fish after exposure for 45 days. The transcriptional levels of corticotrophin-releasing hormone (CRH), thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), thyroglobulin (TG), sodium iodide symporter (NIS), iodothyronine I (DIO1), and thyroid hormone receptor alpha (TR alpha) were also elevated in all fluoride-exposed male fish after 90 days of exposure, while the inconsistent expressions were found in the mRNA of iodothyroninell (DIO2), UDP glucuronosyltransferase 1 family a, b (UGT1ab), transthyretin (TTR), and thyroid hormone receptor beta (TR beta). These results demonstrated that fluoride could notably inhibit the growth of zebrafish, and significantly affect thyroid endocrine system by changing the microtrastructure of thyroid, altering thyroid hormone levels and endocrine-related gene expressions in male zebrafish. All above indicated that fluoride could pose a great threat to thyroid endocrine system, thus detrimentally affected the normal function of thyroid of male zebrafish.

This article reviews current and expected changes in ASO physical habitats in response to climate change. It then reviews how these changes may impact the autecology of marine biota of this polar region: microbes, zooplankton, salps, Antarctic krill, fish, cephalopods, marine mammals, seabirds, and benthos. The general prognosis for ASO marine habitats is for an overall warming and freshening, strengthening of westerly winds, with a potential pole-ward movement of those winds and the frontal systems, and an increase in ocean eddy activity. Many habitat parameters will have regionally specific changes, particularly relating to sea ice characteristics and seasonal dynamics. Lower trophic levels are expected to move south as the ocean conditions in which they are currently found move pole-ward. For Antarctic krill and finfish, the latitudinal breadth of their range will depend on their tolerance of warming oceans and changes to productivity. Ocean acidification is a concern not only for calcifying organisms but also for crustaceans such as Antarctic krill; it is also likely to be the most important change in benthic habitats over the coming century. For marine mammals and birds, the expected changes primarily relate to their flexibility in moving to alternative locations for food and the energetic cost of longer or more complex foraging trips for those that are bound to breeding colonies. Few species are sufficiently well studied to make comprehensive species-specific vulnerability assessments possible. Priorities for future work are discussed.

J	Huntley, ME; Zhou, M				Huntley, ME; Zhou, M			Influence of animals on turbulence in the sea	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												Analysis of data on the hydrodynamics of swimming by 100 species, ranging in body mass (M) from bacteria to blue whales, leads to a model of animal-induced turbulence in the ocean. Swimming speeds and Reynolds number (Re) are strongly correlated with body mass, both at typical cruising speeds and at escape speeds associated with predator-prey interactions. We find that animals operating at Re > 1000 typically form schools that are concentrated by many orders of magnitude above their average abundance. We calculate the rate of kinetic energy production by 11 representative species of schooling animals ranging in size from euphausiids to whales, and find it to be of the order of 10(-5) W kg(-1), regardless of animal size. Animal-induced turbulence is comparable in magnitude to rates of turbulent energy dissipation (epsilon) that result from major storms. The horizontal length scale (10 to 1000 m) of energy production rate by animal schools is comparable to the observed fine-scale variability in epsilon. We present detailed case studies of 4 species -Atlantic bluefin tuna, Norwegian herring, northern anchovy and Antarctic krill -all of which have schooling behavior that places them within the zone of maximum seasonal stratification where their energy production rate would be 3 to 4 orders of magnitude greater than the background average rate of turbulent energy dissipation. We conclude that schooling animals are an important source of fine-scale turbulent mixing in the ocean, especially in coastal regions during summer.																	0171-8630	1616-1599					2004	273						65	79		10.3354/meps273065							WOS:000222691100006

CHALLENGES TO THE ASSESSMENT OF BENTHIC POPULATIONS AND BIODIVERSITY AS A RESULT OF RHYTHMIC BEHAVIOUR: VIDEO SOLUTIONS FROM CABLED OBSERVATORIES	OCEANOGRAPHY AND MARINE BIOLOGY: AN ANNUAL REVIEW, VOL 50	Oceanography and Marine Biology											All marine species studied thus far show rhythmic temporal patterns in their behavioural, physiological, and molecular functions, which are collectively known as biological rhythms. Biological rhythms are generated by biological clocks that time biological functions and are synchronized by geophysical cycles, such as the solar light-dark cycle and tidal cycle. On continental margins, behavioural rhythms can be detected by diel (i.e., 24-hour based) or seasonal periodical trawling as a consequence of massive inward and outward displacements of populations to and from the sample areas. As a result, significant errors in population/stock and biodiversity assessments performed by trawling may occur if timing of sampling is not taken into account. The increasing number of cabled and permanent multiparametric seafloor observatories now allows direct, continuous, and long-lasting monitoring of benthic ecosystems and analysis in relation to several habitat cycles. This review describes the adaptation of this technology to investigations of rhythmic behaviour by focussing on automated video imaging. Did l fluctuations in the number of video-observed individuals can be used as a measure of average population rhythmic behaviour. The potential implementation of automated video image analysis in relation to animal tracking and classification procedures based on the combined use of morphometric tools and multivariate statistics is detailed in relation to populational and community studies. Based on video cameras mounted at multiparametric cabled observatories, an integrated time-series analysis protocol using chronobiomedical procedures is proposed to place video-recorded bioinformation in an oceanographic context.

Astaxanthin krill oil enhances the growth performance and fatty acid composition of the Pacific whiteleg shrimp, Litopenaeus vannamei, reared under hypersaline conditions	AQUACULTURE NUTRITION												Hypersalinity culture of marine shrimp can lead to poor growth and feed efficiency. This study evaluated the effect of dietary supplementation of three oil sources (krill, fish and soybean) on the growth of Litopenaeus vannamei reared under high salinity. Shrimp of 2.79 +/- 0.60g were reared for 64days under isosmotic (ISO, 23 +/- 1.2g/L) and hyperosmotic (HOS, 44 +/- 2.0g/L) conditions. Diets varied in their fatty acid composition: Control, 35g/kg of the diet (as fed basis) soybean oil; Fish, 27g/kg fish oil and 10g/kg soybean oil; Krill, 48g/kg krill oil and 4g/kg soybean oil; Krill-, 15g/kg krill oil and 21g/kg soybean oil; Krill+, 55g/kg krill oil and 4g/kg soybean oil. At harvest, Krill diet promoted the fastest shrimp growth (1.01 +/- 0.01g/week) and body weight (11.97 +/- 2.01g), regardless of water salinity. There were no significant differences in shrimp survival (93.4 +/- 5.07%) and yield (554 +/- 68.5g/m(2)) among different diets. Shrimp fed Fish, Krill and Krill+ had higher concentrations of PUFA compared to those fed Control and Krill- diets.

Phytoplankton community structure and stocks in the Southern Ocean (30-80 degrees E) determined by CHEMTAX analysis of HPLC pigment signatures	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY												The geographic distribution, stocks and vertical profiles of phytoplankton of the seasonal ice zone off east Antarctica were determined during the 2005-2006 austral summer during the Baseline Research on Oceanography, Krill and the Environment-West (BROKE-West) survey. CHEMTAX analysis of HPLC pigment samples, coupled with microscopy, permitted a detailed survey along seven transects covering an extensive area between 30 degrees E and 80 degrees E, from 62 degrees S to the coast. Significant differences were found in the composition and stocks of populations separated by the Southern Boundary of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (SB), as well as a small influence of the Weddell Gyre in the western sector of the 'zone south of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current' (SACCZ). Within the SACCZ, we identified a primary bloom under the ice, a secondary bloom near the ice edge, and an open-ocean deep population. The similarity of distribution patterns across all transects allowed us to generalise a hypothesized sequence for the season. The primary phytoplankton bloom, with stocks of Chl a up to 239 mg m(-2), occurred about 35 days before complete disappearance of the sea ice, and contained both cells from the water column and those released from melting ice. These blooms were composed of haptophytes (in particular, colonies and gametes of Phaeocystis antarctica), diatoms and cryptophytes (or the cryptophyte symbiont-containing ciliate Myrionecta rubrum). Aggregates released by melting ice quickly sank from the upper water column and Chl a stocks declined to 56-92 mg m(-2), but the bloom of diatoms and, to a lesser extent, cryptophytes continued until about 20 days after ice melt. The disappearance of sea ice coincided with a sharp increase in P. antarctica and grazing, as indicated by increasing phaeophytin a and phaeophorbide a. Chlorophyllide content suggests that the diatom bloom then senesced, probably due to iron exhaustion. Stocks rapidly declined, apparently due to grazing krill that moved southward following the retreating sea ice. We suggest that grazing of the bloom and export of faecal pellets stripped the upper water column of iron (as suggested by low Fv/Fm ratios and CHEMTAX pigment ratios in Haptophytes - iron was not measured). Thus, export of iron by grazing, and possibly sedimentation, created a southward migrating iron gradient, limiting growth in the upper water column. North of the postulated iron gradient, a nanoflagellate community developed at depth, with Chl a stocks from 36-49 mg m(-2). This community was probably based on regenerated production, sustained by residual and/or upwelling iron, as indicated by a close correspondence between distributions of Chl a and profiles of Fv/Fm. The community consisted of haptophytes (chiefly Phaeocystis gametes), dinoflagellates, prasinophytes, cryptophytes, and some small diatoms. Selective grazing by krill may have fashioned and maintained the community. North of the SB, Chl a ranged from 40-67 mg m(-2) and was found predominantly in the mixed layer, but Fv/Fm ratios remained low, suggesting the community of P. antarctica and diatoms was iron-limited. These interpretations provide a cogent explanation for the composition and structure of late summer microbial populations in the marginal ice zone. Crown Copyright (C) 2009 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

J	Ward, P; Atkinson, A; Tarling, G				Ward, Peter; Atkinson, Angus; Tarling, Geraint			Mesozooplankton community structure and variability in the Scotia Sea: A seasonal comparison	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY												Mesozooplankton distribution and community structure was investigated during 3 cruises to the Scotia Sea in austral spring, summer and autumn. Three mesh sizes of Bongo nets were used during each cruise with a 53 mu m mesh net yielding on average 1.76 times higher densities (median 923,000 ind. m(-2), 0-400 m) than a 100 mu m net and 7.42 times more than a 200 mu m net across all cruises. Small copepods dominated numerically across all nets with Oithona spp., Oncaea spp., Ctenocalanus citer and Microcalanus pygmaeus being particularly abundant, with sample densities of up to 3.5 x 10(6) ind.m(-2) recorded within the top 400 m. A more even distribution of biomass among net sizes was apparent, with median net ratios (1.15-1.25) smaller and more even than for abundance. To the south of the Scotia Sea plankton maxima occurred in autumn, consistent with a later spawning in many species, whereas further north, abundance in 53 and 100 mu m nets varied little across seasons, although in the 200 mu m net there was a clear summer maximum. Median biomass increased through summer and by autumn was twice than found during spring in all parts of the Scotia Sea. Cluster analysis indicated two main station groups in all 3 seasons. To the south of the Southern boundary of the ACC (SB-ACC), Group 1 contained stations, that lay within the seasonal sea-ice zone and where zooplankton abundance and biomass was persistently low. In contrast at Group 2 stations, north of the Southern Antarctic Circumpolar Current Front (SACCF) abundance and biomass was consistently higher. Differences between the two groups were largely apparent at the population rather than at the taxonomic level. LHPR hauls to 1000 m indicated that the large seasonal migrant copepods Calanoides acutus and Rhincalanus gigas were at a more advanced stage of development in the north in spring and summer where they were generally present in the upper water column. In autumn, at all stations, C. acutus was dominated by later stages and was dispersed throughout the water column. Calanus simillimus was only abundant at Group 2 stations with older stages dominant in spring and autumn and younger stages in summer. The influence of environmental factors such as sea-ice, temperature and chlorophyll a biomass (Chl a) which may have influenced the development and seasonal succession of zooplankton populations, is briefly discussed.

J	Sewall, F; Norcross, B; Heintz, R				Sewall, Fletcher; Norcross, Brenda; Heintz, Ron			Growth, condition, and swimming performance of juvenile Pacific herring with winter feeding rations	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												Juvenile fish winter mortality, whether through starvation, predation, or disease, depends in part on feeding history. Assessing mortality risk thus requires metrics that can distinguish well-fed from poorly fed individuals. To investigate the effects of winter feeding and spring re-feeding after winter fasting on young-of-the-year Pacific herring (Clupea pallasii), captive herring were maintained on different feeding rations for 20 weeks under ambient winter and spring conditions and evaluated for differences in size, gut mass, RNA/DNA ratio, body composition, and swimming performance. Lipid and moisture levels were inversely related indicators of feeding history, differing most between full-ration and fasted herring. Fasted herring that were re-fed in spring had evidence of compensatory growth without impacting swimming performance. Minimal growth and reduced gut mass observed even among fully fed herring suggest limits to winter feeding benefits. Metabolically processing stored fat rather than foraging and incurring greater predation risk may thus be an advantageous strategy regardless of winter food availability. Mortalities due to starvation and possibly disease were highest among small herring across rations, supporting the importance of size-dependent winter mortality.																	0706-652X	1205-7533				JUL	2021	78	7					881	893		10.1139/cjfas-2020-0293							WOS:000670632700008						
J	Rogers, AD				Rogers, Alex David			Evolution and biodiversity of Antarctic organisms: a molecular perspective	PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES												The Antarctic biota is highly endemic, and the diversity and abundance of taxonomic groups differ from elsewhere in the world. Such characteristics have resulted from evolution in isolation in an increasingly extreme environment over the last 100 Myr. Studies on Antarctic species represent some of the best examples of natural selection at the molecular, structural and physiological levels. Analyses of molecular genetics data are consistent with the diversity and distribution of marine and terrestrial taxa having been strongly influenced by geological and climatic cooling events over the last 70 Myr. Such events have resulted in vicariance driven by continental drift and thermal isolation of the Antarctic, and in pulses of species range contraction into refugia and subsequent expansion and secondary contact of genetically distinct populations or sister species during cycles of glaciation. Limited habitat availability has played a major role in structuring populations of species both in the past and in the present day. For these reasons, despite the apparent simplicity or homogeneity of Antarctic terrestrial and marine environments, populations of species are often geographically structured into genetically distinct lineages. In some cases, genetic studies have revealed that species defined by morphological characters are complexes of cryptic or sibling species. Climate change will cause changes in the distribution of many Antarctic and sub-Antarctic species through affecting population-level processes such as life history and dispersal.																	0962-8436	1471-2970				DEC 29	2007	362	1488					2191	2214		10.1098/rstb.2006.1948							WOS:000250644100003	17553774					
J	Castro, M; Encarnacao, P; Tully, O				Castro, M; Encarnacao, P; Tully, O			The effect of dietary antioxidants on lipofuscin accumulation in the crustacean brain	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY												Lipofuscin accumulation is associated with ageing at the subcellular level. A strong correlation between lipofuscin and age has been found in crustaceans using histological techniques. This association has been proposed as the basis for a methodology to age crustaceans and in some cases lipofuscin levels were found to be better correlated with age than size. The experiment presented here was designed to test the potential effect of diet, in particular dietary antioxidants, on lipofuscin accumulation and age estimation. The shrimp, Penaeus japonicus, was reared in an aquaculture facility and fed commercial pellets, with modified vitamins C and E contents. One group was fed with levels of vitamins C and E of 1000 and 150 mg/kg, respectively, and another group with 2500 and 5000 mg/kg, respectively. The experiment started when the shrimp were 19 weeks old. Samples were obtained at this point and at ages 33 and 43 weeks. Lipofuscin was measured in the nerve cords (antennal neuropils and oesophageal connectives) in an area adjacent to the brain. Dietary antioxidants significantly affected lipofuscin levels. High vitamin content in the diet resulted in lower percentage of the observed area covered with lipofuscin, lower lipofuscin granule density and lower average granule size. Gender had no effect on any of these variables and granule size did not significantly change within each treatment. Lipofuscin area and granule density increased with age in both vitamin treatments. These results suggest that age estimation using lipofuscin indices may be biased when; (1) wild populations are dispersed over diverse environments; (2) the age estimation of wild individuals is based on the results obtained using laboratory-reared individuals.

J	Peijnenburg, KTCA; Goetze, E				Peijnenburg, Katja T. C. A.; Goetze, Erica			High evolutionary potential of marine zooplankton	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION												Open ocean zooplankton often have been viewed as slowly evolving species that have limited capacity to respond adaptively to changing ocean conditions. Hence, attention has focused on the ecological responses of zooplankton to current global change, including range shifts and changing phenology. Here, we argue that zooplankton also are well poised for evolutionary responses to global change. We present theoretical arguments that suggest plankton species may respond rapidly to selection on mildly beneficial mutations due to exceptionally large population size, and consider the circumstantial evidence that supports our inference that selection may be particularly important for these species. We also review all primary population genetic studies of open ocean zooplankton and show that genetic isolation can be achieved at the scale of gyre systems in open ocean habitats (100s to 1000s of km). Furthermore, population genetic structure often varies across planktonic taxa, and appears to be linked to the particular ecological requirements of the organism. In combination, these characteristics should facilitate adaptive evolution to distinct oceanographic habitats in the plankton. We conclude that marine zooplankton may be capable of rapid evolutionary as well as ecological responses to changing ocean conditions, and discuss the implications of this view. We further suggest two priority areas for future research to test our hypothesis of high evolutionary potential in open ocean zooplankton, which will require (1) assessing how pervasive selection is in driving population divergence and (2) rigorously quantifying the spatial and temporal scales of population differentiation in the open ocean.

J	Walsh, JJ; Dieterle, DA; Lenes, J				Walsh, JJ; Dieterle, DA; Lenes, J			A numerical analysis of carbon dynamics of the Southern Ocean phytoplankton community: the roles of light and grazing in effecting both sequestration of atmospheric CO2 and food availability to larval krill	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART I-OCEANOGRAPHIC RESEARCH PAPERS												Reduced ice extent within coastal regions of the Southern Ocean may lead to deeper surface mixed layers (SML), as prevail in offshore areas. A future decline of ice melt-induced stability of the water column may be associated with a shift in dominant food webs, from larger, sun-adapted diatoms grazed by euphausiids to smaller, shade-adapted flagellates consumed by salps. A basically one-dimensional numerical model of three dominant groups of the Antarctic phytoplankton community (diatoms, cryptophytes, and colonial prymnesiophytes) and four types of herbivore (protozoans, salps, copepods, and euphausiids) is used to explore the seasonal importance of both light limitation and grazing pressure on the amount of annual carbon sequestration and larval krill survival within contrasting oceanic and neritic waters, where respective validation data have been gathered during austral spring by the European JGOFS and RACER programs. With imposition of moderate and large grazing stresses, thought to be typical of offshore waters, we were able to replicate the European JGOFS 1992 observations of light penetration, phytoplankton biomass, primary production, pCO(2), bacterial biomass, labile DOG, ammonium, and total particle effluxes at 100 m within the deep SML of our model. The fidelity of such a large set of simulated state variables suggests that multiple limiting factors are indeed operating on different components of the oceanic phytoplankton community - selective grazing losses on the flagellates, but light limitation of diatoms. Release of protozoan grazing pressure in our model instead leads to unobserved spring blooms of cryptophytes, found only in laboratory enclosures. On an annual basis, weak sequestration of atmospheric CO2 is simulated in a habitat typical of the Polar Front, while evasion of carbon dioxide occurs under biophysical conditions of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current. Stratification in shallow SML and the same absolute grazing demands by krill and copepods allows sun-adapted diatoms of our model to bloom at the expense of shade-adapted cryptophytes and prymnesiophytes, eaten by salps and protozoans. We were also able to replicate RACER-I observations of the same suite of variables in 1986-1987, as well as the observed 10-fold range of detrital fluxes caught by other sediment trap deployments during 1980 and 1983 along the Antarctic Peninsula. In western Bransfield Strait, coastal waters are a strong sink for atmospheric CO2 within parcels of Bellingshausen Sea origin, but not perhaps in those from the Weddell Sea, which resemble the oceanic regime of deep SML. We conclude that even in shallow neritic SML. some protozoan rivals of larval krill must still crop flagellates to ensure sufficient abundance of diatom food for both euphausiid survival and possible clogging of the mucous nets of other salp rivals.

Material laid down in otolith nuclei during early life showed (i) strong heterogeneity between the Antarctic Peninsula and South Georgia consistent with a population boundary, (ii) evidence of finer-scale heterogeneity between sampling areas on the Antarctic Peninsula, and (iii) similarity between the eastern and northern shelves of South Georgia, indicating a single, self-recruiting population there. Consistent with the otolith chemistry, simulations of the large-scale circulation predicted that particles released at depths of 100-300 m on the Antarctic Peninsula shelf during spring, corresponding to hatching of icefish larvae from benthic nests, are transported in the southern ACC, missing South Georgia but following trajectories along the southern Scotia Ridge instead. These results suggest that the timing of release and position of early life stages in the water column substantially influence the direction and extent of connectivity. Used in complement, the two techniques promise an innovative approach for generating and testing predictions to resolve early dispersal and connectivity of populations related to the physical circulation of oceanic systems.

Acoustic insights into the zooplankton dynamics of the eastern Weddell Sea	PROGRESS IN OCEANOGRAPHY												The success of any efforts to determine the effects of climate change on marine ecosystems depends on understanding in the first instance the natural variations, which contemporarily occur on the interannual and shorter time scales. Here we present results on the environmental controls of zooplankton distribution patterns and behaviour in the eastern Weddell Sea, Southern Ocean. Zooplankton abundance and vertical migration are derived from the mean volume backscattering strength (MVBS) and the vertical velocity measured by moored acoustic Doppler current profilers (ADCPs), which were deployed simultaneously at 64 degrees S, 66.5 degrees S and 69 degrees S along the Greenwich Meridian from February, 2005, until March, 2008. While these time series span a period of full three years they resolve hourly changes. A highly persistent behavioural pattern found at all three mooring locations is the synchronous diel vertical migration (DVM) of two distinct groups of zooplankton that migrate between a deep residence depth during daytime and a shallow depth during nighttime. The DVM was closely coupled to the astronomical daylight cycles. However, while the DVM was symmetric around local noon, the annual modulation of the DVM was clearly asymmetric around winter solstice or summer solstice, respectively, at all three mooring sites. DVM at our observation sites persisted throughout winter, even at the highest latitude exposed to the polar night. Since the magnitude as well as the relative rate of change of illumination is minimal at this time, we propose that the ultimate causes of DVM separated from the light mediated proximal cue that coordinates it. In all three years, a marked change in the migration behaviour occurred in late spring (late October/early November), when DVM ceased. The complete suspension of DVM after early November is possibly caused by the combination of two factors: (1) increased availability of food in the surface mixed layer provided by the phytoplankton spring bloom, and (2) vanishing diurnal enhancement of the threat from visually oriented predators when the illumination is quasi-continuous during the polar and subpolar summer. Zooplankton abundance in the water column, estimated as the mean MVBS in the depth range 50-300 m, was highest end of summer and lowest mid to end winter on the average annual cycle. However, zooplankton abundance varied several-fold between years and between locations. Based on satellite and in situ data of chlorophyll and sea ice as well as on hydrographic measurements, the inter annual and spatial variations of zooplankton mean abundance can be explained by differences in the magnitude of the phytoplankton spring bloom, which develops during the seasonal sea ice retreat. Whereas the vernal ice melt appears necessary to stimulate the blooming of phytoplankton, it is not the determinator of the blooms magnitude, its areal extent and duration. A possible explanation for the limitation of the phytoplankton bloom in some years is top-down control. We hypothesise that the phytoplankton spring development can be curbed by grazing when the zooplankton had attained high abundance by growth during the preceding summer. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

J	HUNT, GL				HUNT, GL			MARINE ECOLOGY OF SEABIRDS IN POLAR OCEANS	AMERICAN ZOOLOGIST												Patterns of seabird species' distributions differ between the Antarctic and the Arctic. In the Antarctic, distributions are annular or latitudinal, with strong similarities in species composition of seabird communities in all ocean basins at a given latitude. In the Arctic, communities are arranged meridionally, and show strong differences between ocean basins and, at a given latitude, between sides of ocean basins. these differences between the seabird communities in the Northern Hemisphere and the Southern Hemisphere reflect differences in the patterns of flow of major ocaen current systems. At smaller spatial scales, in both hemispheres the species composition of seabird communities is sensitive to changes in watermass characteristics. The distribution of avian biomass is affected by both physical and biological features of the ocean. In the Antarctic, much seabird foraging is over deep water, and within-season, small-scale patchiness in prey abundance and availability in ice-free waters is likely to be controlled primarily by the behavior of the prey, rather than by physical features. Thus, prey availability may be unpredictable in time and space. In contrast, in the Northern Hemisphere, most seabird foraging is concentrated over shallow continental shelves, where currents interact with bathymetry to produce predictable physical features capable of concentrating prey or making prey more easily harvested by seabirds. Ice cover appears to be the most important physical feature in the Antarctic. An entire community of birds is specialized to use prey taken near the ice edge. These prey consist of a variety of species, some of which are normally found much deeper in the water than the birds taking them can dive. The open-water portion of the marginal ice zone is also an important foraging habitat for Antarctic marine birds. In the Arctic, a food web based on underice algae is used by marine birds, but few if any data exist on avian use of the open water segment of the marginal ice zone. Recent simultaneous surveys of birds and their prey indicate that only rarely does the small-scale abundance of birds match that of their prey; correlations between predators and prey are generally stronger at larger scales. Evidence is accumulating in the Antarctic that the largest aggregations of krill may be disproportionately important to foraging seabirds.

Interactive effects of iron, irradiance and CO2 on Ross Sea phytoplankton	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART I-OCEANOGRAPHIC RESEARCH PAPERS												We conducted a factorial shipboard continuous culture experiment to examine the interactive effects of altered iron, irradiance and CO2 on the summer phytoplankton community of the Ross Sea, Antarctica. After 18 days of continuous incubation, iron enrichment increased phytoplankton biomass, nutrient drawdown, diatom and Phaeocystis abundance, and some photosynthetic parameters. High irradiance significantly increased the number of Phaeocystis antarctica colonies, as well as P. antarctica abundance relative to diatoms. Iron and light had significant interactive effects on diatom and P. antarctica pigment concentrations. P. antarctica colony abundance, and Si:N, Si:C, and N:P ratios. The major influence of high CO2 was on diatom community structure, by favoring the large centric diatom Chaetoceros lineola over the small pennate species Cylindrotheca closterium. The ratio of centric to pennate diatoms was significantly responsive to changes in all three variables individually, and to all of their possible two- and three-way combinations. These results suggest that shifts in light, iron, and CO2 and their mutual interactions all play a role in controlling present day Ross Sea plankton community structure, and need to be considered when predicting the possible future responses of biology and biogeochemistry in this region.

J	Le Fevre, J; Legendre, L; Rivkin, RB				Le Fevre, J; Legendre, L; Rivkin, RB			Fluxes of biogenic carbon in the Southern Ocean: roles of large microphagous zooplankton	JOURNAL OF MARINE SYSTEMS					International JGOFS Symposium on Carbon Fluxes and Dynamic Processes in the Southern Ocean - Present and Past	AUG 28-31, 1995	BREST, FRANCE	European Inst Marine Studies, Univ W Brittany				The Southern Ocean is an extreme environment, where waters are permanently cold, a seasonal ice cover extends over large areas, and the solar energy available for photosynthesis is severely restricted, either by vertical mixing to considerable depths or, especially south of the Antarctic Circle, by prolonged seasonal periods of low or no irradiance. Such conditions would normally lead to low productivity and a water column dominated by recycling processes involving microbial components of pelagic communities but this does not seem to be the case in the Southern Ocean, where there is efficient export to large apex predators and deep waters. This paper investigates the role of large microphagous zooplankton (salps, krill, and some large copepods) in the partitioning of biogenic carbon among the pools of short- and long-lived organic carbon and sequestered biogenic carbon. Large microphagous zooplankton are able to ingest microbial-sized particles and thus repackage small, non-sinking particles into both metazoan biomass and large, rapidly sinking faeces. Given the wide spatio-temporal extent of microbial trophic pathways in the Southern Ocean, large zooplankton that are omnivorous or able to ingest small food particles have a competitive advantage over herbivorous zooplankton. Krill efficiently transfer carbon to a wide array of apex predators and their faecal pellets are exported to depth during occasional brief sedimentation episodes in spring time. Salps may be a significant link towards some fish (directly) and other apex predators (indirectly) and, at some locations (especially in offshore waters) and time, they may account for most of the downward flux of biogenic carbon. Large copepods are a trophic link towards fish and at least one whale species, and their grazing activity generally impedes the export of organic particles to depth. As a result, biogenic carbon is channelled mainly towards apex predators and episodically into the deep ocean. Without these original interactions, Antarctic waters might well be dominated by microbial components and recycling processes instead of active export from the generally small primary producers towards large apex predators.																	0924-7963					NOV	1998	17	1-4					325	345		10.1016/S0924-7963(98)00047-5							WOS:000077463500023

Feeding dynamics	MARINE BIOLOGY												Feeding dynamics of the Antarctic salps Ihlea racovitzai and Salpa thompsoni were studied in the Lazarev Sea in fall 2004, summer 2005-2006 and winter 2006. Pigment concentrations in the guts of both species were positively correlated with ambient surface chlorophyll a (chl a). No evidence was found for salp clogging even at dense surface concentrations of up to 7 mu g chl a L-1. However, gut pigment concentrations had a lower range than ambient pigment concentrations, suggesting that salps increased retention times of ingested material in low-food environments. For medium-sized I. racovitzai and S. thompsoni, estimated individual daily rations reached 7-10 and > 100% of body carbon in winter and summer, respectively. Daily respiratory needs of I. racovitzai and S. thompsoni accounted for 28 and 22% of daily carbon assimilation based on pigment ingestion rates in winter, and for 2 and 1% in summer, respectively. The grazing impact of the salp populations on the phytoplankton standing stock was negligible during all seasons due to generally low salp densities. Fatty acid trophic biomarkers in the salps suggest high year-round contributions of flagellates and modest contributions of diatoms to the salp's diet. These markers showed low seasonal variability for I. racovitzai. The more pronounced seasonality of trophic markers in S. thompsoni were likely related to their generally deeper residence depth in winter linked to a seasonal alternation of sexual and asexual generations.

Developing integrated models of Southern Ocean food webs: Including ecological complexity, accounting for uncertainty and the importance of scale	PROGRESS IN OCEANOGRAPHY												The Southern Ocean supports diverse and unique ecosystems that have been impacted by more than two centuries of exploitation and are now experiencing rapid changes in ocean temperature and seasonal ice cover due to climate warming. Understanding and projecting responses of Southern Ocean marine ecosystems to changing climate conditions and direct human impacts, such as fisheries, requires integrated ecosystem analyses at scales previously unexplored. Here we consider the main ecological and modelling challenges in predicting the responses of Southern Ocean ecosystems to change, and propose three inter-linked focus areas that will advance the development of integrated models for Southern Ocean ecosystems. The first focus area is development of fundamental understanding of the factors that determine the structure and function of the food webs at multiple scales. Ecological research in the Southern Ocean is often centred on key species or localised systems, a tendency which is reflected in existing food web and ecosystem models. To build on this, a systematic analysis of regional food web structure and function is required. The second focus area is development of a range of mechanistic models that vary in their resolution of ecological processes, and consider links across physical scales, biogeochemical cycles and feedbacks, and the central role of zooplankton. These two focus areas underlie the third, which is development of methodologies for scenario testing across a range of trophic levels of the effects of past and future changes, which will facilitate consideration of the underlying complexity of interactions and the associated uncertainty. The complex nature of interactions determining Southern Ocean ecosystem structure and function will require new approaches, which we propose should be developed within a scale-based framework that emphasises both physical and ecological aspects.

J	FORTIER, L; LEFEVRE, J; LEGENDRE, L				FORTIER, L; LEFEVRE, J; LEGENDRE, L			EXPORT OF BIOGENIC CARBON TO FISH AND TO THE DEEP-OCEAN - THE ROLE OF LARGE PLANKTONIC MICROPHAGES	JOURNAL OF PLANKTON RESEARCH												The turnover time of biogenic carbon in the ocean can be defined as the time elapsed between the photosynthetic uptake of dissolved inorganic carbon and the return of this carbon as CO2 in surface waters or the atmosphere. Three compartments can be defined: short-lived carbon (<10(-2) year), long-lived carbon (10(-2)-10(2) years) and carbon sequestered in deep water or sediments. Pelagic organisms that package small particles into larger ones lengthen the turnover time of biogenic carbon and, in some cases. transfer this carbon from a given compartment to a longer-lived one. The lengthening of turnover time should be a direct function of the ratio between the size of organisms and that of their food particles. Under some circumstances. large species of euphausiids and copepods, in the North Pacific and the Southern Ocean, contribute to the lengthening of carbon turnover time. However, the most efficient re-packagers of small particles into larger ones are salps, appendicularians, doliolids and thecosome pteropods. which feed on particles at least 3.5 orders of magnitude smaller than their own size. It is hypothesized that the capacity of these large microphages to swarm explosively allows them to control phytoplankton blooms and prevent the development of particle concentrations that could clog their filtering apparatus. Salps. appendicularians and, to some degree, thecosome pteropods are frequent in the diet of some larval and adult fish, and thus contribute to some extent to the direct transformation of short-lived microbial carbon into longer-lived harvestable resources. Yet, the main ecological role of large non-crustacean microphages may reside in the production of fast-sinking, resistant, faecal pellets (in particular those of oceanic salps) that often make up the bulk of the vertical flux of organic material into deep waters, where biogenic carbon can be sequestered for long periods.																	0142-7873	1464-3774				JUL	1994	16	7					809	839		10.1093/plankt/16.7.809							WOS:A1994NZ20000006

The objective was to determine chemical properties of heat-set gels made of the ISP protein isolate fortified with omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs)-rich oils (flaxseed, fish, algae, krill, and blend). The extent of the PUFAs increase, omega-6/omega-3 FAs and unsaturated/saturated FM ratios, and the indices of thrombogenicity and atherogenicity depended on specific omega-3 PUFAs-rich oil used to fortify protein isolate gels. Lipid oxidation in omega-3 PUFAs fortified gels was minimal, although greater (P < 0.05) than control gels (without omega-3 PUFAs fortification). However, all gels were in the slightly rancid, but acceptable range. The commonly used thiobarbituric-acid-reactive-substances (TBARS) assay to determine lipid oxidation in seafood may be inaccurate for samples containing krill oil due to its red pigment, astaxanthin. Protein degradation (total-volatile-basic-nitrogen) was greater (P < 0.05) in omega-3 PUFAs fortified gels than control gels. However, all gels were considerably below the acceptability threshold for protein degradation. The shear stress of omega-3 PUFAs fortified gels was generally greater than the control gels and the shear strain was generally unchanged. This study demonstrates that omega-3 PUFAs fortification of protein isolates recovered with ISP from fish processing by-products or whole fish has potential application in the development of functional foods.

A.; Schloss, Irene R.; Marshall, Tanya; Flynn, Raquel; Smith, Shantelle			Changing Biogeochemistry of the Southern Ocean and Its Ecosystem Implications	FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE												The Southern Ocean plays a critical role in regulating global climate as a major sink for atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2), and in global ocean biogeochemistry by supplying nutrients to the global thermocline, thereby influencing global primary production and carbon export. Biogeochemical processes within the Southern Ocean regulate regional primary production and biological carbon uptake, primarily through iron supply, and support ecosystem functioning over a range of spatial and temporal scales. Here, we assimilate existing knowledge and present new data to examine the biogeochemical cycles of iron, carbon and major nutrients, their key drivers and their responses to, and roles in, contemporary climate and environmental change. Projected increases in iron supply, coupled with increases in light availability to phytoplankton through increased near-surface stratification and longer ice-free periods, are very likely to increase primary production and carbon export around Antarctica. Biological carbon uptake is likely to increase for the Southern Ocean as a whole, whilst there is greater uncertainty around projections of primary production in the Sub-Antarctic and basin-wide changes in phytoplankton species composition, as well as their biogeochemical consequences. Phytoplankton, zooplankton, higher trophic level organisms and microbial communities are strongly influenced by Southern Ocean biogeochemistry, in particular through nutrient supply and ocean acidification. In turn, these organisms exert important controls on biogeochemistry through carbon storage and export, nutrient recycling and redistribution, and benthic-pelagic coupling. The key processes described in this paper are summarised in the Graphical Abstract. Climate-mediated changes in Southern Ocean biogeochemistry over the coming decades are very likely to impact primary production, sea-air CO2 exchange and ecosystem functioning within and beyond this vast and critically important ocean region.

Standard Rectangular Midwater Trawl net tows were carried out at midnight and midday stations between 20degrees and 70degreesW south of the Polar Front. The overall mean numerical density and biomass of krill estimated from nets (247 krill per 1000 m(3) and 18.7 g m(-2), respectively) were similar to lower values reported previously for the Southwest Atlantic, and comparable with high values for other regions of the Southern Ocean. Krill varied in mean size across the survey area, with cluster analyses showing three distinct groups of length-frequency distribution. Small juvenile and immature krill occurred east of the South Orkney Islands. Adult krill < 50 mm dominated the shelf areas of the Antarctic Peninsula and to the north of the juvenile stock across the Scotia Sea. Adult krill > 50 mm were mostly restricted to the west of the South Orkney Islands. Maturity stage composition indicated that peak spawning occurred before early February. Distribution of the spawning stock showed two hotspots, the first between the South Shetland and South Orkney Islands, and the second around the South Sandwich Islands. Reproductive krill were largely absent in the central Scotia Sea and around South Georgia. Krill larvae concentrations occurred slightly to the east of the spawning stock. Mean density of larvae in the western Scotia Sea was 2044 m(-2), but only scattered aggregations of larvae were recorded east of 36degreesW (2 m(-2)). Recruitment indices for 1- and 2-year-old krill were low in the western part of the survey area, the outflow from the Bellingshausen Sea/Antarctic Peninsula region (R-1 = 0.0, R-2 = 0.11) indicating spawning failure and/or poor recruitment for several years. In the eastern part of the survey area, mostly the outflow of the Weddell Sea, recruitment indices were high and above the long-term average (R-1 = 0.60, R-2 = 0.72), suggesting a population with constant and successful reproduction, recruitment and mortality. The distribution and structure of the krill population did not show any clear relationship to the position of the major oceanic fronts in the Scotia Sea. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

Antarctic seals: Molecular biomarkers as indicators for pollutant exposure, health effects and diet	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Weddell (Leptonychotes weddellii), Ross (Ommatophoca rossii) and crabeater seals (Lobodon carcinophaga) are phocid seals with a circumpolar distribution around Antarctica. As long-lived and large top predators, they bioaccumulate contaminants and are considered as sentinels of ecosystem health. Antarctic seals are increasingly exposed to climate change, pollution, shipping and fisheries. To reveal and understand possible anthropogenic impacts on their immune and health status, this study investigates sensitive biomarkers of the xenobiotic metabolism and immune system in relation to mercury (Hg) burden. Gene-transcription studies using minimally invasive blood samples are useful to monitor physiological processes in wildlife that can be related to different stressors. Blood samples of 72 wild-caught seals (Weddell n = 33; Ross n = 12; crabeater n = 27) in the Amundsen and Ross Seas in 2008-2011 were investigated. Copy numbers per mu l mRNA transcription of xenobiotic biomarkers (aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR)), aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator (ARNT) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR alpha) and immune relevant cell mediators (cytokines interleukin-2 (IL-2), interleukin-10 (IL-10) and heat-shock-protein 70 (HSP70)) were measured using reference genes Tyrosine 3-monooxygenase/tryptophan 5-monooxygenase activation protein, zeta polypeptide (YWHAZ) and ribosomal protein L4 (RPL4) by real time RT-qPCR. Hg concentration was analysed in fur. Hg concentration increased with body weight and standard length in all species. Crabeater seals showed a lower Hg concentration than Ross and Weddell seals. Species-specific differences in gene-transcription were found between all species with highest levels of AHR, ARNT and PPARa in crabeater seals. Ross seals showed highest IL-10 and HSP70 transcription, while HSP70 was exceptionally low in crabeater seals. Between Hg and HSP70 a clear negative relationship was found in all species. The species-specific, age and sex-dependent gene-transcription probably reflect dietary habits, pollutant exposure and immune status. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier B.V.

Crustacea in Arctic and Antarctic sea ice: Distribution, diet and life history strategies	ADVANCES IN MARINE BIOLOGY, VOL 51	Advances in Marine Biology											This review concerns crustaceans that associate with sea ice. Particular emphasis is placed on comparing and contrasting the Arctic and Antarctic sea ice habitats, and the subsequent influence of these environments on the life history strategies of the crustacean fauna. Sea ice is the dominant feature of both polar marine ecosystems, playing a central role in physical processes and providing an essential habitat for organisms ranging in size from viruses to whales. Similarities between the Arctic and Antarctic marine ecosystems include variable cover of sea ice over an annual cycle, a light regimen that can extend from months of total darkness to months of continuous light and a pronounced seasonality in primary production. Although there are many similarities, there are also major differences between the two regions: The Antarctic experiences greater seasonal change in its sea ice extent, much of the ice is over very deep water and more than 80% breaks out each year. In contrast, Arctic sea ice often covers comparatively shallow water, doubles in its extent on an annual cycle and the ice may persist for several decades. Crustaceans, particularly copepods and amphipods, are abundant in the sea ice zone at both poles, either living within the brine channel system of the ice-crystal matrix or inhabiting the ice-water interface. Many species associate with ice for only a part of their life cycle, while others appear entirely dependent upon it for reproduction and development. Although similarities exist between the two faunas, many differences are emerging. Most notable are the much higher abundance and biomass of Antarctic copepods, the dominance of the Antarctic sea ice copepod fauna by calanoids, the high euphausiid biomass in Southern Ocean waters and the lack of any species that appear fully dependent on the ice. In the Arctic, the ice-associated fauna is dominated by amphipods. Calanoid copepods are not tightly associated with the ice, while harpacticoids and cyclopoids are abundant. Euphausiids are nearly absent from the high Arctic. Life history strategies are variable, although reproductive cycles and life spans are generally longer than those for temperate congeners. Species at both poles tend to be opportunistic feeders and periods of diapause or other reductions in metabolic expenditure are not uncommon.

The quantification of the autofluorescent age pigment, lipofuscin. has revealed promising results in boreal and tropical species. We studied the presence of morphological lipofuscin and its possible application as an age marker in five Arctic and five Antarctic species. comprising decapods, amphipods and a euphausiid. Lipofuscin granules were located in the brain, using confocal fluorescence microscopy, and quantified from digital images. The pigment was found in 94 of 100 individuals and in all 10 species, and granules occurred in easily detectable amounts in 5 species. Two scavenging amphipod species, the Antarctic Waldeckia obesa and the Arctic Eurythenes gryllus, revealed the most conspicuous and numerous granules. There was a broad, though weak, correlation of lipofuscin concentration with individual body size within a species, but not with absolute body size of one species compared to another. In larvae of the decapod Chorismus antarcticus, lipofuscin accumulation was quantified over the 1st 4 months after larval release. Morphological lipofuscin is a potential index of age in those investigated species with a sufficient accumulation rate of the pigment.

The South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands MPA: Protecting A Biodiverse Oceanic Island Chain Situated in the Flow of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current	MARINE MANAGED AREAS AND FISHERIES	Advances in Marine Biology											South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands (SGSSI) are surrounded by oceans that are species-rich, have high levels of biodiversity, important endemism and which also support large aggregations of charismatic upper trophic level species. Spatial management around these islands is complex, particularly in the context of commercial fisheries that exploit some of these living resources. Furthermore, management is especially complicated as local productivity relies fundamentally upon biological production transported from outside the area. The MPA uses practical management boundaries, allowing access for the current legal fisheries for Patagonian toothfish, mackerel icefish and Antarctic krill. Management measures developed as part of the planning process designated the whole SGSSI Maritime Zone as an IUCN Category VI reserve, within which a number of IUCN Category I reserves were identified. Multiple-use zones and temporal closures were also designated. A key multiple-use principle was to identify whether the ecological impacts of a particular fishery threatened either the pelagic or benthic domain.				, Martin/ABE-6728-2020; Collins, Martin A/J-8560-2017	Staniland, Iain/0000-0003-2736-9134												0065-2881		978-0-12-800214-8				2014	69						15	78		10.1016/B978-0-12-800214-8.00002-5							WOS:000349890300003	25358297					
J	Thorpe, JP; Sole-Cava, AM; Watts, PC				Thorpe, JP; Sole-Cava, AM; Watts, PC			Exploited marine invertebrates: genetics and fisheries	HYDROBIOLOGIA					International Workshop on Marine Genetics	SEP, 1998	RIO JANEIRO, BRAZIL					The application of genetic techniques to invertebrate fisheries is in many ways essentially similar to that in vertebrate (i.e. finfish) fisheries, for which there is already an extensive body of published data. However, there are also relative differences which lead to particular problems in the use of genetic data to study commercially important invertebrate species. The main role for genetics of both vertebrates and invertebrates has been, and is likely to continue to be, the identification of groups of interbreeding individuals as the basis for a fishery. It is in the identification of the breeding unit that the genetic differences between vertebrates and invertebrates can be of practical significance. The genetic breeding unit, usually called a 'stock' in fisheries biology, generally shows a certain uniformity of size in most marine fish which have been studied. Smaller or less mobile fish (e.g. flatfish) may only range a few tens of kilometres to their breeding grounds, whilst in more mobile, particularly migratory pelagic species (e.g. Scombridae), the area occupied by a stock is likely to be far greater and for a few (e.g. large pelagic elasmobranchs), a single unit of stock may be almost circumglobal. However, marine fish generally, particularly those large or plentiful enough to be of commercial interest, are likely to be fairly mobile and in many cases the order of mobility is likely to be in the region we might predict from our knowledge of the biology and habits of the species. In the genetic assessment of 'stocks' for invertebrate fisheries, we face a number of additional problems, mostly related to the large evolutionary range of invertebrates exploited and their widely different biology. Although in Europe and North America marine invertebrate fisheries may be thought of as being mainly for decapod crustaceans and bivalve molluscs, globally commercially important marine invertebrate fisheries range from sponges to squid and include such diverse groups as sea cucumbers, barnacles, krill, octopuses, cuttlefish, sea anemones, ascidians, polychaetes, sea urchins, gastropods and jellyfish. An obvious feature of many of these invertebrates is that the adult (i.e. commercial) stage of the life cycle is sessile (e.g. barnacles, sponges, ascidians) or of very limited mobility (e.g. sea anemones, sea urchins, bivalves, gastropods), with the result that the dispersive phase of the life cycle is the larva. Other groups (e.g. krill, jellyfish) are planktonic or nektonic and may cover very large distances, but, unlike fish, have little control over the distance or direction of travel, whilst some of the open ocean pelagic squid are more mobile than most fish and may migrate thousands or kilometres to spawning grounds. The very low mobility of both larva and adult in some invertebrates indicates that dispersal, and hence stock size, is likely to be low and that, therefore, stocks are far more vulnerable to overfishing than in most fish species. An additional difficulty is that genetic studies to date indicate a remarkably high incidence of cryptic speciation in marine invertebrates, sometimes even in comparatively well studied commercially important species. Thus, although to date marine invertebrate fisheries have not received the same level of attention from geneticist as finfish fisheries, it is clear that for invertebrate fisheries genetic data are relatively far more important if a fishery is to be exploited without being endangered.

Review: the energetic value of zooplankton and nekton species of the Southern Ocean	MARINE BIOLOGY												Understanding the energy flux through food webs is important for estimating the capacity of marine ecosystems to support stocks of living resources. The energy density of species involved in trophic energy transfer has been measured in a large number of small studies, scattered over a 40-year publication record. Here, we reviewed energy density records of Southern Ocean zooplankton, nekton and several benthic taxa, including previously unpublished data. Comparing measured taxa, energy densities were highest in myctophid fishes (ranging from 17.1 to 39.3 kJ g(-1) DW), intermediate in crustaceans (7.1 to 25.3 kJ g(-1) DW), squid (16.2 to 24.0 kJ g(-1) DW) and other fish families (14.8 to 29.9 kJ g(-1) DW), and lowest in jelly fish (10.8 to 18.0 kJ g(-1) DW), polychaetes (9.2 to 14.2 kJ g(-1) DW) and chaetognaths (5.0-11.7 kJ g(-1) DW). Data reveals differences in energy density within and between species related to size, age and other life cycle parameters. Important taxa in Antarctic food webs, such as copepods, squid and small euphausiids, remain under-sampled. The variability in energy density of Electrona antarctica was likely regional rather than seasonal, although for many species with limited data it remains difficult to disentangle regional and seasonal variability. Models are provided to estimate energy density more quickly using a species' physical parameters. It will become increasingly important to close knowledge gaps to improve the ability of bioenergetic and food web models to predict changes in the capacity of Antarctic ecosystems to support marine life.

J	Arrigo, KR; Thomas, DN				Arrigo, KR; Thomas, DN			Large scale importance of sea ice biology in the Southern Ocean	ANTARCTIC SCIENCE												Despite being one of the largest biomes on earth, sea ice ecosystems have only received intensive study over the past 30 years. Sea ice is a unique habitat for assemblages of bacteria, algae, protists, and invertebrates that grow within a matrix dominated by strong gradients in temperature, salinity, nutrients, and UV and visible radiation. A suite of physiological adaptations allow these organisms to thrive in ice, where their enormous biomass makes them a fundamental component of polar ecosystems. Sea ice algae are an important energy and nutritional source for invertebrates such as juvenile krill, accounting for up to 25% of total annual primary production in ice-covered waters. The ability of ice algae to produce large amounts of UV absorbing compounds such as mycosporine-like amino acids makes them even more important to organisms like krill that can incorporate these sunscreens into their own tissues. Furthermore, the nutrient and light conditions in which sea ice algae thrive induce them to synthesize enhanced concentrations of polyunsaturated fatty acids, a vital constituent of the diet of grazing organisms, especially during winter. Finally, sea ice bacteria and algae have become the focus of biotechnology, and are being considered as proxies of possible life forms on ice-covered extraterrestrial systems. An analysis of how the balance between sea ice and pelagic production might change under a warming scenario indicates that when current levels of primary production and changes in the areas of sea ice habitats are taken into account, the expected 25% loss of sea ice over the next century would increase primary production in the Southern Ocean by approximately 10%, resulting in a slight negative feedback on climate warming.

Ice-associated (sympagic) microalgae could serve as a high-quality carbon source during winter, but their significance in the food web is so far unquantified. To better understand the importance of ice algae-produced carbon for the overwintering of Antarctic organisms, we investigated fatty acid (FA) and stable isotope compositions of 10 zooplankton species, and their potential sympagic and pelagic carbon sources. FA-specific carbon stable isotope compositions were used in stable isotope mixing models to quantify the contribution of ice algae-produced carbon ((Ice)) to the body carbon of each species. Mean (Ice) estimates ranged from 4% to 67%, with large variations between species and depending on the FA used for the modelling. Integrating the (Ice) estimates from all models, the sympagic amphipod Eusirus laticarpus was the most dependent on ice algal carbon ((Ice): 54%-67%), and the salp Salpa thompsoni showed the least dependency on ice algal carbon ((Ice): 8%-40%). Differences in (Ice) estimates between FAs associated with short-term vs. long-term lipid pools suggested an increasing importance of ice algal carbon for many species as the winter season progressed. In the abundant winter-active copepod Calanus propinquus, mean (Ice) reached more than 50% in late winter. The trophic carbon flux from ice algae into this copepod was between 3 and 5mgCm(-2)day(-1). This indicates that copepods and other ice-dependent zooplankton species transfer significant amounts of carbon from ice algae into the pelagic system, where it fuels the food web, the biological carbon pump and elemental cycling. Understanding the role of ice algae-produced carbon in these processes will be the key to predictions of the impact of future sea ice decline on Antarctic ecosystem functioning.

Biochemical composition, oxygen consumption, and ammonia excretion were quantified at selected developmental stages. The nauplius V-VI, with a lower weight than the egg, also has reduced amount of protein, lipids, carbohydrates and water. The nauplius exhibited higher weight-specific oxygen consumption and ammonia excretion rates than the egg and the protozoeal larva. From protozoea III to 3-day PL, there was a general increase in weight-specific oxygen consumption rate while ammonia excretion rate remained relatively stable with age. A lower oxygen consumption in the 9-day PL was possibly associated with the shift to a benthic mode of life. There was a general rise in oxygen consumption in all feeding stages upon food intake but ammonia excretion rates were unaffected. A lower O:N ratio under starved condition suggested the catabolism of constituent protein, which was the principal biochemical constituent of all stages. There was a general increase in ash and decrease in water, lipid and carbohydrate levels during larval and postlarval development.

D.; Plaganyi, Eva E.; Brown, Christopher; Richardson, Anthony J.; Matear, Richard			Future recovery of baleen whales is imperiled by climate change	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY												Historical harvesting pushed many whale species to the brink of extinction. Although most Southern Hemisphere populations are slowly recovering, the influence of future climate change on their recovery remains unknown. We investigate the impacts of two anthropogenic pressures-historical commercial whaling and future climate change-on populations of baleen whales (blue, fin, humpback, Antarctic minke, southern right) and their prey (krill and copepods) in the Southern Ocean. We use a climate-biological coupled "Model of Intermediate Complexity for Ecosystem Assessments" (MICE) that links krill and whale population dynamics with climate change drivers, including changes in ocean temperature, primary productivity and sea ice. Models predict negative future impacts of climate change on krill and all whale species, although the magnitude of impacts on whales differs among populations. Despite initial recovery from historical whaling, models predict concerning declines under climate change, even local extinctions by 2100, for Pacific populations of blue, fin and southern right whales, and Atlantic/Indian fin and humpback whales. Predicted declines were a consequence of reduced prey (copepods/krill) from warming and increasing interspecific competition between whale species. We model whale population recovery under an alternative scenario whereby whales adapt their migratory patterns to accommodate changing sea ice in the Antarctic and a shifting prey base. Plasticity in range size and migration was predicted to improve recovery for ice-associated blue and minke whales. Our study highlights the need for ongoing protection to help depleted whale populations recover, as well as local management to ensure the krill prey base remains viable, but this may have limited success without immediate action to reduce emissions.

However, they contain protein and omega-3 fatty acids. Isoelectric solubilization/precipitation (ISP) allows efficient recovery of fish protein isolate (FPI) that can be used in the development of nutraceutical products destined for human consumption. In the United States, market for nutraceutical food products in 2007 was estimated to be worth $27 billion. Forecasts for growth of nutraceutical food products range between 8.5 and 20% per year or about four times that of the food industry in general. With this demand for new products comes a need for product development and supporting literature. Consumers expect nutraceutical food products to have good sensory quality that is similar to the traditional foods in the market. Thus, this contribution focuses on the development of nutraceutical seafood products from ISP-recovered FPI by incorporating such ingredients as omega-3 oil, dietary fiber, and salt substitute.

J	Hader, DP; Villafane, VE; Helbling, EW				Haeder, Donat-P.; Villafane, Virginia E.; Helbling, E. Walter			Productivity of aquatic primary producers under global climate change	PHOTOCHEMICAL & PHOTOBIOLOGICAL SCIENCES												The productivity of aquatic primary producers depends on a number of biotic and abiotic factors, such as pH, CO2 concentration, temperature, nutrient availability, solar UV and PAR irradiances, mixing frequency as well as herbivore pressure and the presence of viruses, among others. The effects of these factors, within a climate change context, may be additive, synergistic or antagonistic. Since some of them, e.g. solar radiation and temperature, vary along a latitudinal gradient, this perspective about the effects of global climate change on primary producers will consider ecosystems individually, separated into polar (Arctic and Antarctic), temperate and tropical waters. As coastal waters are characterized by lower light penetration and higher DOM and nutrient concentrations, they are considered in a separate section. Freshwater systems are also governed by different conditions and therefore also treated in their own section. Overall, we show that although there are general common trends of changes in variables associated with global change (e.g. the impact of UVR on photosynthesis tends to decrease with increasing temperature and nutrient input), the responses of aquatic primary producers have great variability in the different ecosystems across latitudes. This is mainly due to direct or indirect effects associated with physico-chemical changes that occur within water bodies. Therefore we stress the need for regional predictions on the responses of primary producers to climate change as it is not warranted to extrapolate from one system to another.					Helbling, E.

Surimi seafood is not currently fortified with these nutraceutical ingredients. Alaska pollock surimi seafood was developed with salt substitute and fortified with either 6 g/100 g of fibre or 10 g/100 g of omega-3 oil (flax:algae:menhaden, 8:1:1) or fibre + omega-3 oil (6 g/100 g of fibre + 10 g/100 g of omega-3 oil). The objective was to determine effects of the dietary fortification on physicochemical properties of surimi. Fortification with either dietary fibre or omega-3 oil alone or in combination enhanced (P < 0.05) rheological and textural characteristics. The combined fortification had a synergistic effect on rheological properties. This indicates greater gelation of surimi in the presence of fibre + omega-3 oil, suggesting their interaction with surimi myofibrillar proteins. Fibre results in protein dehydration increasing protein concentration; while oil is immobilised by protein filling void spaces in the gel matrix. Differential scanning calorimetry showed that fibre and omega-3 oil did not interfere with normal denaturation of surimi proteins. Colour properties were only slightly affected (P < 0.05). Fortification of surimi with fibre and omega-3 oil resulted in a quality product that could be useful in developing surimi products with nutritional benefits. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Variability and change in the west Antarctic Peninsula marine system: Research priorities and opportunities	PROGRESS IN OCEANOGRAPHY												The west Antarctic Peninsula (WAP) region has undergone significant changes in temperature and seasonal ice dynamics since the mid-twentieth century, with strong impacts on the regional ecosystem, ocean chemistry and hydrographic properties. Changes to these long-term trends of warming and sea ice decline have been observed in the 21st century, but their consequences for ocean physics, chemistry and the ecology of the high-productivity shelf ecosystem are yet to be fully established. The WAP shelf is important for regional krill stocks and higher trophic levels, whilst the degree of variability and change in the physical environment and documented biological and biogeochemical responses make this a model system for how climate and sea ice changes might restructure highlatitude ecosystems. Although this region is arguably the best-measured and best-understood shelf region around Antarctica, significant gaps remain in spatial and temporal data capable of resolving the atmosphere-ice-ocean-ecosystem feedbacks that control the dynamics and evolution of this complex polar system. Here we summarise the current state of knowledge regarding the key mechanisms and interactions regulating the physical, biogeochemical and biological processes at work, the ways in which the shelf environment is changing, and the ecosystem response to the changes underway. We outline the overarching cross-disciplinary priorities for future research, as well as the most important discipline-specific objectives. Underpinning these priorities and objectives is the need to better define the causes, magnitude and timescales of variability and change at all levels of the system. A combination of traditional and innovative approaches will be critical to addressing these priorities and developing a co-ordinated observing system for the WAP shelf, which is required to detect and elucidate change into the future.

High latitude changes in ice dynamics and their impact on polar marine ecosystems	YEAR IN ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION BIOLOGY 2008	Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences											Polar regions have experienced significant warming in recent decades. Warming has been most pronounced across the Arctic Ocean Basin and along the Antarctic Peninsula, with significant decreases in the extent and seasonal duration of sea ice. Rapid retreat of glaciers and disintegration of ice sheets have also been documented. The rate of warming is increasing and is predicted to continue well into the current century, with continued impacts on ice dynamics. Climate-mediated changes in ice dynamics are a concern as ice serves as primary habitat for marine organisms central to the food webs of these regions. Changes in the timing and extent of sea ice impose temporal asynchronies and spatial separations between energy requirements and food availability for many higher trophic levels. These mismatches lead to decreased reproductive success, lower abundances, and changes in distribution. In addition to these direct impacts of ice loss, climate-induced changes also facilitate indirect effects through changes in hydrography, which include introduction of species from lower latitudes and altered assemblages of primary producers. Here, we review recent changes and trends in ice dynamics and the responses of marine ecosystems. Specifically, we provide examples of ice-dependent organisms and associated species from the Arctic and Antarctic to illustrate the impacts of the temporal and spatial changes in ice dynamics.

Alternatives for Efficient and Sustainable Production of Surimi: A Review	COMPREHENSIVE REVIEWS IN FOOD SCIENCE AND FOOD SAFETY												The links between fish processing and negative environmental impact need to be minimized. The over-exploitation of white fish stocks has compromised supply, the use of energy contributes to a high-carbon footprint, and the water resources required are also high. An option is to resort to the use of alternative species and fisheries by-catch, together with the maximum utilization of fish. In addition, edible proteins from a range of sources could be converted into added-value products using surimi-like processes. The surimi industry requires large amounts of freshwater and discharges wastewater with a high organic load. By exploring available options on processing technologies and management of the environmental impact, this review discusses the potential role of surimi and opportunities for sustainable fish processing.

Circulation patterns differ strikingly between the north and south. Meridional circulation in the north provides connections between the sub-Arctic and Arctic despite the presence of encircling continental landmasses, whereas annular circulation patterns in the south tend to isolate Antarctic surface waters from those in the north. These differences influence fundamental aspects of the polar ecosystems from the amount, thickness and duration of sea ice, to the types of organisms, and the ecology of zooplankton, fish, seabirds and marine mammals. Meridional flows in both the North Pacific and the North Atlantic oceans transport heat, nutrients, and plankton northward into the Chukchi Sea, the Barents Sea, and the seas off the west coast of Greenland. In the North Atlantic, the advected heat warms the waters of the southern Barents Sea and, with advected nutrients and plankton, supports immense biomasses of fish, seabirds and marine mammals. On the Pacific side of the Arctic, cold waters flowing northward across the northern Bering and Chukchi seas during winter and spring limit the ability of boreal fish species to take advantage of high seasonal production there. Southward flow of cold Arctic waters into sub-Arctic regions of the North Atlantic occurs mainly through Fram Strait with less through the Barents Sea and the Canadian Archipelago. In the Pacific, the transport of Arctic waters and plankton southward through Bering Strait is minimal. In the Southern Ocean, the Antarctic Circumpolar Current and its associated fronts are barriers to the southward dispersal of plankton and pelagic fishes from sub-Antarctic waters, with the consequent evolution of Antarctic zooplankton and fish species largely occurring in isolation from those to the north. The Antarctic Circumpolar Current also disperses biota throughout the Southern Ocean, and as a result, the biota tends to be similar within a given broad latitudinal band. South of the Southern Boundary of the ACC, there is a large-scale divergence that brings nutrient-rich water to the surface. This divergence, along with more localized upwelling regions and deep vertical convection in winter, generates elevated nutrient levels throughout the Antarctic at the end of austral winter. However, such elevated nutrient levels do not support elevated phytoplankton productivity through the entire Southern Ocean, as iron concentrations are rapidly removed to limiting levels by spring blooms in deep waters. However, coastal regions, with the upward mixing of iron, maintain greatly enhanced rates of production, especially in coastal polynyas. In these coastal areas, elevated primary production supports large biomasses of zoo plankton, fish, seabirds, and mammals. As climate warming affects these advective processes and their heat content, there will likely be major changes in the distribution and abundance of polar biota, in particular the biota dependent on sea ice.

J	Lee, RF; Hagen, W; Kattner, G				Lee, RF; Hagen, W; Kattner, G			Lipid storage in marine zooplankton	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												Zooplankton storage lipids play an important role during reproduction, food scarcity, ontogeny and diapause, as shown by studies in various oceanic regions. While triacylglycerols, the primary storage lipid of terrestrial animals, are found in almost all zooplankton species, wax esters are the dominant storage lipid in many deep-living and polar zooplankton taxa. Phospholipids and diacylglycerol ethers are the unique storage lipids used by polar euphausiids and pteropods, respectively. In zooplankton with large stores of wax esters, triacylglycerols are more rapidly turned over and used for short-term energy needs, while wax esters serve as long-term energy deposits. Zooplankton groups found in polar, westerlies, upwelling and coastal biomes are characterized by accumulation of large lipid stores. In contrast, zooplankton from the trades/tropical biomes is mainly composed of omnivorous species with only small lipid reserves. Diapausing copepods, which enter deep water after feeding on phytoplankton during spring/summer blooms or at the end of upwelling periods, are characterized by large oil sacs filled with wax esters. The thermal expansion and compressibility of wax esters may allow diapausing copepods and other deep-water zooplankton to be neutrally buoyant in cold deep waters, and they can thus avoid spending energy to remain at these depths. Lipid droplets are often noted in zooplankton ovaries, and a portion of these droplets can be transferred to developing oocytes. In addition to lipid droplets, zooplankton eggs have yolks with lipovitellin, a lipoprotein with approximately equal amounts of protein and lipid. The lipovitellin lipid is predominantly phosphatidylcholine, so during reproduction females must convert a portion of their storage lipid into this phospholipid. Developing embryos use their lipovitellin and lipid droplets for energy and materials until feeding begins. The various functions storage lipids serve during the different life history stages of zooplankton are very complex and still not fully understood and hence offer a multitude of fascinating research perspectives.
