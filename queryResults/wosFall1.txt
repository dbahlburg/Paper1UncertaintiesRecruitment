The trophic information for this species during the transition from the austral fall to the winter is important to understand its poorly known overwintering mechanisms. However, the few studies on the topic differ in their results, in terms of both spatial and temporal variables. We investigated the size dependence and monthly and regional variation in delta C-13 and delta N-15 values of adult krill in the Antarctic Peninsula, in the austral fall (April to May) and the early winter (June). We aimed to examine the trophic variations of krill occurred during this period, and the relationship between krill and their feeding environment in the Antarctic marine ecosystem. The following results were obtained: (1) no significant relationship was observed between size and the delta C-13 value of krill, but the delta N-15 value of krill presented a remarkable association with size; (2) the delta C-13 values of krill increased during the austral fall, but no remarkable variation existed at the onset of winter, and the delta N-15 values were not significant different during this period; (3) mean delta N-15 values of krill differed significantly between the Bransfield Strait and the South Shetland Islands. Our data imply that adult krill present size-, season-, and region-dependent trophic variation during the transition from austral fall to early winter in the Antarctic Peninsula.

Simulating larval Antarctic krill growth and condition factor during fall and winter in response to environmental variability	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												The first winter in the life cycle of Antarctic krill Euphausia superba is a critical period in which larval survival and recruitment to the adult population are highly sensitive to environmental conditions, yet little is known about larval physiological dynamics during this period. An individual-based model was developed to investigate patterns of larval krill growth and condition factor in response to environmental variability during fall and winter, west of the Antarctic Peninsula. Field and experimental observations from Southern Ocean Global Ocean Ecosystems Dynamics cruises in 2001 and 2002 and the Palmer Long-Term Ecological Research program were used to parameterize the model. Growth was modeled by partitioning total body carbon between length and condition factor. Total body carbon was simulated with empirical temperature-dependent rates of ingestion of phytoplankton and respiration, and ingestion of algae grown on a surface to simulate sea ice algae. Light-driven diel vertical migration modulated ingestion of phytoplankton and sea ice algae as a function of latitude, season and sea ice cover. Simulations highlighted 3 environmental processes that controlled food availability, and consequently, physiological condition of krill: the fall phytoplankton decline, sea ice advance and development of sea ice microbial communities, and the late winter increase in sea ice microbial community biomass. Fall phytoplankton dynamics were identified as a major driver of the physiological condition of larval krill throughout this critical period. The model presents a mechanism that links larval krill survival and recruitment to fall and winter variability in phytoplankton and sea ice dynamics along the western Antarctic Peninsula.																	0171-8630						2012	452						27	43		10.3354/meps09409							WOS:000303213900003

Patterns of total mercury and methylmercury bioaccumulation in Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) along the West Antarctic Peninsula	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												We examined mercury (Hg) accumulation in juvenile and adult subpopulations of Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) collected west of the Antarctic Peninsula. Samples were collected along a northern cross-shelf transect beginning near Anvers Island and farther south near the sea ice edge in the austral summers of 2011, 2013, 2014, and 2015. Regardless of geographical position, mean concentrations of total Hg and methylmercury (MeHg), the form of Hg that biomagnifies in marine food webs, were significantly higher in juvenile than adult krill in all years. In 2013, juvenile Antarctic krill collected along the coast near Anvers Island had significantly higher MeHg concentrations than krill collected farther offshore, and in 2013 and 2014, coastal juvenile krill exhibited some of the highest MeHg concentrations of all subpopulations sampled. Across all sampling years, collection in northern (sea ice-free) or southern (sea ice edge) transects did not affect MeHg concentrations of juvenile or adult krill, suggesting similar levels and routes of MeHg exposure across the latitudes sampled. Developmental stage, feeding near the coast, and annual variations in sea ice-driven primary and export production were identified as potentially important factors leading to greater MeHg accumulation in juvenile than adult krill. Krill-dependent predators feeding primarily on juveniles may thus accumulate more MeHg than consumers foraging on older krill. These results report MeHg concentrations in Antarctic krill and will be useful for predicting Hg biomagnification in higher-level consumers in this productive Antarctic ecosystem.

J	Lascara, CM; Hofmann, EE; Ross, RM; Quetin, LB				Lascara, CM; Hofmann, EE; Ross, RM; Quetin, LB			Seasonal variability in the distribution of Antarctic krill, Euphausia superba, west of the Antarctic Peninsula	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART I-OCEANOGRAPHIC RESEARCH PAPERS												A unique Antarctic data set from four multidisciplinary cruises (spring, Nov 1991; summer, Jan-Feb 1993; fall, Mar-May 1993; winter, Aug-Sept 1993) was analyzed to provide a description of seasonal variability in the distribution and abundance of Antarctic krill, Euphausia superba, west of the Antarctic Peninsula. Analyses of acoustic observations revealed distinct seasonal variations in estimates of krill abundance, the dimensional parameters used to characterize individual krill aggregations, the geographic area over which krill were acoustically detected, and the depth distribution of krill biomass. Spatially averaged estimates of krill biomass were an order of magnitude higher in spring (32 g m(-2)) and summer (95 g m(-2)) compared to fall (12 g m(-2)) and winter (8 g m(-2)). In summer, krill were detected throughout the region and most of the krill biomass was associated with aggregations of small cross-sectional area (< 2000 m(2)) and high mean biomass (> 150 g m(-3)), which were positioned in the upper 50 m of the water column. Winter observations, in contrast, were characterized by the absence of krill throughout most of the region and aggregations occurring deeper than 100 m with large cross-sectional area (>10000 m(2)) and low mean biomass (<10 g m(-3)). Two features common to all seasons were the presence of higher krill biomass (> 50 g m(-2)) at selected locations on the inner shelf and the disproportionate contribution, in terms of total krill biomass (>80%), by a small number of aggregations (<20%). The length frequency distributions of krill collected by nets showed an across-shelf pattern of larger (>40 mm) krill positioned offshore of smaller krill (32-38 mm) in all seasons except winter. Synthesis of these data and historical observations suggest that there is a seasonal shift in the primary habitat of krill and that changes in krill behavior are an important factor affecting variations in krill distributions.

J	SPIRIDONOV, VA				SPIRIDONOV, VA			SPATIAL AND TEMPORAL VARIABILITY IN REPRODUCTIVE TIMING OF ANTARCTIC KRILL (EUPHAUSIA-SUPERBA DANA)	POLAR BIOLOGY												Spawning dates of Antarctic krill, Euphausia superba Dana, were calculated from larval stage compositions, and corrected using data on maturity stage composition of the adult krill. Both original and literature data obtained from the Antarctic Peninsula-Bellingshausen Sea area and around the Antarctic continent were used. A time series (1975/76-1986/87) for several subareas of the Antarctic Peninsula-Bellingshausen Sea area indicates considerable variation in the krill spawning start, maxima and completion. In particular years (1975/76, 1980/81), krill spawning in the western Atlantic sector began relatively early, was intensive, and completed early. Some years (1977/78, 1981/82) were characterised by long and non-synchronised krill spawning. Compiled data sets for the Atlantic sector (1980/81), the entire Antarctic (1983/84) and the east Indian-west Pacific Antarctic waters (1981-85) reveal some spatial patterns in krill reproductive timing. In relation to spawning timing variation, the habitats of the krill population fall into five categories: (1) areas with an early beginning (late November- early December) and a variable, but normally long, duration (3-3.5 months) of krill spawning; this is generally the southern boundary of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current, (2) areas with an early beginning, but a short duration of krill spawning (Gerlache Strait), (3) areas with a highly variable (within 1-1.5 months) beginning and a relatively long duration (ca. 3 months) of krill spawning (Bransfield Strait, Palmer Archipelago), (4) areas with a late beginning (late December-January) and a long duration of krill spawning (Bellingshausen Sea, D'Urville Sea, and Balleny Islands area), and (5) areas with a delayed beginning, but a very short duration (ca. 1.5 months) of krill spawning (Ross Sea slope, probably the Coastal Current area off the. Lasarev Sea shelf and in the south-eastern Weddell Sea. These patterns can be partly explained by peculiarities of the ice regime in particular areas and by routes of krill movement within water circulation systems.																	0722-4060					FEB	1995	15	3					161	174									WOS:A1995QJ51000002

Modeling the remote and local connectivity of Antarctic krill populations along the western Antarctic Peninsula	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												The abundance and distribution of Antarctic krill Euphausia superba over the western Antarctic Peninsula (wAP) continental shelf suggest that these populations are maintained by inputs from upstream sources via advection of individuals that originated in the Bellingshausen Sea, in addition to local spawning and retention. The objective of our study was to evaluate these 2 mechanisms (remote and local inputs) and the consequences for wAP Antarctic krill populations. The relative effect of local versus remote connectivity was investigated using Lagrangian particle tracking experiments. Particles released in the Bellingshausen Sea were transported to the wAP shelf in 120 d, which is consistent with the time required for Antarctic krill eggs to develop into late-stage larvae. An estimated 23% of the particles released along the shelf break crossed the outer shelf and were transported to the mid and inner regions of the wAP shelf via 3 pathways that provide conduits for onshore intrusions of Circumpolar Deep Water (CDW). Of the particles that moved onto the wAP shelf, 54% were transported to inner shelf regions that are associated with areas of enhanced biological production. Of the particles at the outer shelf similar to 33% continued transport northeastward with the Antarctic Circumpolar Current. Particles released in the mid and inner shelf showed limited connectivity and low export from the shelf (<20%). The Lagrangian experiments indicate that Antarctic krill populations in the Marguerite Bay region of the wAP continental shelf are maintained by local and remote inputs of larvae. Regions influenced by intrusions of CDW are more dependent on remote inputs of Antarctic krill larvae.

Short-term grazing estimates are calculated by integrating (1) theoretical and experimental estimates of ingestion rates in response to the standing stock of phytoplankton, and (2) field measurements of phytoplankton standing stock and grazer biomass. Field data come from three austral summer cruises (January/February of 1993, 1994, and 1995) and one sequence of seasonal cruises (summer, fall and winter 1993). The relative and absolute abundance of the dominant macrozooplankton grazers, Euphausia superba and Salpa thompsoni, varied by at least an order of magnitude on the spatial and temporal scales observed. Mean grazing rates ranged from 0.4 to 9.0 mu g chlorophyll m(-2) h(-1) for the Antarctic krill and salp populations over the three summer cruises. This leads to variability in the flow of carbon from the primary producers through the grazers on the same scales. Temporal and spatial variability in grazing impact and faecal pellet production are high.																	0924-7963					NOV	1998	17	1-4					261	273		10.1016/S0924-7963(98)00042-6							WOS:000077463500018

Environmental drivers of the physiological condition of mature female Antarctic krill during the spawning season: implications for krill recruitment	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												Southern Ocean pelagic productivity relies on the abundance of Antarctic krill Euphausia superba, which fluctuates on a 5-7 yr cycle and is driven by interannual variability in recruitment. The western Antarctic Peninsula (wAP) is home to a significant proportion of the circum-Antarctic krill biomass and is the focus of the krill fishery. The wAP is warming at a rate quicker than most other places on Earth, with notable regional changes in the pelagic ecosystem. There is a major gap in our understanding of how environmental variability affects the reproductive success of krill. We used historical krill population data collected at the wAP (January 1993-2008, Palmer Antarctica Long Term Ecological Research) to assess the effects of environmental variability on the condition of mature female krill during the spawning season and its relationship with krill recruitment. Mature female krill condition during the spawning season was positively correlated with recruitment the subsequent year. Results of generalized additive models indicated that the predominant drivers of krill condition during the spawning season were climatological (Southern Annular Mode and Multivariate El Nino Southern Oscillation Index), though the timing of sea ice advance and retreat, and diatom concentrations were also important Gaining a better understanding of the oceanographic and climatological factors that affect the physiological condition of mature female krill is critical for predicting future demographic patterns and responses to change. Results from our study emphasize the importance of including the effects of climate change in the management models for the Antarctic krill fishery.																	0171-8630	1616-1599				JUL 8	2021	669						65	82		10.3354/meps13720							WOS:000672774400005

Modeling environmental controls on the transport and fate of early life stages of Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) on the western Antarctic Peninsula continental shelf	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART I-OCEANOGRAPHIC RESEARCH PAPERS												A one-dimensional, temperature-dependent model was used to simulate the descent ascent cycle of the embryos and early larval stages of Antarctic krill to determine which regions of the western Antarctic Peninsula (wAP) continental shelf support successful completion of this cycle under present environmental conditions and those projected to occur as a result of climate change. The transport and fate of the embryo and larva under present and modified conditions was investigated with Lagrangian particle tracking simulations. The two modeling studies were implemented using temperature and density (embryo larva model) and circulation distributions (Lagrangian particle tracking) obtained from a high resolution version of the Regional Ocean Modeling System configured for the wAP shelf region. Additional simulations used temperature and circulation distributions obtained from simulations that were forced with increased wind speed and increased transport of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC), both projected to possibly occur with climate change in the wAP region. Simulations using present conditions showed that successful completion of the descent ascent cycle occurred along the outer shelf and on the shelf in regions with bottom depths of 600-700 m. Estimated residence times for the shelf regions that support success of the embryo and larva were 20-30 days. Thus, krill spawned in the mid and inner shelf regions can be retained in these regions through development to the first feeding stage (calyptopis 1). Increased winds and ACC transport resulted in more onshelf transport of Circumpolar Deep Water (CDW), which increased the volume of warm (1-1.5 degrees C) water at depth. These conditions supported a moderate increase in success of the krill embryo and larva, but only for limited areas of the shelf where hatching depths decreased by 10-30 m (<5%) and development time to the calyptopis 1 stage decreased by 15-20%. The modified circulation conditions also supported increased advection of krill larvae into areas of the shelf that would experience the largest reduction of sea ice, especially in winter. Projected changes in wind strength and COW transport may potentially enhance larval survival and advection onto the wAP shelf, but recruitment may be decreased by modifications to local sea ice distributions that would impede survival of Antarctic krill that overwinter on the shelf.

A folding study of the AK from E. superba (ESAK) has not yet been reported. To gain insights into the structural and folding mechanisms of ESAK, the denaturants guanidine HCl and urea were applied in this study. We purified ESAK from the muscle of E. superba and evaluated the inhibition kinetics with structural unfolding studies under various conditions. The results revealed that ESAK was almost completely inactivated when using 1.0 M guanidine HCl and 8.25 M urea. The kinetics, characterized via time-interval measurements, showed that the inactivations by guanidine HCl and urea were first-order reactions, with the kinetic processes shifting from monophases to biphases as concentrations increased. Measurements of intrinsic and ANS (anilinonaphthalene-8-sulfonate)-binding fluorescences showed that guanidine HCl and urea induced conspicuous changes in tertiary structures and followed the regular unfolding mechanisms. Our study provides information regarding the folding of this muscle-derived metabolic enzyme and expands our knowledge and understanding of invertebrate metabolisms.																	0273-2289	1559-0291				APR	2014	172	8					3888	3901		10.1007/s12010-014-0802-9							WOS:000334433200014	24577673

Antarctic krill eggs hatch in the aphotic zone up to 1000 m depth and larvae develop on their way to the ocean surface (development ascent) and are exposed to different quality (wavelength) and quantity (irradiance) of light. Adults show a daily vertical migration pattern, moving downward during the day and upward during the night within the top 200 m of the water column. Seawater acts as a potent chromatic filter and animals have evolved different opsin photopigments to perceive photons of specific wavelengths. We have investigated the transcriptome of E. superba and, using a candidate gene approach, we identified six novel opsins. Five are r-type visual opsins: four middle-wavelength-sensitive (EsRh2, EsRh3, EsRh4 and EsRh5) and one long-wavelength sensitive (EsRh6). Moreover, we have identified a non-visual opsin, the EsPeropsin. All these newly identified opsin genes were significantly expressed in compound eyes and brain, while only EsPeropsin and EsRh2 were clearly detected also in the abdomen. A temporal modulation in the transcription of these novel opsins was found, but statistically significant oscillations were only observed in EsRrh3 and EsPeropsin. Our results contribute to the dissection of the complex photoreception system of E. superba, which enables this species to respond to the daily and seasonal changes in irradiance and spectral composition in the Southern Ocean.

J	Donachie, SP; Zdanowski, MK				Donachie, SP; Zdanowski, MK			Potential digestive function of bacteria in krill Euphausia superba stomach	AQUATIC MICROBIAL ECOLOGY												Evidence is presented that bacteria in the stomach of live Antarctic krill Euphausia superba participate in the digestion of host dietary components. Total (AODC: Acridine Orange Direct Count) and culturable (CFU: Colony Forming Units) bacteria in this organ in fresh adult krill were compared in numerical and physiological terms with those in contemporaneously collected seawater samples in Admiralty Bay, King George Island, South Shetland Islands. On a per unit volume basis, AODC and CFU numbers in the stomach were greater than in the seawater, and higher than could be accounted for through selective prey filtration alone. CFU in the stomach and seawater averaged similar to 4% and <0.01% of the respective AODC, and in the stomach similar to 6% of AODC were dividing, compared to less than 1% in seawater, observations suggesting that bacterial growth occurs in the stomach. Biovolume of cells in the stomach exceeded that of cells in seawater (t(2854) = -6.262, P < 0.001), but the former were too small to have been selectively filtered. Maltose and gluconate assimilation, and lipase (C-14), 'trypsin'-like, and acid phosphatase activities were significantly more prominent in culturable bacteria from the stomach than seawater, further indicating selection.

To this end, instantaneous growth rate experiments were conducted with larval and juvenile krill to determine growth increments and molting frequency in situ. All experiments were carried out during fall and winter months (April through September) on nine separate cruises west of the Antarctic Peninsula between 1987 and 1999. A consistent seasonal pattern across years was observed: growth rates decreased during fall (April/May), were minimal in early winter (June), and increased to maximum rates by late winter (September). Habitat-specific differences (water column vs under-ice) in growth rates of larvae collected on the same cruise were not observed in early winter (June 1993; within-year comparison). However, in a between-year comparison, larvae from the under-ice habitat (June/July 1987) had significantly higher growth increments than larvae from the open-water habitat (July 1989). The difference between these two comparisons may be a function of the degree of contrast in food availability in the water column and the sea ice at different times in the winter. Daylength at the time of collection explained 74% of the variation in larval and juvenile growth rates. This correlation may be an indirect effect of the influence of diel cycles on krill behavior and/or primary production in both the water column and ice.																	0025-3162					NOV	2003	143	5					833	843		10.1007/s00227-003-1130-8							WOS:000186463800001

Histopathology of Antarctic krill, Euphausia superba, bearing black spots	JOURNAL OF INVERTEBRATE PATHOLOGY					40th Annual Meeting of the Society-for-Invertebrate-Pathology	AUG 12-16, 2007	Quebec City, CANADA	Sov Invertebrate Pathol				Small black spots have been noticed on the cephalothorax of Antarctic krill, Euphausia superba, since January, 2001. To study the nature of the black spots, the krill were sampled in the winter of 2003, 2006, and 2007 in the South Georgia region, the Antarctic Ocean. Histological observations revealed that the black spots were melanized nodules that were composed of hemocytes surrounding either bacteria OF amorphous material. In the 2007 samples, 42% of the krill had melanized nodules. Most of the nodules had an opening on the body Surface of the krill. A single melanized nodule often contained more than one type of morphologically distinct bacterial cell. Three bacteria were isolated from these black spots, and classified into either Psychrobacter or Pseudoalteromonas based on the sequences of 16S rRNA genes. More than three bacterial species or strains were also confirmed by in situ hybridization for 16S rRNA. The melanized nodules were almost always accompanied by a mass of atypical, large heteromorphic cells, which were not observed in apparently healthy krill. Unidentified parasites were observed in some of the krill that had melanized nodules. These parasites were directly surrounded by the large heteromorphic cells. Histological observations suggested that these heteromorphic cells were attacking the parasites. These results suggest the possibility that the krill had been initially affected by parasite infections, and the parasitized spots were secondary infected by environmental bacteria after the parasites had escaped from the host body.

We investigated the effects of Zn2+ on the enzymatic activity and unfolding and aggregation of Euphausia superba arginine kinase (ESAK). Zn2+ inhibited the activity of ESAK (IC50 = 0.027 +/- 0.002 mM) following first-order kinetics consistent with the transition from a mono-phasic to a bi-phasic reaction. Double-reciprocal Lineweaver-Burk plots indicated that Zn2+ induced non-competitive inhibition of arginine and ATP. Circular dichroism spectra and spectrofluorometry results showed that Zn2+ induced secondary and tertiary structural changes in ESAK with exposure of hydrophobic surfaces and directly induced ESAK aggregation. The addition of osmolytes such as glycine and proline successfully blocked ESAK aggregation, recovering the conformation and activity of ESAK. Our study demonstrates the effect of Zn2+ on ESAK enzymatic function and folding and unfolding mechanisms, and might provide important insights into other metabolic enzymes of invertebrates in extreme climatic marine environments.

Crude protein content was 77.7% and 80.8% of the dry matter of E. superba and E. pacifica, respectively. The dominating amino acids in both krill were glutamic acid, aspartic acid, glycine, arginine, leucine and tyrosine. Crude fat content was 10.9% and 5.4% of dry matter of E. superba and E. pacifica, respectively. The main lipid class of the extracted lipids was phospholipids at 88.5% in E. superba and 96.4% in E. pacifica. The dominating fatty acids in both krill were 22:6 (n-3), 20:5 (n-3), 16:0 and 18:1 (n-9). Astaxanthin (3, 3'-dihydroxy-beta, beta-carotene-4, 4'-dione) content of E. superba and E. pacifica was 566 mg/100 g and 252 mg/100 g of dry matter, respectively. Retinol of E. superba and E. pacifica was 153.0 mg/100 g (510 000 IU/100 g) and 57.6 mg/100 g (192 000 IU/100 g) of dry matter, respectively.

In the present study, a novel thioredoxin gene was identified in antarctic microcrustacean, Euphausia superba (designated as EsTrx1). The full-length cDNA sequences of EsTrx1 was of 621 bp, containing a 5' untranslated region (UTR) of 45 bp, a 3' UTR of 276 bp and an open reading frame (ORF) of 303 bp encoding a putative protein of 100 amino acids. The predicted molecular weight of EsTrx1 was 11.08 kDa and the theoretical isoelectric point was 4.51. Multiple sequence alignment indicated that the EsTrx1 possessed conserved CGPC redox-active site. EsTrx1 shared 68.6% similarity with the Chinese mitten crab (Eriocheir sinensis) Trx1. The predicted three-dimensional structure of EsTrx1 consisted of a central core of a four-stranded beta-sheet and four flanking alpha-helices. The high similarity of EsTrx1 with Trxls from other animals together with the phylogenetic analysis indicated that EsTrx1 could be a novel member of Trx1 sub-family. In order to elucidate its biological functions, the recombinant EsTrx1 was constructed and expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3). Experiments demonstrated that the rEsTrx1 fusion protein possessed the expected redox activity in enzymatic analysis, and be more potent than GSH in antioxidant capacity. These results together indicated that EsTrx1 could be involved in the oxidative stress response of E. superba. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY												Samples were obtained with two pairs of black and white nets towed simultaneously at varying light conditions in the Weddell-Scotia confluence region. The statistical analysis (ANOVA, Regression and Kruskal-Wallis test) of the log transformed counts of Euphausia superba calyptopes larvae (CI, CII and CIII) shows that the significant difference between the white and black nets found in daytime are not present in darkness. A negative regression coefficient was detected between the difference in catches and sun's height, pointing to a light dependent avoidance reaction. These results demonstrate that the day/night differences in observed densities of krill larvae are due to net avoidance rather than to vertical migration, a result confirmed by hydroacoustical observations; and that the habitat of these stages is restricted at all times to the upper layers of the ocean.

The recruitment index (R(1)), based on the relative abundance of the 1+ age class, varies substantially between years, whereas it is quite similar between different surveys within the same field season. The overall mean recruitment index for all years was R(mean) = 0.210. Good recruitment was observed for the 1980/81, 1985/86, 1987/88, and 1990/91 year classes; exceedingly poor recruitment occurred for the 1976/77, 1982/83, 1983/84, 1988/89, 1991/92 and 1992/93 year classes. Pairwise correlations between the stock parameters, recruitment indices, and available environmental data indicate that good and poor year class success are directly and indirectly related to sea ice conditions during the preceding winter season, the timing of krill spawning, and the occurrence of dense salp concentrations. No correlation is shown with upper water column temperature or krill stock/spawning stock size. A concept is developed describing the interactions of various parameters leading to good or poor krill recruitment.																	0171-8630					JUL	1995	123	1-3					45	56		10.3354/meps123045							WOS:A1995RQ34100006

First, a specific antiserum to P. antarctica was produced and tested on phytoplankton cells and extracts. Then, the antiserum was tested on extracts of stomachs from krill fed diets of either Thalassiosira antarctica or P. antarctica, and also on mixtures of these extracts. The antiserum response was a logarithmic function of the percentage of the extract mixture that came from P. antarctica-fed krill. In the field, the antiserum was tested on krill collected during December 1996 to February 1997 in the Palmer Long-Term Ecological Research study region west of the Antarctic Peninsula. The antiserum. response suggested that krill ingested P. antarctica at 20% of the stations tested, most of them in nearshore areas. Krill grazed P. antarctica only at stations where concentrations of the marker pigment for P. antarctica, 19'-hexanoyloxyfucoxanthin, were above 0.150 mug l(-1). At these stations, the percentage of P. antarctica in the krill stomach extracts was positively correlated with chlorophyll a concentrations, but negatively correlated with the proportion of P. antarctica within the phytoplankton community. Overall, P. antarctica appeared to comprise a relatively small proportion of the phytoplankton utilized by krill, both spatially and temporally.

Despite its ecological and commercial importance, genetic population structure of the Antarctic krill remains poorly described. In an attempt to illuminate genetic markers for future population and phylogenetic analysis, five E. superba mitogenomes, from samples collected west of the Antarctic Peninsula, were sequenced using new 454 next-generation sequencing techniques. The sequences, of lengths between 13,310 and 13,326 base pairs, were then analyzed in the context of two previously-published near-complete sequences. Sequences revealed relatively well-conserved partial mitochondrial genomes which included complete sequences for 11 of 13 protein-coding genes, 16 of 23 tRNAs, and the large ribosomal subunit. Partial sequences were also recovered for cox1 and the small ribosomal subunit. Sequence analysis suggested that the cox2, nad5, and nad6 genes would be the best candidates for future population genetics analyses, due to their high number of variable sites. Future work to reveal the noncoding control region remains.

This time of the year may be a critical period in the krill life cycle because their larvae must switch from feeding on summer phytoplankton blooms to winter ice algae. FIV utilized mainly lipids overall, but also protein during the second half of the 12 d period. After 6 d of starvation most of the larvae lost half of their body C. Body lipid content decreased from 12.7 to 1.5 % of dry mass (DM), whereas protein fell from 32.7 to 25.8% of DM, Respiration rates decreased from 1.3 to 0.7-0.8 mu m O-2 (mg DM)(-1) h(-1) in the first 3 d, after which they remained roughly constant. These rates correspond to C losses of 2.7 and 2.0% body C d(-1) respectively. Excretion rates decreased from 0.04 to 0.02 mu g NH4 (mg DM)(-1) h(-1) until the middle of the starvation period and then rose to 0.05 mu g NH4 (mg DM)(-1) h(-1) by the end, which is probably related to the increase in protein breakdown. Based on these losses of body C and lipid, the FIV larvae may pass their point of no return, where they lose their ability to recover from nutritional stress, after 6 d.

The measurement of temporal increases in quantities of fluorescent age-pigments has been suggested as a method which obviates the problems associated with size-related measures of age. In this study, a laboratory population of Antarctic krill exhibited a clear increase in the mean amount of fluorescent age-pigment per animal over a period of 1 yr. At the same time the mean weight of the animalsin the population decreased markedly-body shrinkage. Analyses of fluorescence- and weight-frequency plots from samples taken a year apart demonstrated that the fluorescence technique could successfully discriminate the two year groups and determine their correct temporal sequence whereas the weight frequency analysis was less successful at discriminating the two peaks and placed them in an incorrect temporal sequence. On the basis of these results it is suggested that age-pigment fluorescence may now be a useful tool in the analysis of age-structure in populations of Antarctic krill.																	0022-0981						1991	146	2					153	161		10.1016/0022-0981(91)90022-O							WOS:A1991FJ85900002

A dense phytoplankton bloom (5 to 25 mug chl a l(-1)) occupied the mixed layer throughout the study period. The feeding of larvae was measured by incubating the animals in natural seawater. Food concentrations ranged from 102 to 518 mug C l(-1) across experiments, and the mean daily C rations were 28% body C for calyptosis stage Ill (CIII), 25% for furcilia stage I (FI) and 15% for FII. The phytoplankton, dominated by diatoms and motile prey taxa, ranged from 8 to 79 pm in size. Across this size spectrum of diatoms, CIII cleared small cells most efficiently, as did FI to a lesser degree. FII, however, showed no clear tendency for a specific cell size. Across the measured size spectrum of the motile taxa, all larvae stages showed a clear preference towards the larger cells. Estimated C assimilation efficiencies were high, from 70 to 92% (mean 84%). Respiration rates of freshly caught larvae were 0.7 to 1.1 mul O-2 mg DM-1 h(-1). The calculated respiratory C loss showed a significant increase with increasing food concentration in all larval stages, ranging from 0.9 to 2.4% body C d(-1). These respiratory losses, combined with the high assimilation efficiencies, thus give the larvae ample capacity for growth at these food concentrations. Critical concentrations of food to achieve maximum daily rations were in the range of 100 to 200 mug C l(-1) (similar to2 to 4 mug chl a l(-1)). Thus productive shelf sites along the Antarctic Peninsula, such as Rothera, may act as good 'nursery' areas for krill larvae.

Interannual spatial variability of krill (Euphausia superba) influences seabird foraging behavior near Elephant Island, Antarctica	FISHERIES OCEANOGRAPHY												We investigate the influence of krill (principally Euphausia superba) patchiness on the foraging distributions of seabirds to understand how variation in krill influences patch dynamics between krill and birds. At sea-surveys were conducted near Elephant Island, Antarctica, for 3 yr (2004-2006) during the annual U.S. Antarctic Marine Living Resources (AMLR) program. Standardized strip-transect surveys were used to map seabirds, and a combination of acoustic and net surveys was used to map krill. We measured patch size of krill and seabirds and elucidated how krill patch dynamics influence foraging seabirds. The spatial association between krill and predators was influenced by the size and arrangement of krill patches. We found a negative relationship between abundance and patchiness of krill and predators, indicating that when krill is less abundant, its predators are less abundant and concentrated. We conclude that annual patch dynamics of krill strongly influences the local abundance and distribution of seabirds. Such information should be used to interpret potential interactions between seabirds and krill fisheries operating near Elephant Island.																	1054-6006	1365-2419					2009	18	1					20	35		10.1111/j.1365-2419.2008.00490.x							WOS:000262887400002

In this study, three dominant krill species, Euphausia superba, Thysanoessa macrura and Euphausia crystallorophias, were collected from Prydz Bay, Antarctica, during austral summer of 2009/2010. The composition of fatty acids in these species was studied. E. superba and T. macrura showed a similar fatty acid composition which was dominated by C14:0, C16:0, EPA (eicosapentenoic acid) and DHA (de-cosahexenoic acid) while E. crystallorophias showed higher contents of C18:1(n-9), C18:1(n-7), DHA and EPA than the former two. Higher fatty acid ratios of C18:1(n-9)/18:1(n-7), PUFA (polyunsaturated fatty acid)/SFA (saturated fatty acid), and 18PUFA/16PUFA indicated that E. crystallorophias should be classified as a typical omnivore with a higher trophic position compared with E. superba and T. macrura.																	1672-5182	1993-5021				APR	2016	15	2					297	302		10.1007/s11802-016-2791-5							WOS:000376023500013

Sex ratios of krill vary remarkably between swarms and this phenomenon is poorly understood, as identification of krill sex relies on external morphological differences that appear late during development. Sex determination mechanisms in krill are unknown, but could include genetic, environmental or parasitic mechanisms. Similarly, virtually nothing is known about molecular sex differentiation. The krill genome has to date not been sequenced, and due to its enormous size and large amount of repetitive elements, it is currently not feasible to develop sex-specific DNA markers. To produce a reliable molecular marker for sex in krill and to investigate molecular sex differentiation we therefore focused on identifying sex-specific transcriptomic differences. Through transcriptomic analysis, we found large gene expression differences between testes and ovaries and identified three genes exclusively expressed in female whole krill from early juvenile stages onwards. The sex-specific expression of these three genes persisted through sexual regression, although our regressed samples originated from a krill aquarium and may differ from wild-regressed krill. Two slightly male-biased genes did not display sufficient expression differences to clearly differentiate sexes. Based on the expression of the three female-specific genes we developed a molecular test that for the first time allows the unambiguous sex determination of krill samples lacking external sex-specific features from juvenile stages onwards, including the sexually regressed krill we examined.

J	Haberman, KL; Ross, RM; Quetin, LB				Haberman, KL; Ross, RM; Quetin, LB			Diet of the Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba Dana): II. Selective grazing in mixed phytoplankton assemblages	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY												Diatoms, prymnesiophytes, and cryptophytes are the major taxonomic classes of phytoplankton available to Antarctic krill as primary food resources. However, the relative contribution of each class to the diet of krill is unknown. In this study, selectivity for different phytoplankton taxa by Euphausia superba was examined during laboratory experiments with E. superba grazing on mixed phytoplankton assemblages from the wild and from laboratory cultures. Clearance rates and changes in relative concentrations of diatoms, prymnesiophytes and cryptophytes were measured by analysis of taxon-specific accessory photopigments with high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). E. superba grazed diatoms at higher rates than Phaeocystis and cryptophytes. Grazing was negligible in cryptophyte-dominated assemblages, Increases of up to 369% in 19'-hexanoyloxyfucoxanthin (HF)/fucoxanthin (FUCO) (prymnesiophyte/diatom) ratios indicated a high level of selectivity for diatoms over Phaeocystis. This selectivity occurred even for Phaeocystis colonies of similar size to diatoms, and thus cannot be entirely attributed to differential sieving efficiency based on particle size. The results suggest that krill actively select diatoms in phytoplankton mixtures.

Adults, eggs, nauplii, metanauplii, calyptopis I-III, and furcilia I-II were found in the investigation. The abundance of larvae averaged 1 172.8 ind./m(2), with calyptopis I and II as the dominant stages. Habitat occupancy patterns varied among Euphausia superba at different stages, and three sub-regionswere identified by cluster analysis. The degree of larval development increased fromwest to east. Larvae were not observed north of the South Shetland Islands. Calyptopis I was predominant in the water between Elephant Island and the South Orkney Islands, which featured no thermocline. Older stages, including calyptopis II and III and furcilia I and II, were common in north and northeast of the South Orkney Islands, which were characterized by high temperature and high chlorophyll concentration. Distribution and abundance of the early life stages of E. superba were associated with specific environmental conditions. According to Biota-Environment matching (BIOENV), the distributions of E. superba larvae were correlated with a combination of temperature at the surface and 200m, and 0-100 mintegrated chlorophyll a concentration.																	0253-505X	1869-1099				NOV	2013	32	11					59	67		10.1007/s13131-013-0378-1							WOS:000327079700008

Individual fresh mass varied from 0.16 to 1.72 g [median values of 0.47 g (0.16 to 0.94), 1.14 g (0.71 to 1.63) and 1.46 g (0.94 to 1.72) for immatures, males and females respectively]. Lipid amounts varied from 5 to 147 mg ind.(-1) [median values of 17.8 mg (5.1 to 64.2), 21.0 mg (9.3 to 87.7) and 70.3 mg (17.3 to 146.9) for immatures, males and females respectively]. Triacylglycerol (TAG) and phosphatidylcholine were the 2 most abundant lipid classes in all krill. Multivariate analysis of lipid composition indicated significant overlap between sex-maturity classes, although female krill tended to be distinguished from males by higher proportions of TAG and lower proportions of phosphatidylserine plus phosphatidylinositol. Reproductive investment is implicated in the overall variability in Lipid content and composition, with females containing high lipid levels as reserves for egg production, whilst males showed apparent Lipid deficits resulting from short-term mobilisation of storage material for spermatophore production and attachment. Significant and systematic site-to-site variability in Lipid content and composition were evident in the samples and this could not be explained by the sex ratio or krill size.																	0171-8630					FEB	1995	117	1-3					49	57		10.3354/meps117049							WOS:A1995QJ84800005

Despite substantial research on this species, there is no comprehensive understanding of the population genetics of E. superba yet. In this study, the ND6 gene was used to assess the genetic variation in E. superba. In the South Shetland Islands, the population of E. superba shows abundant genetic variation, but we found a lack of genetic structure. An analysis of the demographic history suggested that a sudden expansion has been responsible for its high biomass. Our study could not only broaden our comprehension of E. superba, but also provide more scientific information on fisheries resources exploitation, biodiversity conservation and the maintenance of a proper ecological balance.																	0011-216X	1568-5403				DEC	2019	92	11-12					1295	1309		10.1163/15685403-00003950							WOS:000503831700003

In the context of predicted global warming, it is particularly important to understand how classic biomarkers of heat stress function in this species. In this respect, Hsp70s are acknowledged as good candidates. However, previous studies of expression kinetics have not been able to demonstrate significant upregulation of these genes in response to heat shocks at 3 degrees C and 6 degrees C for 3 and 6 h. The current work complements these previous results and broadens the prospects for the use of Hsp70s as a relevant marker of thermal shock in this krill species. New experiments demonstrate that induction of Hsp70 isoforms was not detected during exposure to heat shock, but increased expression was observed after several hours of recovery. To complete the analysis of the expression kinetics of the different isoforms, experiments were carried out over short time scales (1 and 2 h at 3 degrees C and 6 degrees C) as well as at higher temperatures (9 degrees C, 12 degrees C, and 15 degrees C for 3 h), without any significant response. A 6-week monitoring of animals at 3 degrees C showed that the time factor is decisive in the establishment of the response. CTmax experiments with incremental times of 1 degrees C per day or 1 degrees C every 3 days have shown a particularly high resilience of the animals. The demonstration of the abundance of Hsp70s present before thermal stress in various species of krill, as well as in specimens of E. superba of various origins, showed that the delay in the response in expression could be related to the high constitutive levels of Hsp70 available before the stress experiments. The alternative labelling of the two main isoforms of Hsp70 according to the origin of the animals allowed hypotheses to be put forward on the functioning of thermoregulation in Antarctic krill as well as ice krill.

We investigated the effects of Cu2+ on the enzymatic activity, unfolding and aggregation of Euphausia superba arginine kinase (ESAK). Cu2+ inhibited the activity of ESAK (IC50 = 0.050 +/- 0.002 mM) following first-order kinetics consistent with the transition from a monophasic to a biphasic reaction. Double-reciprocal Lineweaver-Burk plots indicated that Cu2+ induced non-competitive inhibition of arginine and ATP. Spectrofluorimetry results showed that Cu2+ induced tertiary structural changes in ESAK with exposure of hydrophobic surfaces and directly induced ESAK aggregation. The addition of osmolytes such as glycine and praline successfully blocked ESAK aggregation, recovering the conformation and activity of ESAK. Computational simulations indicated that the ATP/ADP binding site locations overlap with the Cu2+ interacting residues, inferring that Cu2+ binding can block ESAK enzyme catalysis with ATP/ADP cofactor binding via modulating structural conformation. Our study demonstrates the effect of Cu2+ on ESAK enzymatic function and folding mechanisms that might provide important insights into other metabolic enzymes of invertebrates in extreme climatic marine environments.

J	Jager, T; Ravagnan, E				Jager, Tjalling; Ravagnan, Elisa			Parameterising a generic model for the dynamic energy budget of Antarctic krill Euphausia superba	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												Dynamic Energy Budget (DEB) theory is a generic and comprehensive framework for understanding bioenergetics over the entire life cycle of an organism. Here, we apply a simplified model derived from this theory (DEBkiss) to Antarctic krill Euphausia superba. The model was parameterised using growth curves, and conversion factors for body composition and length-weight relationships. Subsequently, the model was used to predict a series of life-history traits (as function of body size) that were not used for parameterisation: instantaneous growth rates, ingestion and respiration rates, weight loss on starvation, and the number of eggs produced at spawning. Within the DEB framework, these traits are not intrinsic properties of the organism, but tightly coupled model outputs that depend on body size, life stage, and environmental conditions. Overall, the model predictions are consistent with the patterns in the (rather uncertain) observations, lending credence to the model assumptions underlying the DEBkiss model. More work is needed to fully elucidate the bioenergetics of the E. superba life cycle, but this analysis demonstrates how a dynamic budgeting framework can ensure consistency among the different life-history traits. Thereby, such models help in the interpretation of experimental results and the comparison of species, but can also form the basis for predicting population dynamics and the impacts of stressors.

Due to its central position in the food web, Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) is a key species of the marine Antarctic ecosystem. It is therefore crucial to understand how increasing water temperatures affect important krill life-cycle processes. Here, a long-term (August - March) laboratory acclimation experiment at different temperature scenarios (0.5 degrees C, 1.5 degrees C, 2.5 degrees C, 3.5 degrees C, 5 degrees C, 7 degrees C) was performed and the effects of elevated temperatures on whole animal parameters (O2 consumption, body length, length of the digestive gland) were analyzed. The response of krill oxygen consumption to different experimental temperatures differed between acute/short-term and long-term acclimation. After 8 months, krill oxygen consumption remained unchanged up to temperatures of 3.5 degrees C and was significantly higher at temperatures > 3.5 degrees C. Krill acclimated to temperatures > 3.5 degrees C were significantly smaller at the end of the experiment. Limited food intake and/or conversion may have contributed to this effect, especially pronounced after the onset of the reproductive period. In addition, the seasonal growth pattern in males differed from that of females. Together, our findings indicate that warming Southern Ocean waters are likely to increase metabolic rate in krill, possibly altering the amount of energy available for other important life-cycle processes, a finding directly related to future population dynamics and fisheries management.

Research on this species is of great value for exploitation of Antarctic biotic resources. In this study, the metabolomics of E. superba were investigated using the GC-MS method. A total of 293 compounds were initially identified; these compounds could be divided into several classes, including amino acids, sugars and polyols, metabolic intermediates, small molecules and other metabolites. However, a serious problem was that both 2-hydroxybiphenyl and dioctyl phthalate were also detected in these krill tissues. Moreover, some intermediates of pesticides and medicinal or chemical compound products were found in krill tissue as well. This is the first survey to investigate the occurrence of chemical contamination in metabolites of Antarctic krill. These findings suggest that international contracts or policies should be developed to protect the pristine ocean.																	0011-216X	1568-5403					2018	91	8					961	999		10.1163/15685403-00003801							WOS:000435492500004						
J	Atkinson, A; Snyder, R				Atkinson, A; Snyder, R			Krill-copepod interactions at South Georgia, Antarctica, I. Omnivory by Euphausia superba	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												Feeding by juvenile Antarctic krill Euphausia superba near South Georgia was assessed during the austral summer of 1995/1996. Gut fluorescence results were compared with those from incubations in natural seawater and seawater enriched with phytoplankton and zooplankton. In natural seawater, with typically low food concentrations (median 56 mg C m(-3)) the median ration was 0.68 % of krill carbon d(-1). Phytoplankton dominated carbon in the natural incubation water but dinoflagellates, ciliates and small calanoid copepods dominated the carbon intake of krill. In both natural and enriched water, maximum clearance rates were on 1 to 3 mm calanoid copepods. Copepods larger than this (e.g. late copepodite stages of Calanoides acutus and Rhincalanus gigas) were cleared more slowly despite dominating the carbon in the enriched incubations. Oithona spp. were cleared more slowly than calanoids of similar size, despite their greater abundance and their similar contributions to available carbon. These trends could reflect detection/escape interactions between krill and copepods. With enriched food, copepods dominated krill diet, krill rations exceeded 10 % of body carbon d(-1) and rations did not appear to reach a plateau even at food concentrations of similar to 1 g C m(-3). This suggests that krill could feed rapidly during periodic encounters with layers or patches of zooplankton. Gut fluorescence revealed gut passage times of 3.7 to 6.3 h and an algal carbon ration of 0.43 % d(-1), thus supporting the low algal carbon rations derived from the incubations. Published acoustic values of mean krill biomass north of South Georgia that summer of 8.3 g dry mass m(-2) were combined with their clearance rates to give estimates of krill removing daily 0.2% of phytoplankton standing stocks, 0.6% of protozoans and 1.6% of small calanoid copepods. This impact on copepods is much higher than previous estimates from Antarctic amphipods and chaetognaths. The long generation times of Antarctic copepods mean that krill were potentially important predators of small copepods during our study.																	0171-8630						1997	160						63	76		10.3354/meps160063							WOS:000071722800007

To investigate the feeding strategies of E. superba from the eastern South Shetland Islands, fatty acid biomarkers, stable isotope signatures, and an incubation experiment were conducted. The results of the incubation experiment proved that adult E. superba mainly fed on 2-20 mu m particles, demonstrating the importance of nanoplankton in their diet. Moreover, significant positive relationships between delta N-15 and body size demonstrated that size-related dietary shifts were present in E. superba. Evidence from principal component analysis and the C16:1 omega 7/C18:4 omega 3 ratio showed that juveniles preferentially fed on dinoflagellates and adults were more likely to feed on diatoms. Fatty acid profiles in adult E. superba roughly mirrored the different trophic conditions and feeding strategies between stations. Adult E. superba at Stas D2-07, D5-07, DA-01 and DA-02 exhibited elevated levels of C16:1 omega 7, C18:4 omega 3, C18:1 omega 9 and C18:1 omega 9/C18:1 omega 7, indicating higher levels of feeding on both phytoplankton and higher trophic diets. In contrast, adult E. superba at Stas D1-03 and D1-04 were characterized by high levels of polyunsaturated fatty acids/saturated fatty acids ratios and low levels of C16:1 omega 7, C18:1 omega 7, C18:4 omega 3, C18:1 omega 9 and total fatty acids. We inferred that adult krill at Stas D1-03 and D1-04 still suffered from difficult dietary conditions after overwintering. The different dietary conditions between stations suggest a highly plastic feeding strategy of E. superba in the eastern South Shetland Islands.																	0253-505X	1869-1099				OCT	2019	38	10					75	83		10.1007/s13131-019-1392-8							WOS:000490598500009

Feeding by Antarctic krill Euphausia superba in the West Antarctic Peninsula: differences between fjords and open waters	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												Antarctic krill Euphausia superba are key components of Antarctic ecosystems, serving as the major prey item for most of the megafauna in the region. Coastal fjords along the West Antarctic Peninsula have been identified as biological hotspots, areas in which high biomasses of both E. superba and their megafauna predators are consistently observed. We investigated feeding by E. superba in fjords and adjacent open waters of the West Antarctic Peninsula. Next generation sequencing of stomach contents from 174 krill indicated a diverse diet, with broad patterns consistent with previous understanding of E. superba feeding. Diatom sequence reads were frequent and abundant, indicating a largely diatom-based diet, while the occasional presence of high abundances of copepod sequence reads suggests carnivory supplemented the diet. Striking differences were observed between the stomach contents of krill collected in fjords and those of krill collected in adjacent open waters. Chaetoceros spp. diatoms made up 71 % of the stomach contents sequences of krill collected in fjords, but less than 10% of the stomach contents sequences of krill collected in open waters. These differences could not be explained by differences in the surface water phytoplankton communities, as in both open waters and fjords Chaetoceros spp. made up less than 10% of the surface water sequence read assemblages. These feeding differences highlight the importance of taking into account regional differences in krill feeding when considering E. superba's roles in Southern Ocean ecosystems, and suggest krill in fjords may make use of vertical structure in phytoplankton assemblages.																	0171-8630	1616-1599				MAY 14	2018	595						39	54		10.3354/meps12568							WOS:000432551900004

Molecular approach (PCR-DGGE) to diet analysis in young Antarctic krill Euphausia superba	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												Antarctic krill Euphausia superba Dana comprise a key component of the Southern Ocean food web, yet despite decades of research, questions concerning the regional, seasonal and ontogenetic differences in their diet remain. All current methods used to characterize krill diet have limitations for identifying the full complement of the diet. Using DNA as a marker molecule, our goal in this study has been to evaluate the efficacy of a PCR-DGGE (denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis) approach targeting the 18S rDNA gene to discriminate among diet constituents in gut and fecal pellet samples from young Antarctic krill relative to their feeding environment-the seawater and sea ice microbial community. We conducted 2 laboratory-based feeding experiments with known food items and 3 field samplings of both the krill and their feeding environment. Sequenced PCR-DGGE phylotypes from laboratory trials clearly distinguished diatom and copepod prey, while in situ feeding analyses revealed that a broad diversity of taxa were ingested, including diatoms (Bacillariophyta, the most prevalent group detected), dinoflagellates, cryptomonads, prasinophytes, ciliates, cercozoans, choanoflagellates, turbellarians and (possibly) sponge larvae. Band image analyses allowed environmental and diet phylotypes to be matched. On average, 32% of those from the environment were present in the diet; conversely, of the phylotypes detected in the diet, an average of 59% were in common with the environment. Changes in environmental phylotypes among sampling dates were reflected by similar changes in the krill diet as potential prey diversity (richness) decreased during a phytoplankton bloom.																	0171-8630						2006	319						155	165		10.3354/meps319155							WOS:000241102600014

Its trypsin, as a main substance in the metabolic reactions, plays a key role in the adaption to low temperatures. However, the progress of research on its cold-adaption mechanism is being influenced due to the limited information on its gene and spatial structure. RESULTSWe studied the gene of E. superba trypsin with transcriptome sequencing first, and then discussed its cold-adaption mechanism with the full gene and predicted structure basing on bioinformatics. The results showed the proportion of certain residues played important roles in the cold-adaptation behavior for trypsin. Furthermore, a higher proportion of random coils and reduced steric hindrance might also be key factors promoting its cold adaption. CONCLUSIONThis research aimed to reveal the cold-adaption mechanism of E. superba trypsin and provide support for basic research on molecular modification by site-directed mutagenesis of complementary DNA used to produce new and improved recombinant variants with cold adaption. Furthermore, it may broaden its commercial application on minimizing undesirable changes elevated at higher temperature in food processing and in treatment of trauma and inflammation in medicine.

Objective: Biochemical distinctions, regulation of the catalytic function, and the key residues of EFP were investigated. Methods: The serial inhibition kinetic evaluations coupled with measurements of fluorescence spectra in the presence of 4-(2-aminoethyl) benzene sulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride (AEBSF) was conducted. The computational molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were also applied for a comparative study. Results: The enzyme behaved as a monomeric protein with a molecular mass of about 28.6 kD with K-m(BApNA) = 0.629 +/- 0.02 mM and k(cat)/K-m(BApNA) = 7.08 s(-1)/mM. The real-time interval measurements revealed that the inactivation was a first-order reaction, with the kinetic processes shifting from a monophase to a biphase. Measurements of fluorescence spectra showed that serine residue modification by AEBSF directly caused conspicuous changes of the tertiary structures and exposed hydrophobic surfaces. Some osmolytes were applied to find protective roles. These results confirmed that the active region of EFP is more flexible than the overall enzyme molecule and serine, as the key residue, is associated with the regional unfolding of EFP in addition to its catalytic role. The MD simulations were supportive to the kinetics data. Conclusion: Our study indicated that EFP has an essential serine residue for its catalyst function and associated folding behaviors. Also, the functional role of osmolytes such as proline and glycine that may play a role in defense mechanisms from environmental adaptation in a krill's body was suggested.																	0929-8665	1875-5305					2021	28	6					651	664		10.2174/0929866527666201112123714							WOS:000691406900005	33183186

The proteins were solubilized two times; a water/krill ratio (mL/g) of 6 and a time of 30 min were used for the first step, whereas the second used a water/krill residue ratio (mL/g) of 3 and a time of 30 min. The optimum pH for protein precipitation was 4.6. A LFP with fluoride content of 9.86 mg/kg (dry weight) was finally obtained through a fluoride removal program. The protein yield of LFP was 52.68%. Composition analysis of LFP indicated it was composed of 66.96% of crude proteins (dry weight) and 33.01% of total lipids (dry weight)(n) and all nine essential amino acids were in sufficient amounts to meet FAO/WHO/UNU requirements for adults and infants. In addition, LFP could be taken as a good source of EPA and DHA for consideration of use as a food item for human consumption.				yuming, wang/K-8179-2012													0021-8561	1520-5118				JUN 8	2011	59	11					6108	6112		10.1021/jf201009t							WOS:000291074700040	21539395

Comparisons of grazing on Phaeocystis antarctica (Karsten) and Thalassiosira antarctica (Comber)	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY												Diatoms and prymnesiophytes are major constituents of spring phytoplankton blooms in the Antarctic. While diatoms are known to be well grazed by krill, the role of prymnesiophytes in the krill's diet is unknown. Clearance and ingestion rates of Euphausia superba grazing on three size classes of Phaeocystis antarctica were compared to rates on the diatom Thalassiosira antarctica in parallel, unialgal experiments. Clearance rates were calculated from disappearance of chlorophyll a during grazing, and converted to carbon and nitrogen ingestion rates based on elemental (CHN) analysis of phytoplankton cultures, Clearance and ingestion rates of krill on small R antaretica colonies (50-100 mum) were similar to rates on T. antarctica, whereas rates on medium P. antaretica colonies (100-500 mum) and single cell P. antarctica were significantly lower than for T antarctica. Overall, clearance rates on P antarctica decreased with increasing colony size. Clearance rates on T antarctica were variable, and correlated with degree of chain fort-nation. These results suggest that E. superba effectively grazes small colonies of P. antarctica, but not larger colonies or single cells.

Hence, the thermal and saline tolerance of krill were examined under in-situ aquarium conditions with different controlled scenarios. According to the experiments, the critical lethal times of krill were 24 h, 2 h and 0.5 h under 9 degrees C, 12 degrees C, and 15 degrees C, respectively, and the estimated 50% lethal times were about 17.1 h and 1.7 h under 12 degrees C and 15 degrees C, respectively. Additionally, the critical lethal times (the estimated 50% lethal times) of krill were approximately 14 h and 0.5 h (about 22.9 h and 1.7 h) of salinity under 19.7 and 15.9, respectively. The observed critical and 50% lethal times of krill were 0.5 h and approximately 1.4 h, respectively, salinity under 55.2. The critical and 50% lethal temperatures of krill were 13 degrees C and approximately 14.2 degrees C, respectively. Additionally, the critical and 50% lethal salinity was 19.6 and approximately 17.5 for the lower saline (below normal oceanic salinity [34.4]) environment and 50.3 and approximately 53.2 for the higher saline (above 34.4) environment, respectively. The upper thermal and saline preferences of krill can be considered 6 degrees C and 26.8 to 41.2, respectively. These results can provide potential scenarios for predicting the possible fate of this key species in the Southern Ocean.

J	Fach, BA; Hofmann, EE; Murphy, EJ				Fach, BA; Hofmann, EE; Murphy, EJ			Modeling studies of antarctic krill Euphausia superba survival during transport across the Scotia Sea	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												Antarctic krill Euphausia superba spawned on the outer continental shelf of the west Antarctic Peninsula can be entrained into the Southern Front of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current and transported across the Scotia Sea to South Georgia. A time-dependent, size-structured, physiologically based krill growth model was used to assess the food resources that are needed to sustain Antarctic krill during transport across the Scotia Sea and to allow them to grow to a size observed at South Georgia. Initial Lagrangian simulations provide trajectories that are followed by particles released on the west Antarctic Peninsula shelf. Pelagic phytoplankton concentrations along these trajectories are extracted from historical Coastal Zone Color Scanner measurements from the Antarctic Peninsula-Scotia Sea region and are input to the growth model. The results of these simulations show that pelagic phytoplankton concentrations are not sufficient to support continuous growth of Antarctic krill during the 140 to 160 d needed for transport to South Georgia. The inclusion of a supplemental food source during part of the transport time, such as sea ice algae (up to 80 mg chl a m(-3)), does not significantly alter this result. Survival and growth of larval krill during modeled transport is, however, enhanced by encounters with mesoscale patches of high chlorophyll concentrations (1 mg m(-3)), while subadults and adults benefit less from these conditions. Further simulations show the importance of an additional food source, such as heterotrophic food, for the survival of subadult and adult Antarctic krill. For all planktonic food scenarios tested, krill that begin transport at the Antarctic Peninsula did not reach the smallest age group often observed at South Georgia, the 2+ group, during the 140 to 160 d of transport. Including the effect of increasing temperature across the Scotia Sea on krill growth rate does not significantly alter these results, since the maximum increase in growth due to increased temperature obtained in the simulations was 1.0 mm for both 2 and 22 mm Antarcic krill. These simulations suggest the possibility of alternative transport scenarios, such as Antarctic krill beginning transport at the Antarctic Peninsula in austral summer and overwintering under the sea ice that extends northward from the Weddell Sea into the Scotia Sea. Such an interrupted transport would allow the Antarctic krill to overwinter in a potentially better food environment and begin transport again the following year, growing to a size that is within the range observed for Antarctic krill populations at South Georgia.

J	Zhou, M; Dorland, RD				Zhou, M; Dorland, RD			Aggregation and vertical migration behavior of Euphausia superba	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY												Aggregation and vertical migration behavior of Euphausia superba were studied in Marguerite Bay and its vicinity west of the Antarctic Peninsula using a vessel-mounted, Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler, and a Multiple Opening and Closing Nets and Environmental Sensing System, during the 2001 and 2002 fall US Southern Ocean GLOBEC project cruises. The kinematics of aggregation behavior of E. superba associated with diel migration is studied using observations of their abundance and swimming velocities: during the day, E. superba reduce their swimming at a depth of 250 m; and at night, they swim randomly at their cruising speed in the upper part of an aggregation near the surface, and coherently as schooling in the lower part of an aggregation. The causes for the aggregation behavior and vertical migration of krill are explored by examining the relationship with ice coverage and presence of predators. The motion of euphausiids is further analyzed in terms of kinetic energy and force balance, leading to new considerations of mathematical theories and models of aggregation behavior. The results show a diel variation of the energy demand for maintaining their locomotion. The horizontal scale of an aggregation is studied in conjunction with horizontal gradients of currents. Results indicate that the swimming capability of euphausiids determines the maintenance of an aggregation in the mesoscale circulation field. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

Using ultrafiltration and chromatography methods, fifteen antioxidant peptides were purified from EPAH and identified as Asn-Gln-Met (NQM), Trp-Phe-Pro-Met (WFPM), Gln-Asn-Pro-Thr (QNPT), Tyr-Met-Asn-Phe (YMNF), Ser-Gly-Pro-Ala (SGPA), Ser-Leu-Pro-Tyr (SLPY), Gln-Tyr-Pro-Pro-Met-Gln-Tyr (QYPPMQY), Glu-Tyr-Glu-Ala (EYEA), Asn-Trp-Asp-Asp-Met-Arg-Ile-Val-Ala-Val (NWDDMRIVAV), Trp-Asp-Asp-Met-Glu-Arg-Leu-Val-Met-Ile (WDDMERLVMI), Asn-Trp-Asp-Asp-Met-Glu-Pro-Ser-Phe (NWD-DMEPSF), Asn-Gly-Pro-Asp-Pro-Arg-Pro-Ser-Gln-Gln (NGPDPRPSQQ), Ala-Phe-Leu-Trp-Asn (AFLWA), Asn-Val-Pro-Asp-Met (NVPDM), and Thr-Phe-Pro-Ile-Tyr-Asp-Tyr-Pro-Gln (TFPIYDPQ), respectively, using a protein sequencer and ESI/MS. Among fifteen antioxidant peptides, SLPY, QYPPMQY and EYEA showed the highest scavenging activities on DPPH center dot (EC50 values of 1.18 +/- 0.036, 1.547 +/- 0.150, and 1.372 +/- 0.274 mg/mL, respectively), HO center dot (EC50 values of 0.826 +/- 0.027, 1.022 +/- 0.058, and 0.946 +/- 0.011 mg/mL, respectively), and superoxide anion radical (EC50 values of 0.789 +/- 0.079, 0.913 +/- 0.007, and 0.793 +/- 0.056 mg/mL, respectively). Moreover, SLPY, QYPPMQY and EYEA showed strong reducing power, protective capability against H2O2-damaged plasmid DNA, and lipid peroxidation inhibition ability. Furthermore, SLPY, QYPPMQY, and EYEA had high stability under temperatures lower than 80 degrees C, pH values ranged from 6-8, and simulated GI digestion for 180 min. The results showed that fifteen antioxidant peptides from alcalase hydrolysate of Antarctic krill proteins, especially SLPY, QYPPMQY and EYEA, might serve as effective antioxidant agents applied in food and health products.																		1660-3397				JUN	2021	19	6							347	10.3390/md19060347							WOS:000666752800001	34204535

To understand the flexibility of Antarctic krill's seasonal cycle, we investigated its physiological and behavioural responses to different light regimes and if an endogenous timing system was involved in the regulation of these seasonal processes. We analysed growth, feeding, lipid content, and maturity in a 2-year laboratory experiment simulating the latitudinal light regimes at 52 degrees S and 66 degrees S and constant darkness under constant food level. Our results showed that light regime affected seasonal cycles of growth, feeding, lipid metabolism, and maturity in Antarctic krill. Seasonal patterns of growth, feeding, and maturity persisted under constant darkness, indicating the presence of an endogenous timing system. The maturity cycle showed differences in critical photoperiods according to the simulated latitudinal light regime. This suggests a flexible endogenous timing mechanism in Antarctic krill, which may determine its response to future environmental changes.

Matrix solid phase dispersion was applied for the extraction of the carotenoids. This gentle and expeditious extraction technique for solid and viscous samples leads to distinct higher enrichment rates than the conventional liquid-liquid extraction. The chromatographic separation was achieved employing a C-30 RP column that allows the separation of shape-constrained geometrical isomers. A methanol/tert-butylmethyl ether/water gradient was applied. (all-E) Astaxanthin and the geometrical isomers were identified by HPLC APCI/MS, by coelution with isomerized authentical standard, by UV spectroscopy (DAD), and three isomers were unambiguously assigned by microcoil NMR spectroscopy. In this method, microcoils are transversally aligned to the magnetic field and have an increased sensitivity compared to the conventional double-saddle Helmholtz coils, thus enabling the measurement on small samples. The carotenol fatty acid esters were saponified enzymatically with Lipase type VII from Candida rugosa. The fatty acids were detected by GC MS after transesterification, but also without previous derivatization by HPLC APCI/MS. C14:0, C16:0, C16:1, C18:1, C20:0, C20:5, and C22:6 were found in astaxanthin monoesters and in astaxanthin diesters. (all-E) Astaxanthin was identified as the main isomer in six fatty acid ester fractions by NMR. Quantitation was carried out by the method of internal standard. (13-cis) Astaxanthin (70 mu g/g), 542 mu g/g (all-E) astaxanthin, 36 mu g/g unidentified astaxanthin isomer, 62 mu g/g (9-cis) astaxanthin, and 7842 mu g/g astaxanthin fatty acid esters were found.																	1615-9306	1615-9314				SEP	2005	28	14					1685	1693		10.1002/jssc.200500152							WOS:000232288400009	16224962

In this study, we investigated the Pb2+-induced inhibition and aggregation of Euphausia superba arginine kinase (ESAK) and found that significantly inactivated ESAK in a dose-dependent manner (IC50 = 0.058 +/- 0.002 mM). Spectrofluorimetry results showed that Pb2+ induced tertiary structural changes via the internal polarity increased and the non-polarity decreased in ESAK and directly induced ESAK aggregation. The ESAK aggregation process induced by Pb2+ occurred with multi-phase kinetics. The addition of osmolytes did not show protective effect on Pb2+-induced inactivation of ESAK. The computational molecular dynamics (MD) simulation showed that three Pb2+ interrupt the entrance of the active site of ESAK and it could be the reason on the loss of activity of ESAK. Several important residues of ESAK were detected that were importantly contributed the conformation and catalytic function of ESAK. Our study showed that Pb2+-induced misfolding of ESAK and the complete loss of activity irreversibly, which cannot be recovered by osmolytes. Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

The hydrolysates contained 0.951 g/100 ml amino acid nitrogen, which was sufficient to meet the special grade requirements of soy sauce according to the Chinese National Standard. Meanwhile, the recovery of total nitrogen was 75.33%. The second-stage autolysis exhibited a great positive effect on the improvement of nitrogen recovery. The optimal conditions for obtaining the highest amino acid nitrogen level during the second-stage autolysis were hydrolysate/krill ratio of 2.23, initial pH of 7.23, 40.94 degrees C, which were determined by response surface methodology. The dominant compositions of krill protein hydrolysates were peptides. Proline, glutamate, aspartate, glycine and valine were the dominant amino acids in the hydrolysates, accounting for 15.18, 14.03, 12.14, 10.78 and 10.16 mg/ml, respectively. The hydrolysates prepared by two-stage autolysis had high amino acid nitrogen level and high recovery of total nitrogen, which could be used in the preparation of high quality krill sauce.

A total of 77.1 million clean reads representing similar to 11.0 Gb data were generated. The average length of these reads was 142 bp. De novo assembly yielded 125,211 transcripts with a N50 of 690 bp. Further analysis produced 106,250 unigenes, of which 31,683 were annotated based on protein homology searches against protein databases. Gene ontology analysis showed that ion binding, organic substance, metabolic process, and cell part were the most abundantly used terms in molecular function, biological process and cellular component categories, respectively. In addition, 3067 unigenes were mapped onto 311 signal pathways by the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis. Finally, 15,224 simple sequence repeats were identified from 13,535 transcripts, and 103,593 single-nucleotide polymorphisms were found from 21.6% of total transcripts.

Euphausia superba is limited to the Southern Ocean, while M. norvegica is present from the Arctic Ocean to the Mediterranean Sea. Euphausia superba structural lipids showed little mesoscale variability. Specific differences between phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine fatty acid composition exceeded variability related to sampling stations. On a larger scale (Southern Ocean), fatty acid composition of both total polar lipids and phosphatidylcholine confirmed the reduced level of regional variability. Similar comparisons between female M. norvegica collected at two extreme sites in terms of temperature regime (Kattegat and Ligurian Sea) during two season (spring-summer and fall-winter) suggested a more complex picture. Levels of phosphatidylethanolamine, lysophosphatidylcholine. and diphosphatidylglycerol showed significant differences between sites. During spring-summer, a lower content of phosphatidylethanolamine and lysophosphatidylcholine was observed for the Ligurian Sea population. Fatty acid composition of total polar lipids was significantly different at both sites. Comparisons between spring-summer populations at both sites showed higher percentages of 22:6n-3 and a lower content in saturated and monoenoic acids for the Ligurian Sea, suggesting some degree of adaptation to temperature regime.

E. crystallorophias was limited to inshore waters. Detailed stratified sampling revealed that E. superba formed dense aggregations well below the ice, but was not inhabiting the ice itself. In general, E. superba occupied the depth stratum from 15 to 130 m; few or no other zooplankton were found within E. superba swarms. T. macrura displayed a depth preference for the strata from 90 to 250 m. Size-frequency distributions for E. superba and for T macrura showed that larvae were absent and that both populations were dominated by small adults. A life cycle for T macrura is proposed.																	0171-8630					JUN	1994	109	2-3					131	142		10.3354/meps109131							WOS:A1994NX76600003

The kinetic parameters of pyrolysis reactions were obtained via the distributed activation energy model (DAEM). Experimental results showed that the temperature at which the highest weight loss rate occurred increased from 280 to 315 degrees C as the heating rate increased from 5 to 30 degrees C min(-1). Almost all the volatiles were evolved between 300 and 350 degrees C, while CH4 and aliphatic C-H were also produced at higher-temperature regions. A large amount of CO2 was generated above 650 degrees C by the decomposition of carbonates, and it can be further reduced to CO by ESW char. CO2 was the main non-condensable product, and ketones were the dominating condensable products. The activation energy of pyrolysis reactions increased from 79 to 392 kJ mol(-1) for conversion rates 0.13 to 0.54. The linear relationship between the natural logarithm of the frequency factor and activation energy was also established. The activation energy approximately followed Gaussian distribution, and the mean activation energy was 162 kJ mol(-1).																	2190-6815	2190-6823				JUN	2018	8	2					329	337		10.1007/s13399-017-0281-7							WOS:000432540300010

Euphausia superba occurs in large aggregations south of the Antarctic Convergence, living in extreme climatic conditions. In the Mediterranean Sea, populations of Meganyctiphanes norvegica experience moderate seasonal variations and a stable temperature regime (13-degrees-C). Both species release their eggs in the water column and have similar basic patterns of development. The early seasonal development of the gonads of E. superba (especially ovarian previtellogenesis) is associated with the ice-edge in spring. Egg production is strictly limited to the summer (December, January and February), but multiple spawns are then produced by individual females through a succession of short vitellogenic cycles. Both males and females undergo a sexual regression in winter when only basic activity of the gonads (gametogenesis) is maintained. Ovarian development of M. norvegica starts in January (previtellogenesis) in the Ligurian Sea before the spring bloom. Eggs are produced from February to May by successive vitellogenic cycles. Gonadal activity is reduced during summer and autumn. This timing is different from the northern populations of the species that rather spawn in spring and summer. In both species the seasonal variability in food availability is tempered by storage of carbohydrates and lipids in the fat body for subsequent yolk accumulation in the eggs. These two krill species appear to have adapted their reproductive cycle to different habitats by using the flexibility of the physiological cycles involved in gonad development, a strategy that allows them to enhance fecundity and to tune the reproductive effort with food availability for the offspring.																	0168-8170					AUG	1993	23	2-3					105	114		10.1080/07924259.1993.9672301							WOS:A1993MA13300004

The structure and composition of the AKP, including particle size, Zeta potential, molecular weight distribution, amino acid composition, microstructure and surface elemental composition, changed significantly after chelating with zinc. The result of Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy indicated that zinc could be chelated by carboxyl oxygen and amino nitrogen atoms of the AKP. Furthermore, compared with zinc sulfate and zinc gluconate, the AKP-Zn chelate was more stable at various pH conditions and the simulated gastrointestinal digestion experiment. These findings would provide a scientific basis for developing new zinc supplements and the high-value utilization of Antarctic krill protein resource.																	0308-8146	1873-7072				MAR 15	2021	340								128056	10.1016/j.foodchem.2020.128056							WOS:000593690000007	33032152

This study presents a detailed optimization of the analysis of volatile flavor compounds from Antarctic krill by combining headspace solid-phase microextraction (HS-SPME) as the extracting method and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC-MS) as the analysis. An optimal solid-phase microextraction (SPME) fiber was selected, and the microextraction conditions were optimized using the response surface method (RSM). The Divinylbenzene/Carboxen/Polydimethylsiloxane (DVB/CAR/PDMS) fiber showed the highest extraction efficiency and was selected for further optimization of extraction temperature, extraction time, and sodium chloride concentration. Forty-two types of volatile substances producing characteristic flavors were detected, seven of which contributed significantly to the flavor of Antarctic krill. Ethers, pyrazine, and aldehyde compounds contribute to the main flavor of Antarctic krill. The compounds 2-ethyl-3, 5-dimethyl-pyrazine, 2, 3, 5-trimethyl-6-ethyl-pyrazine, and 3-ethyl-2, 5-dimethyl- pyrazine produce the roasted flavor and the characteristic nutty odor. Moreover (E, Z)-2, 6-nonadienal adds a cucumber fragrance. The compounds 3-methyl-butanal and 3-methional play an important role in determining the overall flavor.																	1094-2912	1532-2386					2017	20			1			S820	S829		10.1080/10942912.2017.1315589							WOS:000423507200071

Embryo development time was significantly related to temperature, and could be expressed either in an exponential model or Belehradek's equation. The Belehradek's equation. D = 2.7 e (-0.27T) + 2.92 D = 65.3(T + 8.8)(-1.13) The Belehradek's equation was compared with previous studies, and also with those on other marine crustaceans. The curve calculated by this equation was similar to those for other arctic zooplankton species. Hatching success ranged from 7 to 58%, and varied between each gravid female. The physical condition of gravid females may affect the embryo quality and the hatching success. The factors that determine embryo development time and hatching success are discussed by comparing the data with those from previous studies performed on euphausiids and other marine crustaceans.

J	Veit, RR				Veit, RR			Behavioural responses by foraging petrels to swarms of Antarctic Krill Euphausia superba	ARDEA												Petrels feeding on Antarctic Krill Euphausia superba use two basic strategies to locate prey patches. One strategy is area-restricted search, in which individuals interrupt straight-line motion on detecting prey, and then circle about. This increased rate of turning near prey increases the likelihood of detecting additional patches, since patches tend to be clumped in space. A second strategy is local enhancement, in which individuals monitor the behaviour of others, and converge on those individuals that display behaviour indicative of feeding. In this paper, attention is focused on the first strategy, area restricted search, and evidence of increased turning rates in the vicinity of krill patches is sought. The hypotheses tested were first, that six species of krill-feeding petrels engage in area restricted search; and then that the tendency for seabirds to either sit on the water, patter with their feet, or seize prey was correlated with the distance to the nearest krill patch. Seabird abundance and behaviour was paired with krill abundance east of South Georgia (55 degrees S, 35 degrees W) in June 1993. Three species, Cape Petrel Daption capense, Northern Giant Petrel Macronectes halli and Southern Giant Petrel M. giganteus, changed their direction of Eight significantly more often when near krill swarms than when in krill-free areas, indicating that they used area restricted search. Cape Petrels were also significantly more likely to sit on the water and to patter along the surface when close to krill swarms.																	0373-2266						1999	87	1					41	50									WOS:000083232300004						
J	Nicol, S; Constable, AJ; Pauly, T				Nicol, S; Constable, AJ; Pauly, T			Estimates of circumpolar abundance of Antarctic krill based on recent acoustic density measurements	CCAMLR SCIENCE												The total circumpolar abundance of Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) is estimated using recent measurements of krill density from acoustic surveys and historical information on the overall range of krill. The biomass estimates fall between 60 and 155 million tonnes at the low end of values that have been suggested in the past. The differences between our estimates and others can be explained by a number of factors such as: an underestimation of the range or the acoustic biomass estimates; the possibility of a large, undetected krill population; and the overestimation of the demand for krill by predators. Even if these low krill biomass estimates are correct, regional and total precautionary limits are still likely to rise as a result of new surveys because the method used to calculate precautionary limits uses a value of 11% of the estimated pre-exploitation biomass. Additionally, the current precautionary catch limits in the South Atlantic are set using a superseded acoustic target strength which has effectively underestimated the krill biomass by a factor of three, so the new survey of the South Atlantic in January 2000 may result in an effective biomass which is greater than the value used in the past. The seasonal and local consequences of large catch limits will have to be taken into account when managing an expanded krill fishery, and the appropriateness of using the existing statistical divisions as management areas will have to be considered.																	1023-4063						2000	7						87	99									WOS:000166295500005

Pyrosequencing and de novo assembly of Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) transcriptome to study the adaptability of krill to climate-induced environmental changes	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY RESOURCES												The Antarctic krill, Euphausia superba, has a key position in the Southern Ocean food web by serving as direct link between primary producers and apex predators. The south-west Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean, where the majority of the krill population is located, is experiencing one of the most profound environmental changes worldwide. Up to now, we have only cursory information about krill's genomic plasticity to cope with the ongoing environmental changes induced by anthropogenic CO2 emission. The genome of krill is not yet available due to its large size (about 48 Gbp). Here, we present two cDNA normalized libraries from whole krill and krill heads sampled in different seasons that were combined with two data sets of krill transcriptome projects, already published, to produce the first knowledgebase krill master' transcriptome. The new library produced 25% more E.superba transcripts and now includes nearly all the enzymes involved in the primary oxidative metabolism (Glycolysis, Krebs cycle and oxidative phosphorylation) as well as all genes involved in glycogenesis, glycogen breakdown, gluconeogenesis, fatty acid synthesis and fatty acids -oxidation. With these features, the master' transcriptome provides the most complete picture of metabolic pathways in Antarctic krill and will provide a major resource for future physiological and molecular studies. This will be particularly valuable for characterizing the molecular networks that respond to stressors caused by the anthropogenic CO2 emissions and krill's capacity to cope with the ongoing environmental changes in the Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean.

The life span of E. superba exceeded 5 yr in the Cosmonaut Sea and 6 yr in the Cooperation Sea. Assuming growth for only 180 d per year, growth rates ranged from 0.120-0.133 mm d(-1) during the first year of life to 0.019-0.022 mm d(-1) during the fifth year. Von Bertalanify growth curves calculated for different areas are similar to those obtained by Australian researchers in the Prydz Bay region for 1981 to 1985, in mid summer, E. superba of age 2+ to 4+ were predominant in all hauls made south of the Antarctic Divergence, while north of the Divergence the krill were clearly dominated by individuals of age 4+. The coefficients of natural mortality (M) of E. superba in the Indian sector of the Southern Ocean, calculated by the methods of Alverson & Carney, Richter and Efanov and Beverton and Holt, varied from 0.72 to 0.87, from 0.52 to 0.57 and from 0.76 to 2.92, respectively. The value of age-dependent natural mortality of E. superba derived using Zikov and Slepokurov's method ranged from 0.52 during the maturation period to 1.1-2.41 during the first and last years of life. Based on long-term observations, the relationship between E. superba age composition and its spawning success is examined for the coastal areas of the Cooperation and Cosmonaut Seas.																	0171-8630					MAR	1995	119	1-3					45	61		10.3354/meps119045							WOS:A1995QR92700005

Published data are scarce and are usually acquired with single camera systems that provide suboptimal control over the measurement accuracy. Here, we describe a stereo photo camera application for accurate krill measurements in situ, based on several Euphausia superba and Meganyctiphanes norvegica datasets. Body tilt orientation, body length, and school volume density from scattered and schooling krill are presented. Some challenges to the practical implementation of the method are discussed, including practical limits on krill body yaw angles for obtaining useful measurement accuracy and how to account accurately for the true vertical. Calibration and measurement accuracy is discussed together with a practical definition of krill body orientation. Krill sizes determined from stereo images are compared with those measured from trawl samples. The krill body tilt measurements yielded mean estimates of positive (head-up) or negative tilt of 9-17 degrees with rather large spread for scattered aggregations of M. norvegica (SD = 30-37 degrees) and about half of that for polarized schools of E. superba (SD = 14-17 degrees). The measured krill body orientation distributions were also used to calculate krill acoustic target strength as predicted by the stochastic distorted wave Born approximation (SDWBA) model.

The lipid content, lipid class, fatty acid and sterol composition of E. superba fed on each cultured phytoplankton and a mixed diet of both species, were determined. No significant difference was found between total lipid levels of E. superba reared on each of these different diets. Phaeocystis pouchetii, although deficient in a number of the essential fatty acids, is apparently an adequate food source for E. superba. The proportion of polyenoic fatty acids varied within lipid classes although there was no significant difference between levels of the long chain polyunsaturate 20:5(n-3) in the total lipid of E. superba fed on these diets. The acid was found to be less than 1% of the total lipid in Phaeocystis pouchetii compared to 37% in Phaeodactylum tricornutum. This suggests that krill may possess the ability to convert exogenous shorter chain fatty acids to 20:5(n-3) and 22:6(n-3). Significant differences were detected in the isomeric ratio of 16:1(n-7c)/16:0 between krill fed the diatom compared to the prymnesiophyte diet. Significant differences were also detected in several shorter chain fatty acids and between fatty acids within their lipid classes. Such differences may have the potential to be used as biochemical signatures to provide information on food sources and possible feeding grounds of E. superba. Phaeocystis pouchetii in a very late stationary phase, although not used in this feeding study, was found to contain 11% of 22:6(n-3) for which there are few substantive sources in natural algal populations.

Euphausia superba as a major control on copepod abundance	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												Euphausia superba thereafter 'krill') and copepods are major zooplankton taxa in the Southern Ocean, but there is Little information on how they interact. This paper investigates their coincidence across a wide range of temporal and spatial scales to examine whether copepod distribution is related to that of krill. During 2 summers of high krill abundance near South Georgia (1996 and 1993) copepod abundance was <40% of that during an abnormally low krill year (1994). No such depletion was found north of the Polar Front, where krill were rare. Analysis of 2 mesoscale data sets showed that krill, rather than food or environmental factors, were most strongly implicated in copepod distribution. An area of persistently high krill abundance just north of South Georgia was characterised by exceptionally few copepods. Fine-scale relationships between patches of krill and copepods were studied with a Longhurst Hardy Plankton Recorder. Within krill swarms copepod abundance was low, but more dispersed krill associated with high concentrations of copepods. Copepods also appeared to live deeper and to make more extensive vertical migrations when krill were present. The inverse relationship between krill and copepod abundances thus occurred repeatedly and across a wide range of scales. The facts that krill swarms are mobile and were unrelated to hydrography further suggest that the inverse relationship was caused by krill. This could arise from competitive exclusion, direct predation or both. Evidence for competition is that South Georgia copepods rely on high phytoplankton biomass for recruitment and krill can remove this. Predation is suggested by the fact that crustaceans were found in krill guts in this region during both summer and winter. During the 1996 summer, experiment tally derived predation rates on copepods, combined with krill biomass values, suggested a significant impact on small copepods. Therefore we suggest that copepod numbers can be controlled by a combination of competition and predation by krill.

MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												Using stomach lavage samples from macaroni penguins Eudyptes chrysolophus Brandt breeding at Bird island, South Georgia and concurrent net samples caught within the penguin foraging range, we examined the potential selection of different length and maturity stages of Antarctic krill Euphausia superba Dana. Using Monte Carlo randomised simulation techniques, we also determined the probability of obtaining length-frequency distributions of krill different from that obtained in the net samples. The krill taken by the macaroni penguins differed significantly from those caught in the nets. Small krill (28 to 38 mm) were absent from the stomach samples, whereas large krill (58 to 62 mm) were more abundant. Random sampling using Monte Carlo simulation techniques produced length-frequency distributions that were statistically different from the original distribution of krill caught in nets on 76 out of 100 trials. Nevertheless, these differences were smaller than those found between the penguin samples and net samples. Comparison of krill maturity stages showed that krill taken by macaroni penguins contained 3 times as many female as male krill, whereas krill caught in nets contained nearly equal proportions. The differences in size and maturity of krill taken by penguins are discussed in terms of aggregated random sampling, prey selection by predators, and evasion by krill of predators and nets. We conclude that the differences are unlikely to be accounted for simply by sampling anomalies; the differences are more Likely to relate to penguins selecting larger, nutritionally superior krill, but might also reflect differential escape responses of particular classes of krill when evading penguins or nets.																	0171-8630					SEP	1996	140	1-3					1	11		10.3354/meps140001							WOS:A1996VJ37700001

The future resilience of krill to climate change depends critically on the winter survival of young krill. To survive periods of extremely low production by pelagic algae during winter, krill are assumed to rely partly on carbon produced by ice algae. The true dependency on ice algae-produced carbon, however, is so far unquantified. This confounds predictions on the future resilience of krill stocks to sea ice decline. Fatty acid (FA) analysis, bulk stable isotope analysis (BSIA), and compound-specific stable isotope analysis (CSIA) of diatom- and dinoflagellate-associated marker FAs were applied to quantify the dependency of overwintering larval, juvenile, and adult krill on ice algae-produced carbon (alpha(ice)) during winter 2013 in the Weddell-Scotia Confluence Zone. Our results demonstrate that the majority of the carbon uptake of the overwintering larval and juvenile krill originated from ice algae (up to 88% of the carbon budget), and that the dependency on ice algal carbon decreased with ontogeny, reaching 56% of the carbon budget in adults. Spatio-temporal variability in the utilization of ice algal carbon was more pronounced in larvae and juvenile krill than in adults. Differences between uice estimates derived from short- vs. long-term FA-specific isotopic compositions suggested that ice algae-produced carbon gained importance as the winter progressed, and might become critical at the late winter-spring transition, before the phytoplankton bloom commences. Where the sea ice season shortens, reduced availability of ice algae might possibly not be compensated by surplus phytoplankton production during wintertime. Hence, sea ice decline could seriously endanger the winter survival of recruits, and subsequently overall biomass of krill.

Spatio-temporal variability in the winter diet of larval and juvenile Antarctic krill, Euphausia superba, in ice-covered waters	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												Antarctic krill Euphausia superba is an ecological key species in the Southern Ocean and a major fisheries resource. The winter survival of age class 0 (AC0) krill is susceptible to changes in the sea-ice environment due to their association with sea ice and their need to feed during their first winter. However, our understanding of their overwintering diet and its variability is limited. We studied the spatio-temporal variability of the diet in 4 cohorts of AC0 krill in the Northern Weddell Sea during late winter 2013 using stomach contents, fatty acids (FAs) and bulk stable isotope analysis (BSIA). Stomach contents were dominated by diatoms in numbers and occasionally contained large volumes of copepods. Many of the prey species found in the stomachs were sea ice-associated. Our results show that the diet of overwintering AC0 krill varies significantly in space and time. Variability in stomach content composition was related to environmental factors, including chlorophyll a concentration, copepod abundance and sea-ice cover. In contrast, FA composition mainly varied between cohorts, indicating variation in the long-term diet. The condition of the AC0 krill was reflected in FA and BSIA analysis, suggesting that the availability of sea ice-derived food sources over a long period may impact the condition of developing AC0 krill significantly. The spatio-temporal availability of sea-ice resources is a potentially important factor for AC0 krill winter survival.

Three-dimensional observations of swarms of Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) made using a multi-beam echosounder	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY												Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) aggregate in dense swarms. Previous investigations of krill swarms have used conventional single- or split-beam echosounders that, with post-processing, provide a two-dimensional (2-D) view of the water column, leaving the third dimension to be inferred. We used a multi-beam echosounder system (SM20, 200 kHz, Kongsberg Mesotech Ltd, Canada) from an inflatable boat (length = 5.5 m) to sample water-column backscatter, particularly krill swarms, directly in 2-D and, with post-processing, to provide a three dimensional (3-D) view of entire krill swarms. The study took place over six days (2-8 February 2006) in the vicinity of Livingston Island, South Shetland Islands, Antarctica (62.4 degrees S, 60.7 degrees W). An automatic 3-D aggregation detection algorithm resolved 1006 krill swarms from the survey data. Principal component analyses indicated that swarm morphology metrics such as length, surface area and volume accounted for the largest between swarm variance, followed by echo energy, and finally swarm geographic location. Swarms did not form basic cylindrical or spherical shapes, but had quite consistent surface area to volume ratios of 3.3 m(-1). Swarms were spatially segregated, with larger sizes (mean north-south length = 276 m, at least double that of two other swarm classifications), found to the northwest of the survey area. The apparent clustering of swarm types suggests that krill biomass surveys and ecosystem investigations may require stratified survey design, in response to varying 3-D swarm morphology, variation that may be driven in turn by environmental characteristics such as bathymetry.

Mortality was significantly higher for reproductive males (100%, n = 68) than for females (3%, n = 186) within the first 3 d of capture. Total lipid and triacylglycerol levels in male, female and juvenile Euphausia superba were analysed and compared. All reproductive male krill analysed from this swarm had low lipid levels (1 to 3% dry weight) with negligible triacylglycerol stores (0 to 2% of total lipid). Somatic lipid stores in female and juvenile krill ranged from 8 to 30%, of which up to 40% was triacylglycerol. The levels of algal sterols in the digestive gland of males, females and juveniles indicate that all krill had been feeding recently. An analysis of the sex ratio of krill catches derived from data collected over seven summers from the Prydz Bay region showed a decrease in the proportion of males with increasing size. There was a sharp decline in numbers of male krill once they attained a length of 51 to 55 mm. Low lipid levels in redroductive male krill may be due to reproductive costs. The resulting low storage-lipid levels are accompanied by high mortality in male krill.

This represents a considerable input of energy which was estimated using a combination of measured mass and energy differences in female krill and from the measured energetic content of ovarian tissue. Large (c. 50 mm) female krill lose 2.9-3.8 kJ each time a batch of eggs is laid.

The enzyme was used as a model to compare temperature-dependent enzymatic parameters of Antarctic krill, Euphausia superba, with those of a euphausiid species (Meganyctiphanes norvegica) found in both the Scandinavian Kattegat and the Mediterranean. Other species examined were an Antarctic isopod, Serolis polita, and a tropical crab, Ocypode ryderi. Enzyme isoforms of NAGase were isolated chromatographically. Temperature optimum (between 30 and 53-degrees-C) and activation-energy (47-59 kJ.mol-1) of isoenzymes were generally unrelated to genotypic cold adaptation. Although pH profiles were temperature-dependent, there was no apparent temperature-related control of activities by pH in the experienced physiological range. In contrast, apparent Michaelis constants showed minima at ambient water temperatures (total range: 0.1-0.6 mol . l-1). Potentially, enzyme variants play a role in acclimatisation regulated by Michaelis constants. Apparently, the rate-limiting effects of polar temperatures are partly compensated in the Antarctic crustaceans by construction of enzymes with substrate affinities similar to those of species from warmer climates. The significance of apparent Michaelis constants in evaluating mechanisms of metabolic cold compensation is discussed. Necessary additional experimental approaches are highlighted.																	0174-1578	1432-136X				FEB	1993	163	1					28	37		10.1007/BF00309662							WOS:A1993KP18600005

Spatial association between hotspots of baleen whales and demographic patterns of Antarctic krill Euphausia superba suggests size-dependent predation	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												We examined the spatial association between baleen whales and their principal prey, Antarctic krill Euphausia superba near the South Shetland Islands (Antarctic Peninsula) using data collected by the US Antarctic Marine Living Resources (AMLR) program during January surveys from 2003 through 2007. Whale distributions were determined using ship-based visual surveys, while data on krill distribution, abundance, and demographic characteristics were derived from net hauls. Approximately 25 000 km of transects and 500 net hauls were sampled over 5 yr. We defined hotspots based on statistical criteria to describe persistent areas of occurrence of both whales and krill. Hotspots were identified, and whales and krill length-maturity classes exhibited distinct spatial segregation in their distribution patterns. We found that baleen whales aggregated to krill hotspots that differed in size structure. Humpback whales Megaptera novaeangliae were associated with small (<35 mm) juvenile krill in Bransfield Strait, whereas fin whales Balaenoptera physalus were associated with large (>45 mm) mature krill located offshore. Overlapping these size-dependent krill distributions, Antarctic minke whales B. bonaerensis were associated with intermediate sized krill (35-44 mm). The correlation among different whale species and krill swarms of differing size composition presents an intriguing pattern that deserves further study.																	0171-8630	1616-1599					2010	405						255	269		10.3354/meps08513							WOS:000278041300019

Euphausia superba makes an abrupt behavioral transition after the last larval molt from an individualistic. planktonic lifestyle to that of a highly social, nektonic juvenile. Then and throughout the rest of its life, most aspects of krill behavior are expressed within the context of highly organized, polarized schools. A krill school is an integrated whole that displays properties greater than the sum of its parts. Emergent attributes of the aggregate evolve in response to a suite of positive and negative selective factors that act on entire schools as well as individuals. We evaluate the individual advantages and disadvantages of living within large schools of conspecific euphausiids primarily for foraging, antipredator behavior, and epidemiology. We review the history of research on krill behavior, comment on the current state of knowledge, and suggest new avenues for future investigations.																	0706-652X	1205-7533					2000	57			3			192	202		10.1139/cjfas-57-S3-192							WOS:000166531600017

The results show the existence of a shelf break front during each period. The most reliable means of defining the front was the potential density anomaly at the near-surface potential temperature minimum. In each year, off-shelf waters were separated from on-shelf waters by water with a potential density anomaly between 27.22 and 27.29 kg m(-3). During 1997/98, the near-surface potential temperature minimum was much colder and much shallower than in other years and was consistent with waters originating from much further south than South Georgia; these differences were further evident at a single deep off-shelf station. The oceanographic changes during 1997/98 were consistent with a mesoscale or large-scale movement of the southern Antarctic Circumpolar Current front. Acoustically determined densities of Antarctic krill, Euphausia superba, at South Georgia showed consistent patterns between years. Densities were substantially higher over the shelf compared with off-shelf, with the highest densities at the shelf edge; densities were also higher to the east of the island. During 1997/98, acoustic densities of krill were substantially higher than in other years. The coincidence of the elevated acoustic density and the cooler oceanographic conditions was explored. When data from all years were combined and analysed by Generalized Additive Model, an inverse relationship between acoustic density and temperature was apparent. Historical data were also examined and it was noted that the only other occurrence of such a high estimate of krill density at South Georgia, was when oceanographic conditions were also colder.

SOLUTION PROPERTIES	CARBOHYDRATE POLYMERS												A technological development of chitosan (copolymer of N-acetylglucosamine and glucosamine) is based on the knowledge of parameters such as composition, types of sequence, chain length and distribution. In addition to the sample source, these factors are related to preparation and purification methods. In this connection the authors examined chitosan samples having the same origin (Euphausia superba), but different degrees of acetylation, as well as materials which were subjected to regeneration and beating processes. In addition, the authors prepared chitosan samples of different degrees of polymerization by hydrolysis of commercial chitosan of high degree of acetylation under different pH and temperature conditions. The samples were characterized in 0.1N CH3COOH (HAc) - 0.2M NaCl by intrinsic viscosity ([eta]) and light scattering techniques. The viscometric behaviour of the starting chitosans and of all depolymerization products follows an expected pattern. On the other hand. light scattering shows important differences among samples having identical [eta], but obtained under different hydrolysis conditions. A tentative explanation is suggested for the discrepant responses.

The metanauplius lacks an elaborated stomach as well as a connection between the esophagus and the midgut. In calyptopis I, the stomach becomes functional. The armature of the cardiac stomach consists of basic components such as lateral and ventral projections and stout spines, but not a primary filter. The latter develops before molt beneath the cuticle and is seen in the exuvial space of calyptopis II. With molting to calyptopis III, the primary filter is elaborated and becomes capable of sorting food particles and of separating a dorsal food from a ventral filtration channel. Although in furcilia IV the spacing of spines in the primary filter is nearly identical to that in the adult specimens, the filter spines in calyptopis III are more widely separated. In all larval stages examined (except furcilia IV), the development of the pyloric stomach is delayed with respect to that of the cardiac stomach. Residues of a pyloric secondary filter system were not found in developing stages of Euphausia superba.																	0278-0372					AUG	1993	13	3					423	431		10.2307/1548785							WOS:A1993LT33600003

Purified AM was obtained on a large scale from crude extract extracted from Antarctic krill in 38.14 % yield by silica gel column chromatography. After the AM was saponified with methanolic KOH (0.10 mol L-1) and separated by high-performance thin-layer chromatography, pure astaxanthin was obtained. There was only one optical (3R, 3'R)-isomer of the esterification of astaxanthin with (-)-camphanic acid chloride detected by high-performance liquid chromatography compared with astaxanthin standard. It was further proved that the AM consists of only one optical (3R, 3'R)-isomer. Twelve types of fatty acids in the AM from Antarctic krill were found by gas chromatography-mass spectrometer. Eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic acids are the major fatty acids. It is the first time to prepare (3R, 3'R)-AM and (3R, 3'R)-astaxanthin from Antarctic krill.

The solubility of Antarctic krill proteins and their fluoride content were studied between pH 1.00-13.75. The previous krill protein extraction conditions using ISP were improved. Excess fluoride in Antarctic krill was removed using a water-washing method according to its solubility. To save water, a multistage countercurrent system was used to optimize the ISP method. The results showed that the solubility of Antarctic krill proteins reached a minimum at pH 4.5 and a maximum at pH 13.5, while the concentration of dissolved fluoride was relatively unchanged (16.78-20.50 mg/L), with pH 2.00-13.50. Water-washing 4 times could reduce fluoride 98.14 +/- 0.01% from krill with about a 5.14 +/- 0.21% protein loss. The reduction allows krill protein to meet the Chinese National Standard (GB 2762-2005) for fluoride. Meanwhile, the four-stage countercurrent system achieved almost the same high fluoride removal rate (98.58 +/- 0.01%) using only 25% of the water.																	1049-8850	1547-0636					2016	25	4					597	606		10.1080/10498850.2014.904461							WOS:000381280000013

Lipid composition of the body and digestive gland of Euphausia superba in controlled conditions	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												To examine the potential of lipids as dietary markers in Euphausia superba Dana, juvenile krill were fed 4 phytoplankton diets (diatoms, cryptomonads, dinoflagellates and thraustochytrids over a range of food concentrations) and 2 species of zooplankton (rotifers and Artemia sp.) for 20 d. Lipid content, lipid class and fatty acid (FA) composition were analysed for whole krill and digestive glands (DG). Changes detected in whole krill were almost entirely associated with the lipid variability observed in DG. With marked diet-induced changes, DG lipids were the major repository for the trophic signal in krill. DG lipid content increased in krill fed on phytoplankton due to the accumulation of polar lipid (0.5 mg per DG) and triacylglycerol (up to 1.7 mg per DG). Herbivorous diets induced distinct FA signatures in the DG, characterised by higher proportions of: 16:1 omega 7 and 20:5 omega 3 in diatom-fed krill; 18:1 omega 9 and 18:4 omega 3 in cryptomonad-fed krill; 18:1 omega 9, 18A omega 3 + 18:5 omega 3 and 22:6 omega 3 in dinoflagellate-fed krill; and 14:0 and 22:6 omega 3 in thraustochytrid-fed krill. Dietary FA markers increased in relative proportion (% total FA) in the DG with increasing concentration of each particular food. Krill fed rotifers or Artemia sp. showed relatively low DG lipid content, with only slightly higher proportions of 18:2 omega 6 than observed with phytoplankton diets. Zooplankton diets induced no significant difference in FA composition in relation to the species of zooplankton used as prey or to the algal type consumed by these prey.

Temporal changes in digestive gland lipid composition of Euphausia superba in controlled conditions	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												Two phytoplankton diets with markedly different fatty acid (FA) profiles (thraustochytrid and diatom over a range of concentrations) were fed to juvenile Euphausia superba Dana to evaluate the time lapse required for the development of trophic lipid signatures in the digestive gland (DG). Krill were collected after 5, 10 and 20 d of feeding on thraustochytrids. Krill fed on thraustochytrids for 20 d were also collected after a further 5, 10 and 20 d of feeding on diatoms. An accumulation of polar lipid (0.4 mg per DG) was observed after 5 d of feeding on thraustochytrids at every concentration of food, The deposition of triacylglycerol (0.25 mg per DG) required 10 d of feeding and only occurred at the 2 highest food concentrations. Amounts of thraustochytrid-derived FA, 14:0, 16:0 22:6 omega 3 and 22:5 omega 6, increased after 10 d of feeding. The final concentration of 22:6 omega 3 was dependent on food concentration. Though it was absent in the diet, the essential FA 20:5 omega 3 accumulated from the retroconversion of 22:6 omega 3 after 20 d. Changing the krill diet to diatoms resulted in a marked decline in thraustochytrid FA, particularly 14:0 and 22:6 omega 3, after 5 d, whilst diatom FA, 16:1 omega 7 and 20:5 omega 3, remained constant. Thraustochytrid signatures were completely erased from the FA profiles of DG after 20 d feeding on diatoms. Slow accumulation of storage lipid and short residence time of dietary FA suggest that lipid turnover rates are high in Antarctic krill DG.

We assume that the mass of cast exoskeletons originated from a synchronous moult of thousands of individuals. Depending on the size of the krill moulted, the amount of exoskeletons corresponded to a krill abundance of 1,480-48,000 individuals per 1,000 m(3).

J	Buchholz, F				Buchholz, F			Experiments on the physiology of Southern and Northern krill, Euphausia superba and Meganyctiphanes norvegica, with emphasis on moult and growth - A review	MARINE AND FRESHWATER BEHAVIOUR AND PHYSIOLOGY					International Workshop on Understanding Living Krill for Improved Management and Stock Assessment	OCT 01-04, 2002	NAGOYA, JAPAN					Physiological data are needed for life history studies on krill, and as parameters for input into energy budgets and models. In conjunction with moult and growth data, these may also prove useful for assessing the fishable biomass of krill. Here, the development of physiological concepts in experimental krill research is briefly evaluated, with emphasis on the gaps to be filled. Krill growth is very flexible, as well as strongly temperature and nutrition dependent. The polar Antarctic krill Euphausia superba grows as fast as the boreal species Meganyctiphanes norvegica , at least during the first 2.5 years, and the species are comparable in terms of physiological plasticity. Accordingly, as krill appear to adjust quickly to specific laboratory conditions, short-term experiments are essential if field conditions are to be reflected as closely as possible. Furthermore, direct comparisons between laboratory experiments and swarming studies in the field are advantageous. For these, M. norvegica is particularly well-suited, as swarms can be followed over longer times and more easily than in E. superba . For example, processes of moult and reproduction were found to be highly coordinated in swarms and populations of Northern krill. For this species a conceptual model of reproduction was developed based on a combination of short-term laboratory observations coupled with field data on moult and ovary stages. In further physiological experiments krill should be studied as groups when swarming. Using proxies, that is applying physiological and/or biochemical methods side by side, is a promising way to enhance the reliability of life history data.																	1023-6244	1029-0362				DEC	2003	36	4					229	247		10.1080/10236240310001623376							WOS:000187994400005

It resides in cold environments with the most abundant biomass to support the Antarctic ecology and fisheries. Here, we performed the first genome survey of the Antarctic krill, with genomic evidence for its estimated genome size of 42.1 gigabases (Gb). Such a large genome, however, is beyond our present capability to obtain a good assembly, although our sequencing data are a valuable genetic resource for subsequent polar biomedical research. We extracted 13 typical protein-coding gene sequences of the mitochondrial genome and analyzed simple sequence repeats (SSRs), which are useful for species identification and origin determination. Meanwhile, we conducted a high-throughput comparative identification of putative antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) and antihypertensive peptides (AHTPs) from whole-body transcriptomes of the Antarctic krill and its well-known counterpart, the whiteleg shrimp (Penaeus vannamei; resident in warm waters). Related data revealed that AMPs/AMP precursors and AHTPs were generally conserved, with interesting variations between the two crustacean species. In summary, as the first report of estimated genome size of the Antarctic krill, our present genome survey data provide a foundation for further biological research into this polar species. Our preliminary investigations on bioactive peptides will bring a new perspective for the in-depth development of novel marine drugs.

J	Watkins, JL; Murray, AWA; Daly, HI				Watkins, JL; Murray, AWA; Daly, HI			Variation in the distribution of antarctic krill Euphausia superba around south Georgia	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												There is considerable spatial structure within the South Georgia krill-based ecosystem in terms of predator demand, commercial fishery pressure and krill abundance. Here we investigate the hypothesis that there is also spatial structure in the krill population composition, finding differences in length-frequency histograms between the eastern and western ends of the island. Between 1981 and 1997 the British Antarctic Survey carried out 6 major cruises where krill were taken from both ends of South Georgia. Cluster analysis revealed that the length-frequency histograms could be grouped into 4 main types with relatively simple biological characteristics: Cluster 1 contained small krill (mean size 23.9 mm) up to 2 yr old (1+ yr class); Cluster 2 (mean size 31.1 mm) contained a mixture of 1+ with some 2+ and 3+ yr classes; Cluster 3 contained medium-sized krill (mean size 41.4 mm) probably 2+ and 3+ yr classes; Cluster 4 contained large krill (mean size 50.3 mm) likely to be 3+ or older. Principal components analysis (PCA) provided good separation of these clusters using the first 2 axes (80 % of the total variance). There were no obvious differences in the length composition of krill sampled from different water depths, although there were some indications that differences did occur between different water masses. Detailed inspection of the individual cruises revealed that the length-frequency histograms at the western end of the island contained more large krill than those from the eastern end of the island and also that when Weddell Sea water was found within a cruise then this contained the smallest krill. We consider that such differences may arise not only because krill may experience different conditions at each end of the island but also may originate from 2 separate sources which may have different population structures.																	0171-8630						1999	188						149	160		10.3354/meps188149							WOS:000084085700014						
J	Marrari, M; Daly, KL; Hu, CM				Marrari, Marina; Daly, Kendra L.; Hu, Chuanmin			Spatial and temporal variability of SeaWiFS chlorophyll a distributions west of the Antarctic Peninsula: Implications for krill production	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY												ScaWiFS chlorophyll a distributions between 1997 and 2004 were investigated in relation to sea-ice dynamics for waters west of the Antarctic Peninsula (55-75 degrees S, 50-80 degrees W) in order to better understand the reproductive patterns and recruitment success of the Antarctic krill, Euphausia superba. Climatology patterns showed that the Bellingshausen Sea and Marguerite Bay region usually had higher chlorophyll a concentrations, which persisted throughout austral spring and summer, compared with more northern regions along the Antarctic Peninsula and the western Scotia Sea. These predictable and long-lasting phytoplankton accumulations could provide krill with the food levels required for successful reproduction and larval survival. Unusually high krill reproduction in 2000/2001 was coincident with above-average chlorophyll a concentrations throughout most of the study area and resulted in the largest juvenile recruitment (in 2001/2002) since 1981. High larval densities (up to 132 ind m(-3)) at the shelf break along the Antarctic Peninsula may have resulted, in part, from krill spawning in the Bellingshausen Sea. In general, ice-edge blooms were only a significant feature in the southern sectors of our study area, particularly in the Bellingshausen Sea and, thus, may not support krill reproduction in the northern Peninsula region as previously believed. Instead, phytoplankton blooms during spring in the northern region appeared to be governed by shelf-break processes, such as upwelling of iron-rich deep water. Interannual differences in sea ice also probably contributed to the variability in larval krill abundances observed in Marguerite Bay. Sea ice melted early in 2000/2001, allowing elevated phytoplankton blooms to develop. In contrast, sea ice persisted throughout spring and summer 2001/2002 limiting phytoplankton accumulation, particularly in southern Marguerite Bay. Thus, the early and extended availability of elevated chlorophyll a concentrations during spring and summer 2000/2001, particularly in the vicinity of Marguerite Bay and to the south in the Bellingshausen Sea, as well as reduced sea ice in coastal areas, likely supported the unusually high densities of larval krill observed during fall in waters west of the Antarctic Peninsula.

J	Reid, K				Reid, K			Growth of Antarctic krill Euphausia superba at South Georgia	MARINE BIOLOGY												Antarctic krill Euphausia superba has a central role in the ecosystem of the Southern Ocean and knowledge of its growth rate is central to determining the factors influencing population dynamics. The length of Antarctic krill in the diet of Antarctic fur seals Arctocephalus gazella at South Georgia revealed a consistent increase in size between ca. 42 and ca. 54 mm over the period October-March, indicating growth rates much higher than predicted by existing models. Geographical variation in growth rate may result in 2-year-old krill at South Georgia attaining the same size as 3-year-old krill in the Antarctic Peninsula region. The effect of geographical variation in growth rate on the population structure of krill has important implications for comparing the fate of individual cohorts over large scales and in the interpretation of krill life-cycles.																	0025-3162	1432-1793				JAN	2001	138	1					57	62		10.1007/s002270000425							WOS:000166738900006

In this study, Antarctic krill was treated with dandelion polysaccharide (DP) and stored frozen at -8 degrees C for 12 months. The changes in thiobarbituric acid reactants (TBARs), peroxide values (PVs), free fatty acid (FFA) content, fatty acid composition and sensory quality score were evaluated. Treatment with DP maintained the PV, TBAR and FFA contents and sensory quality score and increased the unsaturated fatty acid contents. Results showed that DP treatment could be a promising way to suppresses lipid oxidation and extend the shelf life of Antarctic krill.

In single step extraction, hill-to-water ratio and pH were chosen as 1:10 and 12.5 respectively, in order to extract more protein. In the multi-step dissolution process, the protein solubility of aqueous solution at pH 12.5 was 33.0 +/- 0.8 mg/mL. Multi-step cross-flow processing testified the feasibility of multi-stage countercurrent assumption. Three-stage countercurrent method using krill-to-water ratio 1:10 extracted, 95.1 +/- 0.6% protein from krill, where almost the same water as previous works.

J	Perissinotto, R; Pakhomov, EA; McQuaid, CD; Froneman, PW				Perissinotto, R; Pakhomov, EA; McQuaid, CD; Froneman, PW			In situ grazing rates and daily ration of Antarctic krill Euphausia superba feeding on phytoplankton at the Antarctic Polar Front and the Marginal Ice Zone	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												Measurements of krill gut pigment content, evacuation rates and digestive efficiency were obtained during January 1993 in the Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean, between the Antarctic Marginal Ice Zone (MIZ) and the Polar Front Zone (PFZ). These were combined with net and acoustically derived abundance and biomass data to estimate the in situ grazing of Euphausia superba on the phytoplankton assemblages. Individual ingestion rates of krill were 1.5 to 3 times higher than rates previously obtained with in vitro incubations. Gut pigment levels and evacuation rates varied in the range of 0.01 to 10 mu g chlorophyll a equivalents (chi a equiv.) ind(-1) and 0.10 to 0.31 h(-1), respectively. Pigment losses to non-fluorescing products during digestion were very high, in the range of 67 to 90% of the total pigment ingested, indicating that some of the gut pigment levels previously obtained without correction for digestive losses may have been underestimated by up to an order of magnitude. Krill population impact on the phytoplankton stock exhibited a large variability, in the range of 0.0014 to 2.68% of total integrated chlorophyll a and 0.023 to 50.8% of primary production consumed per day. The largest variations in impact levels were associated with the method used to estimate krill abundance and biomass, with net derived estimates being much lower (by as much as 2 orders of magnitude) than those obtained from acoustic data. Daily carbon rations obtained from our measurements of pigment ingestion rates are among the lowest recorded for E. superba during the summer season and, with 1 exception, ranged between 0.15 and 1.68% of body carbon per day. A daily ration of similar to 13% body carbon was recorded only at 1 station in the MIZ which exhibited a dense phytoplankton bloom of similar to 3.5 pg chi I-1. On the basis of the energetic requirements of the summer krill population, it is suggested that throughout the PFZ and the MIZ E. superba must consume a much larger proportion of heterotrophic carbon than previously supposed. Gut content analysis suggests that this is achieved by predation on meso- and microzooplankton.

The X- ray powder patterns indicated a decrease of order with decreasing the degree of acetylation as well as after regeneration and acid treatments. Similarly, the CP-MAS C-13-NMR and FTIR spectra exhibited a general broadening of signals suggesting the occurrence of new conformations for chitosans after regeneration.

Furthermore, Trp-Phe, Tyr-Arg-Lys, Phe-Gln-Lys, and Phe-Ala-Ser did not only increase the nitric oxide (NO) concentration and decreased the content of endothelin-1 (ET-1) in the medium of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) in a dose dependent manner after 24 h, but also significantly reversed the decreased production of NO in the presence of 0.5 mu M norepinephrine and the effect of NE on ET-1 production.

One such factor that remains poorly known is the role of parasites. A recent study of krill diet using DNA analysis of gut contents provided a snapshot of the parasites present within 170 E. superba guts in a small area along the West Antarctic Peninsula. These parasites included Metschnikowia spp. fungi, Haptoglossa sp. peronosporomycetes, Lankesteria and Paralecudina spp. apicomplexa, Stegophorus sp. nematodes, and Pseudocollinia spp. ciliates. Of these parasites, Metschnikowia spp. fungi and Pseudocollinia spp. ciliates had previously been observed in E. superba, as had other genera of apicomplexans, though not Lankesteria and Paralecudina. In contrast, nematodes had previously only been observed in eggs of E. superba, and there are no literature reports of peronosporomycetes in euphausiids. Pseudocollinia spp., parasitoids which obligately kill their host, were the most frequently observed infection, with a prevalence of 12%. The wide range of observed parasites and the relatively high frequency of infections suggest parasites may play a more important role than previously acknowledged in E. superba ecology and population dynamics.																	0954-1020	1365-2079				FEB	2019	31	1					16	22		10.1017/S0954102018000469							WOS:000459031700004

The following assayes were performed: lipid composition (TLC), fatty acid composition (GC), lipid susceptibility to oxidation, and carotenoids content. The krill harvested in July/August was found to contain about 3% of lipids. The amount of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA; eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic acids) in total lipids of whole krill accounts for 19.0 +/- 1.7% of fatty acids. There was no any lost of n-3 PUFA during processes used to obtain the precipitate and the lipid formula. Euphausia superba is a valuable source of n-3 PUFA, primarily because of their stability in krill.																	0027-769X						1994	38	2					128	134									WOS:A1994NJ48700003

It was found that the diatom Thalassiosira is preferred by E. superba as a food item and small pennate diatoms, Nitzschia. and Navicula are only tolerated as food. Other algae taxa, such as Tropidoneis, Dactyliosolen, Chaetoceros, and Gyrodinium, are clearly avoided. With respect to phytoplankton cell size, E. superba prefers cells with a length of 20-40 mu m and cells larger than 70 mu m are rejected, Trophic conditions only slightly affect the food selection of E. superba.																	0722-4060					APR	1997	17	4					350	357		10.1007/PL00013376							WOS:A1997WN68000007

Levels of photosynthetically active radiation 3-5 times below surface irradiance caused krill to die within a week, while animals in the dark survived. Addition of ultraviolet-B typical of depths up to 15 m were found to significantly accelerate mortality and lead to a drop in activity in all experiments.

DNA as a dietary biomarker in antarctic krill, Euphausia superba	MARINE BIOTECHNOLOGY												The diet of Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) has been studied using a variety of techniques, but current methods still suffer from problems that are difficult to solve. This study examined an alternative approach utilizing DNA as a prey biomarker. Methods were developed for the preservation, extraction, and identification of prey DNA from krill collected in the field. Group-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to amplify diatom prey (Phylum: Bacillariophyta) and the results from DNA clone libraries were compared with microscopic diet analysis. DNA analysis was superior to microscopy for prey detection. However, differences in prey relative abundance estimates between the two techniques suggested some bias in the DNA-based estimates. Quantification showed that large amounts of prey DNA had been successfully preserved and extracted. Overall the results suggest that the application of DNA-based diet analysis to krill warrants further investigation, particularly for prey that are difficult to study using other methods.

CKP activity was high from December to February (in summer) and was low from March to August (in winter). CKP activity and mean feed intake index had a high correlation coefficient by Pearson's correlation coefficient test (P < 0.05). These results suggest that the seasonal variation of CKP activity coincides with the seasonal prevalence of some phytoplanktons as feed for krill. In summer, phytoplankton is plentiful so that krill teed on them and the krill protease activity remains high, but in winter phytoplankton abundance is low and krill do not have to keep their proteolytic activity high.																	0919-9268	1444-2906				FEB	2005	71	1					12	19		10.1111/j.1444-2906.2005.00925.x							WOS:000227249900002

The masses of the CPA enzymes are likely 23,170 and 23,260 Da. whereas the CPB enzyme masses likely are 33,730 and 33,900 Da, The degradation efficiency and cleavage pattern of the trypsin-like proteinases were studied with native myoglobin as a model substrate using CE, MALDI-TOF-MS, and nanoelectrospray mass spectrometry (nESI-MS). The degradation efficiency of the trypsin-like proteinases was found to be approximately 12 and 60 times higher compared to bovine trypsin at 37 degreesC and 1-3 degreesC, respectively. All three fractions of trypsin-like proteinases showed a carboxypeptidase activity in combination with their trypsin activity. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science (USA). All rights reserved.

Population genetic variation of the Southern Ocean krill, Euphausia superba, in the Western Antarctic Peninsula region based on mitochondrial single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY												The Southern Ocean krill, Euphausia superba, is one of the best-studied marine zooplankton species in terms of population genetic diversity and structure; with few exceptions, previous studies have shown the species to be genetically homogeneous at larger spatial scales. The goals of this study are to examine sub-regional scale population genetic diversity and structure of E. superba using molecular characters selected with this goal in mind, and to thereby examine hypotheses of the source(s) of recruitment for krill populations of the Western Antarctic Peninsula (WAP). Collections were made throughout the WAP region during US GLOBEC cruises in austral fall, 2001 and 2002. A total of 585 E. superba (including all 6 furcilia larval stages, juveniles, and adults) was analyzed after confirmation of species identification using a competitive multiplexed species-specific PCR (SS-PCR) reaction based on mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I (mtCOI) sequences. The molecular markers used were allele frequencies at single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) sites in the gene encoding mitochondria! Cytochrome b (cyt 6). Four SNP sites that showed desirable patterns of allelic variation were selected; alleles were detected using a multiplexed single-base extension PCR protocol. A total of 22 SNP haplotypes (i.e., strings of polymorphisms at the four SNP sites) was observed; haplotype diversity (Hd)=0.811 (s.d.=0.008). Analysis of molecular variation within and among samples, areas (i.e., Marguerite Bay, Crystal Sound, shelf, and offshore) and collection years revealed no difference between 2001 and 2002 collections overall, although differences between 2001 and 2002 collections from Marguerite Bay explained 7.4% of the variance (F-ST=0.072; p=0.002 +/- 0.001). Most of the variation (96.3%) occurred within samples each year, with no significant differentiation among areas. There was small, but significant differentiation among samples within areas in 2001 (4.6%; F-ST=0.045; p=0.015 +/- 0.003) and 2002 (6.3%; F-ST=0.062; p=0.000 +/- 0.000). There was evidence of life stage-specific spatial differentiation for furcilia in 2002 for F1 (18.1%, p=0.000 +/- 0.000) and F2 (9.2%, p=0.001 +/- 0.001). The significant differentiation among samples for E. superba within areas was interpreted as evidence of multiple sources of recruitment of E. superba in the WAP region, consistent with advective transport in observed circulation patterns and reproduction and spawning in both offshore and shelf habitats. Further population genetic analysis at sub-regional scales is needed to understand and eventually predict population dynamic processes (e.g., recruitment, migration, retention, and over-wintering) of Southern Ocean krill.

J	Marrari, M; Daly, KL; Timonin, A; Semenova, T				Marrari, Marina; Daly, Kendra L.; Timonin, Alexander; Semenova, Tatjana			The zooplankton of Marguerite Bay, western Antarctic Peninsula-Part II: Vertical distributions and habitat partitioning	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY												The vertical distribution patterns of the dominant zooplankton in the vicinity of Marguerite Bay on the west side of the Antarctic Peninsula were studied during austral fall of 2001 and 2002, using net and concurrent environmental data. Vertical distributions of zooplankton usually were similar to those reported for other Antarctic regions. Maximum abundances of the copepods Ctenocalanus spp. and Calanus propinquus, the euphausiids Euphausia superba, Euphausia crystallorophias, and Thysanoessa macrura, and appendicularians primarily occurred in shallow Antarctic Surface Water (<100 m) or the upper pycnocline. The copepod, Oncaea spp., mysids, and ostracods had the deepest distributions (>250 m), in warmer modified Circumpolar Deep Water. Other dominant copepods (Calanoides acutus, Metridia gerlachei, Oithona spp., Paraeuchaeta spp., and Rhincalanus gigas), pteropods, and chaetognaths had depths of maximum abundance within the pycnocline or in deeper warmer waters. Overlapping depth distributions suggest that E. superba would have the highest prey encounter rates with M. gerlachei, Ctenocalanus spp., C. propinquus, and Oithona spp. during fall, although most of the copepod community was deeper than the euphausiid community. Even though the three euphausiid species occupied similar depth ranges on average, at any given location E. superba, E. crystallorophias, and T. macrura depths of maximum abundance often did not overlap, suggesting vertical habitat partitioning behavior. The vertical patterns of copepods, euphausiids, amphipods, and mysids did not have a consistent association with the distributions of pigments, temperature, salinity, or density. Instead, the observed vertical distributions are mainly attributed to different behaviors, including seasonal vertical migration to deeper water for overwintering (i.e., C. acutus, R. gigas, ostracods, chaetognaths, pteropods) and vertical habitat partitioning to reduce competition (i.e., euphausiids). Migration into deep water and aggregation behavior (i.e., euphausiids) also reduce the risk of predation. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Size Selection of Antarctic Krill (Euphausia superba) in Trawls	PLOS ONE												Trawlers involved in the Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) fishery use different trawl designs, and very little is known about the size selectivity of the various gears. Size selectivity quantifies a given trawl's ability to catch different sizes of a harvested entity, and this information is crucial for the management of a sustainable fishery. We established a morphological description of krill and used it in a mathematical model (FISHSELECT) to predict the selective potential of diamond meshes measuring 5-40 mm with mesh opening angles (oa) ranging from 10 to 90 degrees. We expected the majority of krill to encounter the trawl netting in random orientations due to high towing speeds and the assumed swimming capabilities of krill. However, our results indicated that size selectivity of krill is a well-defined process in which individuals encounter meshes at an optimal orientation for escapement. The simulation-based results were supported by data from experimental trawl hauls and underwater video images of the mesh geometry during fishing. Herein we present predictions for the size selectivity of a range of netting configurations relevant to the krill fishery. The methods developed and results described are important tools for selecting optimal trawl designs for krill fishing.

Phytoplankton odor modifies the response of Euphausia superba to flow	POLAR BIOLOGY												Antarctic krill, Euphausia superba, are critical components of the Antarctic food web as well as important targets for conservation and management. Krill behavior has important effects on demographic properties and aggregation characteristics, but remains incompletely known. Krill clearly respond to different environmental stimuli such as light, flow and chemicals, but few studies have quantified these behaviors. We examined the behavior of krill in well-quantified current speeds in a laboratory flume and examined interactions of phytoplankton odor and flow. Krill are sensitive to flow speeds as low as 1 mm s(-1), and flow polarizes krill swimming and orientation in the up-current direction. Phytoplankton odor increases the sensitivity of krill to flow, and induces area-restricted search behaviors that presumably allow krill to exploit food patches efficiently. The ability to quantify krill behavior could have important consequences for understanding demographic processes and the properties of krill aggregations.																	0722-4060	1432-2056				MAR	2019	42	3					509	516		10.1007/s00300-018-02440-w							WOS:000459821700007

Changes in krill population viability would have catastrophic effect on the Antarctic ecosystem. One looming threat due to elevated levels of anthropogenic atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) is ocean acidification (lowering of sea water pH by CO2 dissolving into the oceans). The genetics of Antarctic krill has long been of scientific interest for both for the analysis of population structure and analysis of functional genetics. However, the genetic resources available for the species are relatively modest. We have developed the most advanced genetic database on Euphausia superba, KriIIDB, which includes comprehensive data sets of former and present transcriptome projects. In particular, we have built a de novo transcriptome assembly using more than 360 million Illumina sequence reads generated from larval krill including individuals subjected to different CO2 levels. The database gives access to: 1) the full list of assembled genes and transcripts; 2) their level of similarity to transcripts and proteins from other species; 3) the predicted protein domains contained within each transcript; 4) their predicted GO terms; 5) the level of expression of each transcript in the different larval stages and CO2 treatments. All references to external entities (sequences, domains, GO terms) are equipped with a link to the appropriate source database. Moreover, the software implements a full-text search engine that makes it possible to submit free-form queries. KriIIDB represents the first largescale attempt at classifying and annotating the full krill transcriptome. For this reason, we believe it will constitute a cornerstone of future approaches devoted to physiological and molecular study of this key species in the Southern Ocean food web.

JOURNAL OF GENETICS												Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) is a keystone species in the southern ocean ecosystem where it is the main consumer of phytoplankton and constitutes the main food item of many higher predators. Both food and predators are most abundant at the surface, thus krill hide in the depth of the ocean during the day and migrate to the upper layers at night, to feed at a time when the predatory risk is lowest. Although the functional significance of this diel vertical migration (DVM) is clear and its modulation by environmental factors has been described, the involvement of an endogenous circadian clock in this behaviour is as yet not fully resolved. We have analysed the circadian behaviour of Euphausia superba in a laboratory setting and here we present the first description of locomotor activity rhythms for this species. Our results are in agreement with the hypothesis that the circadian clock plays a key role in DVM. They also suggest that the interplay between food availability, social cues and the light:dark cycle acts as the predominant Zeitgeber for DVM in this species.

Modeling the spatial and temporal dynamics of foraging movements of humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) in the Western Antarctic Peninsula	MOVEMENT ECOLOGY												Background: A population of humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) spends the austral summer feeding on Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) along the Western Antarctic Peninsula (WAP). These whales acquire their annual energetic needs during an episodic feeding season in high latitude waters that must sustain long-distance migration and fasting on low-latitude breeding grounds. Antarctic krill are broadly distributed along the continental shelf and nearshore waters during the spring and early summer, and move closer to land during late summer and fall, where they overwinter under the protective and nutritional cover of sea ice. We apply a novel space-time utilization distribution method to test the hypothesis that humpback whale distribution reflects that of krill: spread broadly during summer with increasing proximity to shore and associated embayments during fall. Results: Humpback whales instrumented with satellite-linked positional telemetry tags (n = 5), show decreased home range size, amount of area used, and increased proximity to shore over the foraging season. Conclusions: This study applies a new method to model the movements of humpback whales in the WAP region throughout the feeding season, and presents a baseline for future observations of the seasonal changes in the movement patterns and foraging behavior of humpback whales (one of several krill-predators affected by climate-driven changes) in the WAP marine ecosystem. As the WAP continues to warm, it is prudent to understand the ecological relationships between sea-ice dependent krill and krill predators, as well as the interactions among recovering populations of krill predators that may be forced into competition for a shared food resource.																	2051-3933						2015	3								13	10.1186/s40462-015-0041-x							WOS:000215741800013	26034604					
J	Newman, SJ; Ritz, D; Nicol, S				Newman, SJ; Ritz, D; Nicol, S			Behavioural reactions of Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba Dana) to ultraviolet and photosynthetically active radiation	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY												We used broad, shallow and deep, narrow aquarium tanks to examine the behavioural responses of Antarctic krill to photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) and ultraviolet (UV) radiation. Groups of animals were exposed to different levels of radiation and to gradients of radiation and their mean position in the tanks were recorded photographically. Results from the horizontal tank (length 2.4 m) showed that krill moved from areas of high levels (7 W m(-2)) of UVA exposure (320-400 nm) to areas of low exposure (0.1 W m(-2)), differing in irradiance by two orders of magnitude. In addition, a similar reaction was observed in krill exposed to a PAR gradient of similar magnitude (30-5 W m(-2)). There was no observed reaction to UVB wavelengths (280-320 nm). Krill in the vertical tank (height 1.5 m) remained evenly distributed throughout the tank when exposed to both high and low levels of PAR. Additional exposure to UVA wavelengths from the surface caused krill to increase their depth in the tank significantly, to areas of lower irradiance. Addition of UVB radiation had no effect on the mean depth of krill in the tank. The implications of these findings are that krill may avoid regions of high UVA or PAR and consequently would reduce their exposure to UVB and therefore the risk of UVB-induced damage, such as disruption to DNA.

A separation of the stomach into an anterior part, called cardia, and a posterior part, called pylorus, became evident. Protrusions of the stomach into the midgut form the third region, called the funnel. The interior of the cardia is dominated by the two lateralia, originating from the side walls of the stomach. At their undersurface, they bear the primary filter. It separates the dorsal food channel from the ventral filtration channel, which is divided into two channels by a ventromedian ridge, the anteromedianum. Within the pylorus, the inferolateralia act in sealing the food channel from the filtration channel. In contrast to many other Malacostraca, the inferomedianum bears no secondary filter. During live observations, the stomach of Euphausia superba shows distinct pumping phases. A comparison of the structure of the stomach with data obtained from other Crustacea will lead to a better understanding about the relationships between the Malacostraca.

J	Ebina, Y; Miki, T				Ebina, Y; Miki, T			Range and biological significance of characteristic water currents produced by the shrimps Euphausia superba and Metapenaeus intermedius	ZOOLOGY-ANALYSIS OF COMPLEX SYSTEMS												Frequency spectra were calculated from video records of light reflecting particles within flow fields produced by Euphausia superba (antarctic krill), Crangon crangon, Metapenaeus intermedius and two abiotic sources. The experiments were made to test the hypothesis, that characteristic frequencies in the turbulent propulsion flow produced by swimming shrimp render this flow a communication signal among conspecifics. The range has been measured over which the specificity of the flow signal is preserved. In Euphausia superba the characteristic frequency was preserved over a distance more than 16 cm from the source. The shrimps Metapenaeus intermedius and Crangon crangon did not produce significant flow. The characteristic frequency was detectable only directly at the pleopods and not beyond 1.5 cm from the source. In contrast, Euphausia superba moves the swimmerets in a highly coordinated manner producing strong flow carrying a characteristic turbulence through a considerable distance. It results from the beat frequency of swimmerets and we suppose that it is useful in grouping individuals into schools and in the control of formation swimming.																	0944-2006						1996	99	3					163	174									WOS:A1996VW38800002

J	Mangel, M; Switzer, PV				Mangel, M; Switzer, PV			A model at the level of the foraging trip for the indirect effects of krill (Euphausia superba) fisheries on krill predators	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING												We present a model at the level of the foraging trip for the effects of a fishery on krill (Euphausia superba) predators, using the Adelie penguin (Pygoscelis adeliae) as a model organism. The model involves: (i) the description of the biomass and spatial distribution of krill; (ii) the effects of the fishery on the krill; (iii) the description of penguin breeding; and (iv) the indirect effects of the fishery on penguin reproduction and survival. The objective is to make relative comparisons of penguin reproductive success and adult survival in the absence or presence of a fishery. The biomass of krill appropriate for the predators (and the fishery) fluctuates from one year to the next according to an age-structured, stochastic recruitment model. Furthermore, there is a spatial-temporal structure, determined by diffusion and advection, to krill availability in relation to the location of the penguin breeding colony. Fishing is assumed to change the spatial and temporal distribution of available krill. After fledging, offspring survival depends in part upon the amount of krill delivered to them during the feeding periods. We use empirical data to estimate parental and offspring needs and a standard life history model to set the upper limits for survival. Parental survival after breeding depends upon the krill deficiency (relative to needs) that parents accumulate while feeding their young. A sensitivity analysis of the breeding model shows that the predictions are robust for parameters about which little is known, to the functional forms relating krill abundance to offspring and parent survival, and to the rules that parents use to allocate krill to their offspring. We evaluate expected reproductive success (offspring survival) and expected parental survival as functions of the amount of krill captured by the fishing fleet. Over the range of catch in our study, the reductions in reproductive success are essentially linear functions of krill catch with slope 1.5 and reductions in adult survival are also linear functions of krill catch, with but slopes less than 1. That is, reductions in reproductive success and parental survival are linear functions of krill catch, but not 1:1. The reductions in offspring and parent survival are mainly determined by how long the fishing season lasts and the capacity for harvest, rather than when fishing begins.

Krill (Euphausia superba) distribution contracts southward during rapid regional warming	NATURE CLIMATE CHANGE												High-latitude ecosystems are among the fastest warming on the planet(1). Polar species may be sensitive to warming and ice loss, but data are scarce and evidence is conflicting(2-4). Here, we show that, within their main population centre in the southwest Atlantic sector, the distribution of Euphausia superba (hereafter, 'krill') has contracted southward over the past 90 years. Near their northern limit, numerical densities have declined sharply and the population has become more concentrated towards the Antarctic shelves. A concomitant increase in mean body length reflects reduced recruitment of juvenile krill. We found evidence for environmental controls on recruitment, including a reduced density of juveniles following positive anomalies of the Southern Annular Mode. Such anomalies are associated with warm, windy and cloudy weather and reduced sea ice, all of which may hinder egg production and the survival of larval krill(5). However, the total post-larval density has declined less steeply than the density of recruits, suggesting that survival rates of older krill have increased. The changing distribution is already perturbing the krill-centred food web(6) and may affect biogeochemical cycling(7,8). Rapid climate change, with associated nonlinear adjustments in the roles of keystone species, poses challenges for the management of valuable polar ecosystems(3).

J	Frazer, TK; Ross, RM; Quetin, LB; Montoya, JP				Frazer, TK; Ross, RM; Quetin, LB; Montoya, JP			Turnover of carbon and nitrogen during growth of larval krill, Euphausia superba Dana: A stable isotope approach	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY												Using natural abundances of stable isotopes (delta(13)C and delta(15)N) as tracers, carbon and nitrogen turnover rates were determined for larval krill, Euphausia super ba Dana, maintained in the laboratory. Experimental populations of larvae were reared at +1.5 degrees C and -1.5 degrees C on foods of known isotopic composition and subsampled weekly (8-10 weeks) for a determination of wet weight and isotopic composition. Metabolic turnover of carbon and nitrogen, manifested as temporal shifts in delta(13)C and delta(15)N, was tied closely to temperature. Larval krill reared at +1.5 degrees C had replaced 22-29% of their original body carbon at the conclusion of the experiment, but only 13-22% of their original body nitrogen. Larvae reared at -1.5 degrees C exhibited little evidence of carbon turnover and replaced less than 6% of their original body nitrogen. These are the first simultaneous, coupled measurements of long-term carbon and nitrogen turnover for any marine animal, and provide an essential calibration for the interpretation of stable isotope ratios in animals collected from the field. In addition to the feeding experiments, animals were starved for 2 months at +1.5 degrees C and -1.5 degrees C. Starved krill exhibited little isotopic change. This finding suggests that starvation cannot account for large temporal variations observed in the isotopic composition of larval krill collected from the field. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.

J	Hofmann, EE; Lascara, CM				Hofmann, EE; Lascara, CM			Modeling the growth dynamics of Antarctic krill Euphausia superba	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												A time-dependent, size-structured, bioenergetically based model was developed to examine the growth dynamics of Antarctic krill Euphausia superba 2 to 60 mm in size. The metabolic processes included in the model are ingestion, a baseline respiration, respiratory losses due to feeding and digestion, and an activity-based respiration factor. The total of these processes, net production, was used as the basis for determining the growth or shrinkage of individuals. Size-dependent parameterizations for the metabolic processes were constructed from field and laboratory measurements. Environmental effects were included through time series of pelagic phytoplankton concentration that were derived from data sets collected west of the Antarctic Peninsula. Simulated growth rates during the spring and summer for all brill size classes were consistent with published growth rates; however, initial results indicated that winter shrinkage rates were too large. Although the use of a seasonally varying respiration activity factor (reduced winter respiration rates) resulted in winter shrinkage rates of adults that were consistent with observations of experimentally starved individuals, the annual change in length of specific size classes was still inconsistent with observations. Subsequent simulations examined the effect of ingestion of sea ice algae by krill in the late winter and early spring. The annual growth cycle best matched observations, particularly those for larval and subadult krill (<35 mm), when reduced winter respiration rates and ingestion of sea ice algae were both included. These results suggest that the ability of krill to exploit a range of food sources and reduced winter metabolism rates are the mechanisms that allow krill to successfully overwinter. The need for additional observations of krill physiological processes, especially during winter, is clearly indicated.																	0171-8630	1616-1599					2000	194						219	231		10.3354/meps194219							WOS:000086432600020						
J	Frazer, TK; Quetin, LB; Ross, RA				Frazer, TK; Quetin, LB; Ross, RA			Energetic demands of larval krill, Euphausia superba, in winter	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY												Metabolic rates of larval and juvenile krill, Euphausia superba, were measured on board ship during three winter cruises west of the Antarctic Peninsula (June-July 1987, June 1993, and June 1994), and also under different temperature regimes and feeding conditions during long-term maintenance in the laboratory (Palmer Station, winter 1993). A mean oxygen consumption and nitrogen excretion ratio of 31.1 measured on board ship at ambient ocean temperatures suggested that larval and juvenile krill from ice-covered waters were primarily herbivorous. Results from both shipboard and laboratory experiments demonstrated that oxygen consumption increased with temperature, but that larvae subjected to acute temperature increases exhibited higher rates. Experiments conducted at near ambient water temperatures for winter were also conducted to test the effect of habitat on the energy requirements of larval and juvenile krill. A comparison of the field and laboratory studies conducted at -1.5 to -1.8 degreesC showed that larvae from ice-covered waters and fed larvae in the laboratory had oxygen consumption rates significantly higher than those of larvae collected from open, i.e. ice-free, water and those starved in the laboratory. Results of the comparison lend support to the concept that in winter, larval and juvenile krill are better fed in ice-covered waters than in open water, and to the hypothesis that ice biota in the pack ice are an important food resource in winter for larval and juvenile krill.

Starvation increased the intermolt period in krill, but had no effect on the fluoride concentration of the molts produced. Addition of excess fluoride to the sea water had no direct effect on the intermolt period, the molt weight, or molt size. Additions of 6-mu-g 1(-1) and 10-mu-g 1(-1) fluoride raised the fluoride concentrations of the molts produced and of the whole animals. The whole body fluoride content varied cyclically during the molt cycle, reaching a peak 6 days following ecdysis. Fluoride loss at ecdysis could largely be explained by the amount of this ion shed in the molt.																	0278-0372					FEB	1991	11	1					10	16		10.2307/1548539							WOS:A1991EX28900002

All of the genome sequences were purified by gene amplification using long polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and the products were subsequently used as templates for either direct sequencing using a primer-walking strategy or nested PCR with crustacea-versatile primers. Although we were unable to determine a portion of the genome owing to technical difficulties, the sequenced position, 14,606 bp long, contained all of the 13 protein-coding genes, 19 of the 22 transfer RNA genes, and the large subunit as well as a portion of the small subunit ribosomal RNA genes.

On each individual, different measurements were taken, a differentiation index was calculated, and lipids and carotenoids analysed; the data were processed by principal component analysis (PCA). In Euphausia superba the analysis of six morphometric characteristics shows a separation into two groups for the males, but not for females. The analysis of a larger sample, using only four variables, shows an analogous, though less marked separation, suggesting a morphological evolution linked with age. When biochemical data were added, PCA shows a good separation into two groups for both males and females, and the same result was obtained using only the biochemical data and the differentiation index. No possible age groups, other than juveniles and adult males and females, could be identified by PCA for Thysanoessa macrura.																	0198-0149					JUL	1991	38	7					771	779		10.1016/0198-0149(91)90018-B							WOS:A1991GE93900002

The time-dependent location of particles, which represent krill individuals, is determined by random diffusion, foraging activity, and movement induced by the presence of neighbours. Foraging activity is based on prescribed food conditions and is such that krill swim slower and turn more frequently in areas of high food concentration. The presence or absence of neighbours either disperses krill, if the local concentrations become too dense, or coalesces krill, if concentrations become too dilute, respectively. Predation on krill is included and affects swarm characteristics by removing individuals. Sensitivity studies indicate that the rate of krill swarm formation and the total number of swarms formed are determined primarily by foraging response and nearest neighbour sensing distance. Simulations using food distributions that are representative of those encountered at boundaries, such as fronts, mesoscale eddies, or the sea ice edge, show that foraging activity can produce rapid swarm formation. Results from other krill swarm models show that attraction between individuals is the primary mechanism producing krill swarms. However, the parameterizations for krill interactions used in those models and that used in this model differ, thereby implying different biological dynamics. Thus, parameterization of the basic interactions it) krill swarm models remains to be defined. (C) 2004 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

E. superba shows daily and seasonal rhythms in physiology and behaviour, which are synchronized with the environmental cycles of its habitat. Recently, the main components of the krill circadian machinery have been identified and characterized. However, the exact mechanisms through which the endogenous timing system operates the control and regulation of the overt rhythms remains only partially understood. Here we investigate the involvement of the circadian clock in the temporal orchestration of gene expression by using a newly developed version of a krill microarray platform. The analysis of transcriptome data from krill exposed to both light-dark cycles (LD 18:6) and constant darkness (DD), has led to the identification of 1,564 putative clock-controlled genes. A remarkably large proportion of such genes, including several clock components (clock, period, cry2, vrille, and slimb), show oscillatory expression patterns in DD, with a periodicity shorter than 24 hours. Energy-storage pathways appear to be regulated by the endogenous clock in accordance with their ecological relevance in daily energy managing and overwintering. Our results provide the first representation of the krill circadian transcriptome under laboratory, free-running conditions.

The 4 yr covered by this study (1991-1992, 1993-1994, 1994-1995, and 1995-1996) were part of the seasonal time series of the Palmer Long-Term Ecological Research program. Chlorophyll a concentrations represented food quantity, and accessory photosynthetic pigments represented phytoplankton community composition or food quality. Instantaneous growth rates reflected the in situ nutritional history of the previous intermolt period. The response of krill to the food environment was seen on temporal scales of days to weeks. Percent growth per intermolt period (percentage growth IMP-1) varied significantly both within and between years, ranging from similar to 2 to 10% IMP-1. Percent growth IMP-1 increased with increasing chlorophyll a (Chl a), reaching a maximum of 9.3% IMP-1 above a critical concentration of about 3.5 mg m(-3). Maximum growth was reached in only 2 yr, 1991-1992 and 1995-1996. In a multiple regression analysis, total Chi a and prymnesiophyte-Chl a explained over 71% of the temporal variance in growth. In general, highest growth was found toward the end of diatom blooms and lowest during periods of low phytoplankton biomass or blooms dominated by cryptophytes and prymnesiophytes. The results of this study support the hypothesis that maximum growth rates are only possible during diatom blooms and that production in Antarctic krill is limited by both food quantity and quality.																	0024-3590					JAN	2000	45	1					31	43		10.4319/lo.2000.45.1.0031							WOS:000084949600004

It also acts as an ecosystem engineer, affecting carbon sequestration and recycling iron and nitrogen, and has increasing importance as a commercial product in the aquaculture and health industries. Here we describe the creation of a de novo assembled head transcriptome for E. superba. As an example of its potential as a molecular resource, we relate its exploitation in identifying and characterizing numerous genes related to the circadian clock in E. superba, including the major components of the central feedback loop.

The final assembly resulted in a total of 26,415 contigs, 39.8% of which were putatively annotated.

The distance between the estimated and observed distributions was measured with the Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic. Sample variability was determined using resampling techniques. The ability of linear functions (Models I and II), allometric and non-parametric methods to recover the observed distributions was evaluated within samples and exchanging parameters between samples. Linear and allometric models proved inadequate to recover the distribution, while the differences obtained with non-parametric methods fall within the bounds of sample variability, suggesting that a linear equation does not capture the relation between total and exopodit length. The use of a non-parametric regression is recommended to increase the sample size when estimating the distributions of prey lengths in the stomach contents of Antarctic penguins.																	0722-4060	1432-2056				MAY	2008	31	6					717	724		10.1007/s00300-008-0411-6							WOS:000255059200007

Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) exhibit positive phototaxis to white LED light	POLAR BIOLOGY												The use of light-emitting diodes (LEDs) is increasingly used in fishing gears and its application is known to trigger negative or positive phototaxis (i.e., swimming away or toward the light source, respectively) for some marine species. However, our understanding of how artificial light influences behavior is poorly understood for many species and most studies can be characterized as trial and error experiments. In this study, we tested whether exposure to white LED light could initiate a phototactic response in Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba). Trawl-caught krill were used in a controlled artificial light exposure experiment conducted onboard a vessel in the Southern Ocean. The experiment was conducted in chambers with dark and light zones in which krill could move freely. Results showed that krill displayed a significant positive phototaxis. Understanding this behavioral response is relevant to development of krill fishing technology to improve scientific sampling gear, improve harvest efficiency, and reduce potential unwanted bycatch.

J	Siegel, V				Siegel, V			Distribution and population dynamics of Euphausia superba: summary of recent findings	POLAR BIOLOGY												Antarctic krill, Euphausia superba, has been studied since the early 1920s including distribution, life cycle and behavioural biology. Quantitative aspects of distribution, biomass and demography were becoming more important since the late 1970s when a rapidly developing krill fishery started to exploit this unique resource. Since then, opinions have sometimes changed even on the appraisal of basic features such as small and large scale distribution or dispersion as well as on seasonal and interannual changes in biomass. Finally, the stability and size of the entire population had to be revised, which was believed to be relatively stable in a stable environment. Recent work has shown that the krill stocks are undergoing long-term changes and proximate and ultimate causes are still under discussion. Hence, it seems timely to review the current status of the discussion of sometime diverging interpretation of the results on krill distribution and stock dynamics for various spatial and temporal scales.																	0722-4060	1432-2056				DEC	2005	29	1					1	22		10.1007/s00300-005-0058-5							WOS:000233869100001

In order to study the effect of stress on solitary living we tethered krill to wooden skewers and measured heart rate both when they were held isolated from conspecifics and when they were held at normal schooling distances (similar to1 body length). Heart rate did not differ significantly with sex or body size. However, intermoult krill had a significantly lower heart rate than postmoult animals. When two individuals were held at schooling distance, with one slightly higher in the water column than the other, the heart rate of the higher individual slowed significantly (106-98 beats min(-1)), while that of the lower individual remained the same. We interpret these results to mean that krill living solitarily are stressed but will respond to neighbouring individuals by decreasing their metabolic rate and saving energy.

Various elements of krill biology have been brought together to provide concepts of how, this species interacts with its environment, but there have been few recent attempts to generate a generalized conceptual model of its life history In this article I present such a model, based art previous descriptions, observations, and recent data from the scientific literature. This model takes into account a range of findings on krill biology and on the relationships between Antarctic krill and its biotic and abiotic environment. Krill life history is thus viewed as all evolved product of interactions between the species and its environment. The model places particular emphasis oil the different forces that act on the larval and adult stages, and on the interaction between krill behavior, systems of ocean currents, and sea ice.																	0006-3568	1525-3244				FEB	2006	56	2					111	120		10.1641/0006-3568(2006)056[0111:KCASIE]2.0.CO;2							WOS:000235422800012

Immature and mature eugregarine gamont stages were found at all larval stages older than Calyptopis I stage. Eugregarine infection in 14.0% (N = 108) of the first feeding stage (Calyptopis I) suggested that krill larvae are at risk from being infected during physiological transition from non-feeding to feeding stages. Eugregarine prevalence and intensity of infection at the three calyptopis stages increased with stage/krill length. Statistical analysis showed that the intensity of C. pacifica infection also increased with host density. Thus, krill density is probably a key determinant of the intensity of infection. We found gamont stage eugregarines in the host hind-gut, blocking the passage of food. Eugregarine infections in larval krill may have a negative impact on digestion and absorption in the host digestive tract.

However, many of the length classes of krill can escape through commonly used commercial trawl mesh sizes. A vital component of the overall management of a fishery is to estimate the total fishing mortalityand quantify the mortality rate of individuals that escape from fishing gear. The methods for determining fishing mortality in krill are still poorly developed. We used a covered codend sampling technique followed by onboard observations made in holding tanks to monitor mortality rates of escaped krill. Haul duration, hydrological conditions, maximum fishing depth and catch composition all had no significant effect on mortality of krill escaping 16 mm mesh size nets, nor was any further mortality associated with the holding tank conditions. A non-parametric Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to model the relationship between mortality rates of escapees and time. There was a weak tendency, though not significant, for smaller individuals to suffer higher mortality than larger individuals. The mortality of krill escaping the trawl nets in our study was 4.4 +/- 4.4%, suggesting that krill are fairly tolerant of the capture-and-escape process in trawls.

Using carapace measurements to determine the sex of Antarctic krill, Euphausia superba	POLAR BIOLOGY												Krill (Euphausia superba) carapace measurements (length and width; mm) collected from plankton tows in the South Shetland Islands (SSI), Antarctica are used to test the generality of a common discriminant function developed to reconstruct krill length frequencies in Antarctic fur seal diets for the area surrounding South Georgia (SG). Total length and sex ratio of krill in the SSI were overestimated by 5.6 and 154%, respectively, when the SG allometric equations were applied to 3 years (2003-2005) of data. These errors arise and increase as a result of krill population dynamics, specifically recruitment that contributes large proportions of immature krill, misclassified as males by the SG discriminant function. We develop sex-specific regression models based on separate discriminant functions that provide significantly better discriminatory power. However, our analysis indicates that reconstructions of krill sex ratio and length composition in the ocean environment are less reliable in years when the ratio of immature to mature krill is high. For the SSI area, five out of 14 years (35.7%) surveyed (1992-2005) had proportions of immature to mature adult krill >= 0.50.																	0722-4060					FEB	2007	30	3					307	315		10.1007/s00300-006-0184-8							WOS:000244212700006

In this study. Antarctic krill chitin was extracted from defatted Antarctic krill shell, and its crystalline structure and thermal properties were characterized by employing Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. X-ray diffractometry, scanning electron microscopy, thermogravimetry, and differential scanning calorimetry. Results showed that Antarctic krill chitin corresponded to the apolymorph, and was composed of small, stable, and uniform microcrystals. The degree of N-deacetylation was 11.28 +/- 0.86%. The d-spacings of Antarctic krill chitin were 9.78 angstrom and 4.63 angstrom at (0 2 0) and (1 1 0) planes. The crystalline sizes were 6.07 nm and 5.16 nm at (0 2 0) and (1 1 0) planes, respectively. The activation energy of the polysaccharide chain decomposition was 123.35 kJ/mol and the glass transition (T-g) of Antarctic krill chitin was 164.96 degrees C. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Close coupling between ammonium uptake by phytoplankton and excretion by Antarctic krill, Euphausia superba	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART I-OCEANOGRAPHIC RESEARCH PAPERS												In this study we examined the hypothesis that, under conditions of replete macronutrients and iron in the Southern Ocean, phytoplankton abundance and specific N uptake rates are influenced strongly by the processes of grazing and NH4 regeneration. NH4 and NO3 uptake rates by marine phytoplankton were measured to the northeast and northwest of the island of South Georgia during January-February 1998. Mean specific uptake rate for NO3 (vNO(3)) was 0.0026 h(-1) (range 0.0013-0.0065 h(-1)) and for NH4 (vNH(4)) was 0.0097 h(-1) (0.0014-0.0376 h(-1)). vNH(4) was related positively with NH4 availability, which ranged from 0.1 to 1.5 mmol m(-3) within the upper mixed layer. Ambient NH4 concentrations and vNH(4) were both positively related to local krill biomass values, computed from mean values along acoustic transect segments within 2 km of the uptake measurement stations. These biomass values ranged from similar to 1 g krill fresh mass m(-2) in the northwest to >4 kg krill wet mass m(-2) in the northeast. In contrast to the variability found with NH4 concentrations and uptake rates, vNO(3) was more uniform across the sampling sites. Under these conditions, increasing NH4 concentration appeared to represent an additional N resource. However, high vNH(4) tended to be found for stations with lower phytoplankton standing stocks, across a total range of 0.24-20 mg chlorophyll a m(-3). These patterns suggest a coupling between phytoplankton biomass, vNH(4) and krill in this region of variable but high krill biomass. Locally high concentrations of krill in parts of the study area appeared to have two opposing effects. On the one hand they could graze down phytoplankton stocks, but on the other hand, their NH4 excretion supported enhanced uptake rates by the remaining, ungrazed cells. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Winter preconditioning determines feeding ecology of Euphausia superba in the Antarctic Peninsula	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												We examined the feeding ecology and lipid composition of Antarctic krill Euphausia superba around the northern Antarctic Peninsula from 2001 to 2012. We used lipid biomarkers to quantify feeding patterns and relate the variability in biomarkers to environmental conditions that structure the phytoplankton community. Fatty acid profiles varied among years, with some years dominated by lipids indicative of herbivory, while other years were indicative of greater omnivory. Principal component analysis of 60 fatty acids showed that 3 principal components (PCs) explained approximately 50% of the variability in fatty acid profiles. The first PC separated the fatty acid indicators along a herbivory-omnivory-carnivory gradient. Correlations between the gradient of herbivory and carnivory, as summarized by the first PC, were found with both winter sea ice extent (r = 0.55, p < 0.01) and with ENSO conditions the previous winter (r = 0.88, p < 0.001). These findings suggest that climatic conditions during the late winter precondition the pelagic ecosystem around the Antarctic Peninsula, impacting the trophic ecology of Antarctic krill the following summer.																	0171-8630	1616-1599				JAN 20	2015	519						89	101		10.3354/meps11082							WOS:000349093800007

A vessel-mounted acoustic Doppler current profiler (ADCP) and a calibrated EK-60 echo sounder were used to assess circulation patterns and krill distributions in the bay, and a multiple opening and closing net (with 333 mu m mesh) and environmental sensing system (MOCNESS) was used to collect live samples of mesozooplankton and krill for taxonomic composition analysis. The results from this field study complement a previous one that examined an anticyclonic bay-scale circulation of Antarctic krill. This super-aggregation of krill covered similar to 100 km(2), had a concentration of 1000s of individuals m(-2) and was associated with more than 306 humpback whales present in Wilhelmina Bay. Our results from the mesozooplankton study revealed that krill continuously conducted diel vertical migrations and formed aggregations in the inner bay, while the chlorophyll concentration at the surface decreased from 2.2 to 0.6 g C m(-2) due to the decrease of daylight, and zooplankton concentrations increased from 0.5 to 1.5 g C m(-2) probably from advective influx. Most zooplankton were distributed below 200 m while krill fed in the upper 150 m. The spatial and temporal correlations between krill and small-to medium-sized mesozooplankton imply that krill may become omnivorous when there is a lack of phytoplankton in the late austral fall. Though both phytoplankton and zooplankton biomasses contributed only small fractions of the daily ration needed for krill metabolism in Wilhelmina Bay, it is not clear what caused krill to aggregate on such a large scale, as this led to high mortality as a result of starvation and predation by whales and other top predators.

Experimental determination of reflectance spectra of Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) in the Scotia Sea	ANTARCTIC SCIENCE												Antarctic krill are the dominant metazoan in the Southern Ocean in terms of biomass; however, their wide and patchy distribution means that estimates of their biomass are still uncertain. Most currently employed methods do not sample the upper surface layers, yet historical records indicate that large surface swarms can change the water colour. Ocean colour satellites are able to measure the surface ocean synoptically and should theoretically provide a means for detecting and measuring surface krill swarms. Before we can assess the feasibility of remote detection, more must be known about the reflectance spectra of krill. Here, we measure the reflectance spectral signature of Antarctic krill collected in situ from the Scotia Sea and compare it to that of in situ water. Using a spectroradiometer, we measure a strong absorption feature between 500 and 550 nm, which corresponds to the pigment astaxanthin, and high reflectance in the 600-700 nm range due to the krill's red colouration. We find that the spectra of seawater containing krill is significantly different from seawater only. We conclude that it is tractable to detect high-density swarms of krill remotely using platforms such as optical satellites and unmanned aerial vehicles, and further steps to carry out ground-truthing campaigns are now warranted.

To address the knowledge gap, we conducted a 60-day feeding trial. At the end of the experiment (day 60), the cuttlefish Sepiella japonica eating Palaemon gravieri (SJP) grew significantly faster than those eating Euphausia superba (SJE), with the specific growth rate (SGR)(SJP) (7.92%) > (SGR)(SJE) (7.09%). Approximately 33.3% and 20.0% mortality was observed in the SJE and SJP, during the course of the experiment respectively. Some important fatty acids (i.e. n-3 and n-6 PUFAs) were elevated in SJE with respect to SJP. Replacement of Antarctic krill increased the diversity of the gut microbiome composition in the SJE group. Fluoride accumulated in the ink sac and cuttlebone of cuttlefish in SJE. Overall, these findings imply that PUFA-rich Antarctic krill could replace P. gravieri shrimp for feeding cuttlefish S. japonica.																	1355-557X	1365-2109				MAY	2020	51	5					1867	1879		10.1111/are.14537		FEB 2020					WOS:000512422900001

The protective effects of osmolytes on the thermal denaturation and aggregation of arginine kinase from E. superba (ESAK) was investigated. When the concentration of glycine, proline and glycerol increased, the relative activation was significantly enhanced, while the aggregation of ESAK during thermal denaturation was decreased. Spectrofluorometry results showed that the presence of these three osmolytes significantly decreased the tertiary structural changes of ESAK and that thermal denaturation directly induced ESAK aggregation. The results demonstrated that glycine, proline and glycerol not only prevented ESAK from inactivation and unfolding but also inhibited aggregation by stabilizing the ESAK conformation. We measured the ORF gene sequence of ESAK by RACE, and built the 3D structure of ESAK and osmolytes by homology models. The results showed that the docking energy was relatively low and that the clustering groups were spread to the surface of ESAK, indicating that osmolytes directly protect the surface of the protein. Our study provides important insight into the protective effects of osmolytes on ESAK folding. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Krafft, BA; Krag, LA				Krafft, Bjorn A.; Krag, Ludvig A.			Assessment of mortality of Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) escaping from a trawl	FISHERIES RESEARCH												The overall purpose of this study was to estimate the mortality of Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) that escape from the most common mesh size used for codends (16 mm) in the current commercial fishery. The experiment was carried out off the South Orkney Islands (60 degrees 35'S, 45 degrees 30'W) using a covered codend sampling technique for retaining escaped krill, which thereafter were observed in holding tanks to monitor their mortality rate. Our results suggest that krill with smaller body lengths suffered higher mortality. However, sampling depth, haul duration and catch accumulation as well as handling effects onboard, such as exposure to temperature differences, likely increased the mortality rates in our experiment. The results indicates that mortality of krill which escape trawl nets is relatively small, suggesting that krill, in common with many other crustacean species, are fairly tolerant to a process of capture-and-escape.

It was observed that krill were neither randomly nor evenly distributed within the swarms, particularly in larger swarms (extending for more than about 35 m along track), where there was significant evidence of krill concentration in the centre. Linear trends in density across swarms were also common. In swarms of intermediate size (15 to 35 m along track), these linear effects were predominantly negative, perhaps indicating reaction of the swarms to the approaching ship. Significant linear effects were present in the larger swarms as well, but in these, positive gradients were as common as negative ones. The effects of beam width on estimates of swarm density and internal structure made by echosounder are examined, and a method of correcting for these effects described. It was found that if no beam width correction is applied, artefacts are introduced into the apparent density structures, while the mean swarm density can be underestimated by as much as 50%.

One of them was purified to be homogeneous in disc electrophoresis. The amount of reducing sugars produced from laminaran with this enzyme reaction considerably exceeded the amount of liberated glucose. The enzyme hydrolyzed the periodate-oxidized and reduced laminaran. The enzyme also hydrolyzed laminarioligosaccharides except laminaribiose. However, the enzyme could not hydrolyze (1 --> 3)-beta-:(1 --> 4)-beta-D-glucan such as barley glucan and lichenan. These findings indicate that this enzyme belongs to the classes of (1 --> 3)-beta-D-glucan glucanohydrolase (EC 3.2.1.39). This enzyme hydrolyzed laminaritriose, but the enzymes classified to EC 3.2.1.39 were reported to have no ability to hydrolyze laminaritriose. Therefore, 1,3-beta-D-glucan glucanohydrolase isolated in this study has a new property in this respect.																	0021-5392					SEP	1992	58	9					1693	1698									WOS:A1992JT00500017

This study identified 75 microbial isolates from E. superba, that is 42 fungi and 33 bacteria including eight actinobacteria. And all the isolates showed NaF tolerance in conformity with the nature of the fluoride krill. The maximum concentration was 10%, 3% and 0.5% NaF for actinobacteria, bacteria and fungi, respectively. The results demonstrated that 82.4% bacteria, 81.3% actinobacteria and 12.3% fungi produced antibacterial metabolites against pathogenic bacteria without NaF; the MIC value reached to 3.9 mu g/mL. In addition, more than 60% fungi produced cytotoxic metabolites against A549, MCF-7 or K562 cell lines. The presence of NaF led to a reduction in the producing antimicrobial compounds, but stimulated the production of cytotoxic compounds. Furthermore, seven cytotoxic compounds were identified from the metabolites of Penicillium citrinum OUCMDZ4136 under 0.5% NaF, with the IC50 values of 3.6-13.1 mu M for MCF-7, 2.2-19.8 mu M for A549 and 5.4-15.4 mu M for K562, respectively. These results indicated that the krill microbes exert their chemical defense by producing cytotoxic compounds to the mammalians and antibacterial compounds to inhibiting the pathogenic bacteria.																	2045-2322					NOV 4	2016	6								36496	10.1038/srep36496							WOS:000387023600001	27812046

Available information supports the existence of an endogenous timing system in krill enabling it to synchronize metabolism and behavior with an environment characterized by extreme seasonal changes in terms of day length, food availability, and surface ice extent. A screening of our transcriptome database "KrillDB" allowed us to identify the putative orthologues of 20 circadian clock components. Mapping of conserved domains and phylogenetic analyses strongly supported annotations of the identified sequences. Luciferase assays and co-immunoprecipitation experiments allowed us to define the role of the main clock components. Our findings provide an overall picture of the molecular mechanisms underlying the functioning of the endogenous circadian clock in the Antarctic krill and shed light on their evolution throughout crustaceans speciation. Interestingly, the core clock machinery shows both mammalian and insect features that presumably contribute to an evolutionary strategy to cope with polar environment's challenges. Moreover, despite the extreme variability characterizing the Antarctic seasonal day length, the conserved light mediated degradation of the photoreceptor EsCRY1 suggests a persisting pivotal role of light as a Zeitgeber.

The used chemicals were NaOH, Na2CO3, Na2SO3, citric acid, acetic acid, phosphoric acid, HCl, ethanol, lysine, aminoguanidine, arginine, carnitine, betaine, and creatine. Fluoride contents per dry weight were 788 +/- 10mgkg1 in the whole body of krill (WBK) and 294 +/- 4mgkg1 in the peeled krill meat (PKM) respectively. When WBK was treated with chemicals with and without heating or thawed, fluoride was not decreased. On the other hand, when the PKM was treated with chemicals without heating was remarkably decreased to less than 100mgkg1, which is the criteria recommended by FDA. Particularly, the treatment of betaine without heating showed the best reduction effect of 30 +/- 6mgkg1, followed by carnitine (38 +/- 17mgkg1), acetic acid (52 +/- 1mgkg1), phosphoric acid (67 +/- 2mgkg1) and hydrochloric acid (68 +/- 1mgkg1).																	0950-5423					JUN	2013	48	6					1252	1259		10.1111/ijfs.12084							WOS:000318637500018

However, the nature and consequences of changes in krill population dynamics that accompany fluctuations in its abundance are essentially unknown. A conceptual model, developed from quantitative measures of krill length in the diet of predators at South Georgia from 1991 to 1997, allowed predictions to be made about the abundance and population structure of krill in 1998 and the consequences for predators. Consistent with model predictions, in 1998 there was a serial change in krill population structure, low krill biomass and low reproductive performance of predators. The change in the modal size of krill, from 56 mm in December to 42 mm in March, was apparently a result of the transport of krill into the region. This is the first occasion when the future status and structure of the krill population at South Georgia has been successfully predicted. By representing local krill population dynamics, which may also reflect large-scale physical and biological processes, predators have a potential key role as indicators of environmental variation in the Southern Ocean at a range of spatial scales.																	0025-3162					DEC	1999	135	4					647	652		10.1007/s002270050665							WOS:000084638000008

J	Cripps, GC; Atkinson, A				Cripps, GC; Atkinson, A			Fatty acid composition as an indicator of carnivory in Antarctic krill, Euphausia superba	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES					2nd International Symposium on Krill	AUG 23-27, 1999	UNIV CALIF SANTA CRUZ, SANTA CRUZ, CALIFORNIA		UNIV CALIF SANTA CRUZ			In a previous study at South Georgia, carnivory was invoked as a cause of high polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) content of Antarctic krill, Euphausia superba. To examine this, krill were sampled and fed for 16 days exclusively on the locally abundant copepod Drepanopus forcipatus. After 16 days, the krill had increased their PUFA content from 28 to 54% of the total fatty acids. Concurrently, monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs) and saturated fatty acids (SFAs) decreased from 41 to 27%. Thus, the krill appeared to accumulate PUFAs as reflected in their diet of D. forcipatus, which also had a relatively high PUFA content (50%). Overall, the results support omnivorous feeding by krill at South Georgia during nonbloom periods. We propose that the ratio of PUFA to SFA content may be used to detect carnivory in the recent feeding history of krill and suggest that this may be an index which could be applied to other zooplankton.																	0706-652X						2000	57			3			31	37		10.1139/cjfas-57-S3-31							WOS:000166531600005						
J	Maas, A; Waloszek, D				Maas, A; Waloszek, D			Larval development of Euphausia superba Dana, 1852 and a phylogenetic analysis of the Euphausiacea	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Literature data and new investigations by SEM of selected ontogenetic stages of the Antarctic Krill, Euphausia superba Dana, 1852 revealed morphological characters that are either missing in, or significantly changed towards, the adult. Besides adult features, such ontogenetic characters enabled us to propose a hypothesis of the phylogenetic relationships of and within the Euphausiacea on the basis of a computer aided cladistic analysis. These are of the form (Bentheuphausia amblyops + Euphausiidae = (' Thysanopoda' + Nematobrachion + Euphausiinae = (Meganyctiphanes norvegica + Euphausiini, new name + Nematoscelini, new name = ( Nyctiphanes + Nematoscelina, new name)))). From this analysis the taxon names 'Euphausiina', 'Nematoscelini', and 'Nematoscelina' are introduced for in-groups of the taxon Euphausiacea as representing monophyletic units. The position of a set of ontogenetic characters remains relatively uncertain due to the still unknown larval development of Bentheuphausia amblyops (G. O. Sars, 1883).																	0018-8158					APR	2001	448	1-3					143	169		10.1023/A:1017549321961							WOS:000169863400014

The study was carried out in order to map the species of the choline-containing phospholipid classes: phosphatidylcholine and lyso-phosphatidylcholine. In addition, the prevalent phosphatidylcholine class was quantified and the results compared with prior analysis. The qualification was performed with separation on a reverse phase chromatography column, while the quantification was obtained with class separation on a normal phase chromatography column. An Orbitrap system was used for the detection, and pulsed-Q dissociation fragmentation was utilized for the identification of the species. An asymmetrical exclusion list was applied for detection of phospholipid species of lower concentration, significantly improving the number of species observed. A total of 69 choline-containing phospholipids were detected, whereof 60 phosphatidylcholine substances, among others seven with probable omega-3 fatty acids in both sn-1 and sn-2. The phosphatidylcholine concentration was estimated to be 34 +/- A 5 g/100 g oil (n = 5). These results confirm the complexity of the phospholipid composition of krill oil, and the presence of long chained, heavily unsaturated fatty acids.

J	Atkinson, A; Whitehouse, MJ				Atkinson, A; Whitehouse, MJ			Ammonium excretion by Antarctic krill Euphausia superba at South Georgia	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Excretion by Antarctic krill Euphausia superba (hereafter "krill") is measured typically in small containers of filtered seawater for 12-24 h, which may cause a reduction of swimming, feeding, and metabolism. if the maximum published excretion rates are realistic, krill would be a major source of regenerated nitrogen in the South Georgia area because of their high biomass there. Because literature values are variable, depending on season, feeding history and the experimental set-up, our aim was to measure both a mean and an upper value of krill excretion rate at South Georgia. Experiments were on juvenile krill during October-November 1997 and January 1998. Freshly caught animals excreted 1.6-2.8 nmol ammonium mg(-1) dry mass h(-1); within the fivefold range of summer literature values for equivalent-sized krill. Maximum rates were determined on acclimated krill in large containers during alternating 1-d periods with and without food. During the feeding periods in saturating food concentrations, the mean daily ration was similar to 32% of body carbon d(-1) and excretion was 210% (October-November) and 280% (January) of the values for freshly caught krill. This equates to a maximum loss of similar to 2% of body nitrogen d(-1). Excretion rates decreased during the 1-d periods without food, and rates during the feeding periods were similar to 30% higher than in those without food. This suggests that the lack of feeding in traditional experiments leads to roughly 30% underestimates of excretion rate. These results help to set some limits on ammonium production rates of South Georgia krill over regional scales. Our calculations suggest that the role of krill, in this varies between habitats to the west of the island (insignificant) and those in the east (significant).																	0024-3590					JAN	2000	45	1					55	63		10.4319/lo.2000.45.1.0055							WOS:000084949600006

Using supercritical carbon dioxide (SC-CO2) extraction with optimal extractions conditions of 45 A degrees C, 25MPa, and CO2 flow rate of 22 g/min, most of the neutral lipids were extracted. PC, PE and PI were then extracted in a second step conducted with modified existing method using ethanol, hexane and acetone as solvents. The major PL of krill residues was quantified by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC-ELSD). The fatty acid compositions of total PL, PC, PE and PI were analyzed by gas chromatography (GC). A significant amount of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) was present in both total and PLs fractions. The purified PLs were characterized by their acid value, peroxide value, and the oxidative stability. The purity of PL ranged between 93 and 97% and was evaluated by spectrophotometry.

J	QUETIN, LB; ROSS, RM				QUETIN, LB; ROSS, RM			BEHAVIORAL AND PHYSIOLOGICAL-CHARACTERISTICS OF THE ANTARCTIC KRILL, EUPHAUSIA-SUPERBA	AMERICAN ZOOLOGIST												The antarctic krill, Euphausia superba, is considered a success in the intensely seasonal environment of the Southern Ocean because of its abundance and central role as an important food item for many of the larger carnivores in the ecosystem. The behavioral and physiological characteristics that foster this success are: (1) the ability to find concentrations of food in several types of habitat and efficiently exploit whatever food is available; (2) the close correspondence of the life cycle with seasonal cycles of food availability; and (3) a combination of physiological mechanisms that enable krill to survive the long winter period of low food availability. We evaluated the relative importance of the following four major winter-over mechanisms that have been proposed for adult krill west of the Antarctic Peninsula. The three-fold reduction in metabolic rate is the most important winter-over mechanism for these adults, although lipid utilization and shrinkage also help satisfy energy requirements in the winter. Alternate food sources did not appear to contribute significantly as a winter energy source. However, the extent, predictability and complexity of the ice cover in a region during winter may have a great influence on the relative importance of these winter-over mechanisms for different populations. Ice cover in the waters west of the Antarctic Peninsula is unpredictable and smooth surfaced when it occurs, providing the krill with little refuge from predation. In multi-year pack ice of the Weddell Sea, however, ice cover is predictable and extensive, and there is a complex undersurface that provides hiding places. In this multi-year ice, adult krill have been observed under the ice feeding, whereas west of the Antarctic Peninsula most adult krill are in the water column in the winter and are not feeding. The balance between acquiring energy and avoiding predation may be different in these two regions in the winter because of differences in predictability and complexity of the ice cover.																	0003-1569						1991	31	1					49	63									WOS:A1991FD12300005						
J	Watkins, JL; Murray, AWA				Watkins, JL; Murray, AWA			Layers of Antarctic krill, Euphausia superba: are they just long krill swarms?	MARINE BIOLOGY												Antarctic krill, Euphausia superba Dana, a major component in the southern ocean food web, typically occur in aggregations that range from small? discrete swarms and schools through to layers and superswarms that extend horizontally for several kilometres. A large Longhurst-Hardy plankton recorder has been used to obtain high-resolution serial samples from within two layers (up to 4 km in length) that were found near Elephant Island, north of the Antarctic Peninsula. Krill length, sex and maturity stage, net and acoustic estimates of number density are shown to vary significantly within these large layers. The variation occurring within a single layer is comparable with that occurring in a set of 38 swarms sampled contemporaneously with the layers. Thus, unlike a krill swarm, a whole krill layer may account for a substantial amount of the variation in the local krill population? although individual pal-ts of the layer cannot be considered in this way. The layers play an important role in the ecology of the krill within the area. Firstly, these large layers may contain a significant proportion of the biomass within an area. Secondly, the structure of the layers gives some insight into the ways in which krill swarm formation and dispersal may be occurring.																	0025-3162					MAY	1998	131	2					237	247		10.1007/s002270050316							WOS:000074174600005

Krill were exposed to light-cycle regimes of variable intensity to simulate Southern Ocean summer, autumn, and winter conditions, respectively, using: (1) continuous light (LL; 200 lux max), (2) 12-h light and 12-h darkness (LD 12 : 12; 50 lux max), and (3) continuous darkness (DD). In all experimental groups, the food concentration was kept at high levels (similar to 800 mu g C L-1). Krill exposed to LL and LD 12 : 12 showed an increase in all measured parameters over the experimental period. Physiological parameters of krill held under LD 12 : 12 showed a more consistent increase and remained below those of krill held under LL. No change was recorded for krill exposed to DD; clearance rates and daily C rations did not respond to the high food availability, and oxygen consumption rates and MDH activity were significantly lower (p < 0.05) than those of krill exposed to summer light condition. Thus, changes in the environmental light regime have an important effect on physiological parameters of krill, such as feeding and metabolic rates, and may indicate an inherent overwinter adaptation strategy triggered by the Antarctic light regime.

Growth and shrinkage in Antarctic krill Euphausia superba is sex-dependent	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												The ability of Antarctic krill Euphausia superba Dana to withstand the overwintering period is critical to their success. Laboratory evidence suggests that krill may shrink in body length during this time in response to the low availability of food. Nevertheless, verification that krill can shrink in the natural environment is lacking because winter data are difficult to obtain. One of the few sources of winter krill population data is from commercial vessels. We examined length-frequency data of adult krill (> 35 mm total body length) obtained from commercial vessels in the Scotia-Weddell region and compared our results with those obtained from a combination of science and commercial sampling operations carried out in this region at other times of the year. Our analyses revealed body-length shrinkage in adult females but not males during winter, based on both the tracking of modal size classes over seasons and sex-ratio patterns. Other explanatory factors, such as differential mortality, immigration and emigration, could not explain the observed differences. The same pattern was also observed at South Georgia and in the Western Antarctic Peninsula. Fitted seasonally modulated von Bertalanffy growth functions predicted a pattern of overwintering shrinkage in all body-length classes of females, but only stagnation in growth in males. This shrinkage most likely reflects morphometric changes resulting from the contraction of the ovaries and is not necessarily an outcome of winter hardship. The sex-dependent changes that we observed need to be incorporated into life cycle and population dynamic models of this species, particularly those used in managing the fishery.

Under laboratory conditions, larvae were starved for 0, 5, 10, 15, 20 and 25 days, and their R-cells were investigated by transmission electron microscope. R-cells are thought to play a role in the storage and absorption of nutrients. In fed larvae, numerous mitochondria scattered homogenously, and densely packed microvilli were observed on the apical surface of R-cells. After 5 days of starvation, mitochondria were swollen and were found concentrated in the apical region in R-cells. A decrease in cell volume and an increase in thickness of the basal lamina with many irregular infoldings were observed after 10-15 days of starvation. Lipid droplets were rarely found in the R-cells regardless of whether larvae had been fed or starved suggesting an inability to store lipid. Without the ability to store energy in the form of lipid, survival would be dependant on sourcing continuous food until maturation.

However, its application as a dietary supplement is limited, because of its rapid deterioration. Thus, this study aims to investigate the oxidative stability of krill oil extracted from Euphausia superba. Under optimal conditions (enzyme concentration 0.16%, enzymolysis time 2.9 h, and enzymolysis temperature of 45 degrees C) designed by response surface methodology, the extraction yield of krill oil is 86.02%. Five assays, including peroxide value (POV), thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS), pH value, and turbidity were used to determine the oxidative stability of krill oil nanoliposomes during storage. Carboxymethyl chitosan (CMCS) nanoliposomes showed a significant reduction in POV and TBARS values, a prevention of pH value decrease and turbidity increase. This study indicated that CMCS nanoliposome can effectively improve the oxidative stability of krill oil during storage. Furthermore, the release profile in vitro illustrated that the controlled release of krill oil carried out by CMCS nanoliposomes is feasible.																		1660-3397				FEB	2020	18	2							82	10.3390/md18020082							WOS:000518664600013	32012678

In the current study, the in vivo effects of Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) oil (AKO) on dexamethasone-treated mice were investigated. Results showed that AKO significantly prevents bone loss, as evidenced by improved bone mineral density, biomechanical strength, and cancellous bone microstructure. Fluorescence double-labeling of femur showed that AKO induces new bone formation. Toluidine blue staining of marrow cavity indicated that AKO increases the number of trabecula, and decreases the generation of adipose cells. Runt-related transcription factor 2 (Runx2) and Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) are the switches for osteogenic and adipogenic differentiation of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells, respectively. AKO significantly promoted the expression of Runx2 protein, and reduced PPAR expression in bone tissue. Furthermore, AKO increased the mRNA expression of osteogenesis-related genes and decreased the expression of adipogenesis-related genes. In conclusion, AKO improved glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis via promoting bone formation.																	1226-7708	2092-6456				APR	2019	28	2					539	545		10.1007/s10068-018-0463-5							WOS:000462163300026	30956866

The present work aimed to explore the effects of chitosan coating combined with sodium phytate (0.1% sodium phytate + 1% chitosan) on preserving Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) during partially frozen storage. Treatment of chitosan coating combined with sodium phytate significantly suppressed microbial growth, the increases in pH value, total volatile basic nitrogen and sensory deterioration of Antarctic krill (E. superba) during partially frozen storage. Therefore, chitosan coating combined with sodium phytate may be a practical method to suppress quality deterioration of Antarctic krill and thus extend its shelf life. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

J	Auerswald, L; Freier, U; Lopata, A; Meyer, B				Auerswald, Lutz; Freier, Ulrich; Lopata, Andreas; Meyer, Bettina			Physiological and morphological colour change in Antarctic krill, Euphausia superba: a field study in the Lazarev Sea	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY												Antarctic krill, Euphausia superba, is very susceptible to harmful solar radiation because of its unique genetic setup. Exposure occurs in spring to autumn during vertical diel migration and during occasional daytime surface-swarming. We have investigated colour change in Antarctic krill, Euphausia superba, during summer and winter in the Lazarev Sea in response to ultraviolet radiation (UVR) and photosynthetically active radiation (PAR). Short-term physiological colour change and long-term (seasonal) morphological colour change are present. Both are facilitated by a single type of monochromatic red chromatophore, i.e. erythrophores, of 20-450 mu m diameter. Superficial erythrophores cover large dorsal areas, especially above vital organs (brain, sinus glands), additional 'profound' erythrophores cover internal organs (heart, gut, nerve cords). Short-term change in light regime causes rapid physiological colour change along dense bundles of microtubules: pigment disperses into chromorhizae upon exposure to PAR and UVA and to a lesser extent to UVB. Darkness leads to aggregation of pigment in the centre and hence blanching. There is no circadian rhythm in the dispersal state of erythrophores present in winter. Physiological colour change in adult krill is two to three times more rapid in summer than in winter. Furthermore, seasonal changes in light regime also result in a profound morphological colour change: in summer animals, abdominal astaxanthin concentration is 450% and erythrophore count is 250-480% higher than in winter krill. We conclude from our results, that pigmentation of E. superba serves in the protection from harmful solar radiation and is adapted to the varying diel and seasonal light conditions.

Spatial and temporal variability in the structure of aggregations of Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) around South Georgia, 1997-1999	ICES JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE												Antarctic krill are important in the South Georgia (548 degrees S 358 degrees W) marine ecosystem. They form aggregations that vary widely in packing density (<1 to 1000 s of individuals m(-3)), length (tens to thousands of metres), and height (tens of metres). Acoustic surveys are often used to estimate krill biomass and provide data that give insight into aggregation structure. Using dual-frequency (38 and 120 kHz) acoustic data collected during six surveys conducted around South Georgia during the 1997, 1998, and 1999 austral summers, we isolated 2990 aggregations by applying the Shoal Analysis and Patch Estimation System algorithm in Echoview and a krill-length-dependent acoustic identifier (Delta Sv120-38). Multivariate cluster (partition) analysis was applied to metrics from each of the aggregations, resulting in three aggregation types with an overall proportional split of 0.28 : 0.28 : 0.44. Types 1 and 3 had low mean densities (<2 g m(-3)), whereas Type 2 had a mean density of 94 g m(-3). Intersurvey differences were found between the effort-corrected numbers of aggregation types (p 2.5e(-6)), and between on-and off-continental shelf areas (p = 1.5e(-7)), with a greater number of Type 2 aggregations being found on-shelf. The findings suggest intersurvey variation in krill catchability, with krill being more likely to be caught on-shelf.

Data were obtained relating to spawning depth and to extents to which larval stages co-occur and vary in depth through the season. Reproductive adults occurred at all depths sampled in late December in Bransfield Strait and in all but one stratum in late January to a depth of 2000 m in Drake Passage. Mature males were caught together with gravid females and freely sinking eggs down to at least 1000 m in Drake Passage and to more than 500 m in Bransfield Strait, providing indirect evidence that spawning can take place over extensive ranges of depth. In the 300-400 m deep Gerlache Strait, where larvae were particularly numerous (January to March), only a few reproductive adults were caught, and only in December at 100-200 m. Sampling methods were clearly inappropriate for quantitative estimates of adults.

It is not exactly known whether the scarcity of food or an internal clock, set by the natural Antarctic light regime, are responsible for non-feeding. Our research questions were therefore the following: (1) How will physiological and biochemical conditions of krill change during long-term starvation at constant light regime? (2) If and how do enzyme activities change during such starvation? (3) What is the influence of food availability versus that of light regime? To answer these questions, adult krill were starved under laboratory conditions for 12 weeks with constant light regime (12:12; dark/light) and the impact on physiological functions was studied. Initial experimental condition of krill resembled the condition of late spring krill in the field with fully active metabolism and low lipid reserves. Metabolic activity and activities of enzymes catabolising lipids decreased after the onset of starvation and remained low throughout, whereas lipid reserves declined and lipid composition changed. Mass and size of krill decreased while the inter-moult period increased. Depletion of storage- and structural metabolites occurred in the order of depot lipids and glycogen reserves after onset of starvation until proteins were almost exclusively used after 6-7 weeks of starvation. Results confirmed various proposed overwintering mechanisms such as metabolic slowdown, slow growth or shrinkage and use of lipid reserves. However, these changes were set in motion by food shortage only, i.e. without the trigger of a changing light regime.

Fecundity estimates were determined based on counts of mature oocytes in the ovary of females in preserved field samples. Principal components analysis and allometry were used to analyze the covariation of egg-batch size with female characteristics. In both krill species, egg-batch size scaled isometrically with ovarian weight but showed a positive allometry with body size. Predicted egg-batch size ranged from 200 to 4000 eggs for M. norvegica of 25.5-35 mm body length and from 1500 to 6000 eggs for E. superba of 36-55 mm. Allometric relationships can be used to predict annual fecundity from size structure data of krill populations. In this study, the effect of temperature on the duration of molting and spawning cycles was used to infer a number of reproductive cycles per year. taking into account climate and seasonal variation.																	0706-652X						2000	57			3			6	15		10.1139/cjfas-57-S3-6							WOS:000166531600002

There have been no reports on the miRNAs of the Antarctic krill Euphausia superba despite the specie's crucial position in Antarctic food webs. Two small RNA libraries were constructed from eyestalk and muscle, subsequently, and deep sequencing analysis was performed to investigate and profile E. superba miRNAs. A total of 19 304 586 and 23 005 104 unique sequences were obtained from the eyestalk and muscle, respectively. After compared the small RNA sequences with the Rfam database, 12 342 039 and 7 907 477 reads in eyestalk and muscle were matched to the transcriptome sequence of E. superba. A total of 236 distinct miRNAs were identified after annotation to known animal miRNAs registered in miRBase 21. In both libraries, the most abundant known miRNA were miR-750 with 92 583 reads in muscle and miR-1304-3p with 56 386 reads in eyestalk while the average value was less than 106, revealing a wide range of different expression levels. In addition, niR-277a enriched in both libraries and may be involved in modulating Krebs cycle by targeting to Vimar. Differential expression analysis showed that 56 mature miRNAs were significantly up/down regulated according to expression fold change. It appeared that the expression of several abundant miRNAs maybe tissue-specific or tissue-bias. Notably, the expression pattern of miR-750 and miR-1 family, which was suggested as the crucial candidates, involved in muscle development. Taken together, this study provides the first miRNA profile of E. superba and some of these miRNAs were expected to play important role in immune response, reproduction, energy metabolism, and muscle development and so on. Thus, the results provides a reference for functional studies of miRNAs in E. superba.																	2096-5508					NOV	2018	36	6			SI		2278	2287		10.1007/s00343-019-7229-7							WOS:000454629000030

LAGRANGIAN CALCULATIONS	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART A-OCEANOGRAPHIC RESEARCH PAPERS												A three-dimensional time-dependent model of the circulation in the Bransfield Strait-South Shetland Islands region and a physiologically-based, temperature-dependent model of the descent-ascent behavior of the embryos and larvae of Euphausia superba were combined in a Lagrangian particle tracing model to simulate trajectories of krill embryos and larvae. The Lagrangian calculations show that: (1) surface flow is the primary factor influencing the final location of the embryo-larva particle: and (2) timing of krill spawning affects the eventual position of the feeding larvae. Seasonal changes in the wind stress field result in variability in direction and velocity of surface currents, which affects the embryo-larva trajectories. Conditions favourable for the transport of larvae to Bransfield Strait occur early in the spawning season. East of the Antarctic Peninsula larvae have a greater probability of entering Bransfield Strait if the krill embryos are released in mid-summer, January to February. Embryos released to the north of the South Shetland Islands. west of 62-degrees-W are transported into Drake Passage. Embryos released to the north of the South Shetland Islands and east of Livingston Island are transported westward where they can eventually enter Bransfield Strait. Krill larvae also are transported into Bransfield Strait from the Bellingshausen and Weddell Seas. The Lagrangian trajectories show that the western Bransfield Strait is a region of potentially high larval concentration due to transport from surrounding areas as well as local production. This is in agreement with observed krill larvae distributions, which show higher concentrations in this region.																	0198-0149					JUL-AUG	1992	39	7-8A					1201	1220		10.1016/0198-0149(92)90064-Z							WOS:A1992JH54000009

Eugregarines were observed to accumulate in the front section of the gut at any host maturity stage. The results of statistical analysis showed that eugregarines at immediately pre-molt stage of the krill decreased significantly in the posterior of the hind-gut, and increased in the anterior of the hind-gut. Thus, the krill's molt stage may be one factor affecting the spatial distribution of eugregarines. As a strategy for avoiding discharge to the outer environment by molting, eugregarines may move to a safety zone (mid-gut).

There was no significant change in any biometric index (dry weight vs length, carbon vs dry weight, nitrogen vs dry weight, or body C:N). Rates of ammonium excretion in winter were not significantly different from those previously reported for E. superba in summer. It was clear that E. superba fed as a carnivore in winter. Copepod body parts consistently occurred in krill guts. During winter shipboard experiments, freshly caught krill ingested copepods and produced faeces at rates comparable to those measured in summer. The low ratio of N:P excretion (2.02) also suggests carnivorous feeding. A physiological model of carbon and nitrogen metabolism indicates that E. superba must feed during winter to maintain its observed C:N ratio and rate of ammonium excretion. On a diet of less than 1 Metridia gerlachei female copepod per day, a 20 mm krill can grow with a growth efficiency comparable to that achieved in summer. We suggest that starvation, body shrinkage and reduced metabolism are unusual behaviors for krill in winter, and that carnivory sustains growth until ice algae become available as food in late winter and early spring.																	0171-8630					APR	1994	107	1-2					23	40		10.3354/meps107023							WOS:A1994NH21600003

Seasonal and spatial influences on gene expression in Antarctic krill Euphausia superba	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												The high latitudes inhabited by Antarctic krill Euphausia superba Dana are characterised by extreme changes in seasonal conditions, with very low food availability, long periods of darkness and a massive expansion of sea ice in autumn and winter. How krill adapt to these conditions has yet to be determined, and it was the purpose of this study to gain more insight by investigating the differences between summer and winter krill populations at the molecular level. To achieve this, we used a cDNA microarray to compare gene expression between female adult krill caught during summer and winter near the Antarctic Peninsula (60 degrees S), and between Peninsula krill and krill caught near South Georgia (54 degrees S) during the same winter. The Peninsula seasonal comparison showed up-regulation in summer krill of genes involved in feeding and digestion, respiration, motor activity and immunity. Summer krill also showed evidence of increased vitellogenesis, with an insulin-related peptide up-regulated and neuroparsin down-regulated. The comparison between the different overwintering locations showed an up-regulation in the South Georgia krill of genes involved in feeding and digestion, and immunity. There was, however, no differential expression of genes involved in respiration, motor activity or vitellogenesis, suggesting that despite the above differences, both populations of overwintering krill were in a quiescent state. This study shows how krill physiology changes seasonally at the molecular level and how these changes are flexible according to the overwintering environment.

Sea ice extent has been implicated as a major factor affecting reproductive success of krill and krill dispersal, but little is known of the way in which ice cover may influence krill behaviour. This is largely because the under-ice environment is difficult to study. Ship-borne echosounders have, however, detected krill aggregations in midwater in ice-covered regions. We used 120-kHz echograms collected underway during three cruises that crossed ice-covered and adjacent open waters in the Bellingshausen, Weddell, and Scotia seas to compare morphological and next-neighbour characteristics of krill swarms within and without ice cover. No significant differences were detected between the horizontal and vertical extent of swarms or swarm next-neighbour distance in ice-covered or open waters. Distributions of swarm mid-depths did, however, differ significantly between ice-covered and open areas in all three seas, although the direction of difference was not the same in each instance: swarms in the Weddell and Scotia seas were generally shallower under ice than in open water, whereas in the Bellingshausen Sea the opposite prevailed.

TIME AND TEMPERATURE-DEPENDENCE DURING THE DESCENT ASCENT CYCLE	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART A-OCEANOGRAPHIC RESEARCH PAPERS												A time- and temperature-dependent model was developed to simulate the descent-ascent behavior of the embryos and early larval stages of the Antarctic krill, Euphausia superba. This model combines laboratory measurements of temperature effects on developmental times, density and physiology of krill embryos and larvae and the observed water temperature structure in the Bransfield Strait-South Shetland Islands region. Simulations with observed vertical temperature profiles from this region show that embryos that develop at temperatures less than 0-degrees-C hatch relatively deep (almost-equal-to 1000 m) or hit the bottom before hatching. The presence of warm (1-2-degrees-C) Circumpolar Deep Water (CDW), between 200 and 700 m, results in hatching depths of about 700 m. The sinking rate pattern characteristic of the embryos of Euphausia superba retains the embryos in the CDW, where development is accelerated. Larval ascent rate through the CDW is rapid, so larvae reach the surface before metamorphosing into the first feeding stage, and have sufficient carbon reserves to drift at the surface for several weeks before needing to find food. These results suggest that the sinking rate pattern characteristic of embryos of Antarctic krill may be part of a reproductive strategy that evolved in response to the thermal structure of its environment. The complementary component of this reproductive strategy is the observed correlation between the distribution of krill schools containing reproducing individuals and the presence of CDW. With this reproductive strategy, the spawning regions of Antarctic krill are in areas where oceanic conditions enhance the probability of survival of its embryos and non-feeding larvae.																	0198-0149					JUL-AUG	1992	39	7-8A					1177	1200		10.1016/0198-0149(92)90063-Y							WOS:A1992JH54000008

Size selection of Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) in a commercial codend and trawl body	FISHERIES RESEARCH												During fishing, many fish species are able to avoid the net walls of the trawl body and so the majority of size selection occurs in the codend of the net. Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) are regarded as true planktonic organisms passively drifting with currents, but they also display self-locomotion by active swimming. There is a lack of knowledge regarding the behavior of krill during the fishing process, and extrapolating results obtained for other species to krill is of limited value. In the case of krill, it is largely unknown to what extent the codend versus the trawl body contributes to the size selection process. The current study aims to quantify the size selection of krill in a commercially applied codend during experimental fishing. Combining these results with a model for full trawl size selectivity it was possible to provide an insight to the size selection process in the trawl body. Specifically, the study applied a two-step approach by first estimating the size selectivity of a commercial codend and second used the codend size selectivity obtained in this study to estimate the trawl body size selectivity of a commercial trawl based on entire trawl-selectivity obtained in a previous study. The results of this two-step analysis revealed that the trawl body contributes significantly to the total size selection process, demonstrating that size selectivity of Antarctic krill in commercial trawls is affected by both the trawl body and the codend.

The uptake and depuration kinetics of ingested microplastics for many marine species still remain unknown despite its importance for understanding bioaccumulation potential to higher trophic level consumers. In this study, Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) were exposed to polyethylene microplastics to quantify acute toxicity and ingestion kinetics, providing insight into the bioaccumulation potential of micro plastics at the first-order consumer level. In the 10 day acute toxicity assay, no mortality or dose-dependent weight loss occurred in exposed krill, at any of the exposure concentrations (0, 10, 20, 40, or 80% plastic diet). Krill exposed to a 20% plastic diet for 24 h displayed fast uptake (22 ng mg(-1) h(-1)) and depuration (0.22 h(-1)) rates, but plastic uptake did not reach steady state. Efficient elimination also resulted in no bioaccumulation over an extended 25 day assay, with most individuals completely eliminating their microplastic burden in less than 5 days post exposure. Our results support recent findings of limited acute toxicity of ingested microplastics at this trophic level, and suggest sublethal chronic end points should be the focus of further ecotoxicological investigation.

Small crustaceans are regarded as being less motile than most fish species. Crustaceans also display low levels of active avoidance from trawl netting, which in turn may cause direct contact with netting on multiple occasions on their passage towards the codend increasing the probability for escapement. Full-scaled experiments to estimate gear selectivity are highly resource demanding and are highly technically challenging for several types of fisheries. In this study, we developed and tested a trawl-independent towed-rig construction designed to investigate size selectivity of Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba). The results indicate that valid selectivity estimates can be obtained using this method, but due to the small sample size, results are inconclusive. However, the findings of the current study show a potential for developing easier and more cost-effective ways of investigating and estimating size selectivity of Antarctic krill and other small crustacean species in trawls.

J	BUCHHOLZ, F				BUCHHOLZ, F			MOLT CYCLE AND GROWTH OF ANTARCTIC KRILL EUPHAUSIA-SUPERBA IN THE LABORATORY	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												Using systems for long-term maintenance of Antarctic krill Euphausia superba in aquaria, positive growth was measured in a large number of specimens under controlled conditions. The first moult always showed the greatest growth increment. The high laboratory growth rates agreed with previous field investigations. Often-reported 'abnormal' slow and predominantly negative growth was probably due to inadequate maintenance procedures. Moulting was partly synchronous, and moult frequency was temperature dependent. Growth of Antarctic krill did not match the slow rates expected of a polar species. Krill was very sensitive to experimental variation in feeding regime: (1) moult frequency (14 to 29 d) and (2) growth increment at moult (-15 to 21 %) varied together. Ecdysis and the staging and timing of the moult cycle were studied. The stage definitions of Buchholz (1982; Mar. Biol. 66: 301-305) were expanded and are now applicable to frozen krill and for field investigations, and include a simple classification key. Regular histological changes in the integument and consistent changes in the titre of the moult hormone could be attributed to distinct stages of the moult cycle. A clear temporal correlation confirmed the physiological relevance of the staging system. A possible 'resting' stage between post- and pre-ecdysis was not found. The apparent plasticity of growth parameters indicates that, in the wild, krill is able to adapt to strong regional and seasonal changes in feeding conditions, typical for Antarctic waters. Krill grows fast, and in spite of being predominantly planktonic, attains a large size. This enables fast swimming which facilitates location of rich food sources. Favourable feeding conditions immediately initiate growth. Essentially unhindered motility during actual moult and extremely fast ecdysis were interpreted as an adaptation to a pelagic way of life.																	0171-8630					JAN	1991	69	3					217	229		10.3354/meps069217							WOS:A1991EW10900002

The northern krill, Meganyctiphanes norvegica, is extremely widely distributed from the arctic North Atlantic to the warm Mediterranean. Respiration measurements showed no seasonal differences in rates determined in krill from the thermally stable Clyde Sea (Scotland) and the cooler but variable Danish Kattegat. In the warm Ligurian Sea. where temperatures are stable, krill showed higher rates in April than in September. indicating reactions to the short but intensive productive season. Krill can passively benefit from enhancements of overall metabolism when ascending into upper. warmer water strata during their pronounced diel vertical migration. Michaelis-Menten constants (K-m) of citrate synthase (CS) were compared. In terms of respiration and enzyme regulation, krill from the Ligurian Sea stand apart: temperature and nutrition appear to be of different influence. relatable to genetic differentiation in the species. In contrast, K-m of CS in E. superba is temperature independent, highlighting the species stenothermal physiology. A basal level of activity of digestive enzymes ensures immediate utilization of patchy food sources. Specific induction, including that of chitinases, indicating omnivory in both species, underlines krill's exceptional capacity to adapt to highly variable trophic environments. Processes of moult, growth, and reproduction are locally and seasonally adjusted.

A key species of the Southern Ocean ecosystem, the Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) has evolved rhythmic physiological and behavioral mechanisms to adapt to daily and seasonal changes. The molecular organization of the clockwork underlying these biological rhythms is, nevertheless, still only partially understood. Methodology/Principal Findings: The genome sequence of the Antarctic krill is not yet available. A normalized cDNA library was produced and pyrosequenced in the attempt to identify large numbers of transcripts. All available E. superba sequences were then assembled to create the most complete existing oligonucleotide microarray platform with a total of 32,217 probes. Gene expression signatures of specimens collected in the Ross Sea at five different time points over a 24-hour cycle were defined, and 1,308 genes differentially expressed were identified. Of the corresponding transcripts, 609 showed a significant sinusoidal expression pattern; about 40% of these exibithed a 24-hour periodicity while the other 60% was characterized by a shorter (about 12-hour) rhythm. We assigned the differentially expressed genes to functional categories and noticed that those concerning translation, proteolysis, energy and metabolic process, redox regulation, visual transduction and stress response, which are most likely related to daily environmental changes, were significantly enriched. Two transcripts of peroxiredoxin, thought to represent the ancestral timekeeping system that evolved about 2.5 billion years ago, were also identified as were two isoforms of the EsRh1 opsin and two novel arrestin1 sequences involved in the visual transduction cascade. Conclusions: Our work represents the first characterization of the krill diurnal transcriptome under natural conditions and provides a first insight into the genetic regulation of physiological changes, which occur around the clock during an Antarctic summer day.

Maximum yield of krill protein isolate reached 28.66% by precipitation at 4.6. Krill protein isolate demonstrated its excellent nutritional values through amino acid composition and in vitro digestibility. Thermal transition of krill protein isolate was determined by differential scanning calorimetry measurement. Extrapolated values of glass transition temperature (T-g) and denaturation temperature (T-d) of krill protein isolate were 33.8 degrees C and 80.3 degrees C when the heating rate was 2 degrees C/min. Dispersions of krill protein isolate generated self-supported gels at concentrations above 100 g/L without the addition of salt or other additives. A noticeable enhancement of gel strength was induced through cooling. Gels with krill protein isolate displayed a thermo-reversible behavior under repeating heating/cooling cycles, which was primarily due to the formation and disruption of hydrogen bonds. Network strength of protein gels was strongly dependent on protein concentrations. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Piccolin, F; Pitzschler, L; Biscontin, A; Kawaguchi, S; Meyer, B				Piccolin, Fabio; Pitzschler, Lisa; Biscontin, Alberto; Kawaguchi, So; Meyer, Bettina			Circadian regulation of diel vertical migration (DVM) and metabolism in Antarctic krill Euphausia superba	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS												Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) are high latitude pelagic organisms which play a key ecological role in the ecosystem of the Southern Ocean. To synchronize their daily and seasonal life-traits with their highly rhythmic environment, krill rely on the implementation of rhythmic strategies which might be regulated by a circadian clock. A recent analysis of krill circadian transcriptome revealed that their clock might be characterized by an endogenous free-running period of about 12-15 h. Using krill exposed to simulated light/dark cycles (LD) and constant darkness (DD), we investigated the circadian regulation of krill diel vertical migration (DVM) and oxygen consumption, together with daily patterns of clock gene expression in brain and eyestalk tissue. In LD, we found clear 24 h rhythms of DVM and oxygen consumption, suggesting a synchronization with photoperiod. In DD, the DVM rhythm shifted to a 12 h period, while the peak of oxygen consumption displayed a temporal advance during the subjective light phase. This suggested that in free-running conditions the periodicity of these clock-regulated output functions might reflect the shortening of the endogenous period observed at the transcriptional level. Moreover, differences in the expression patterns of clock gene in brain and eyestalk, in LD and DD, suggested the presence in krill of a multiple oscillator system. Evidence of short periodicities in krill behavior and physiology further supports the hypothesis that a short endogenous period might represent a circadian adaption to cope with extreme seasonal photoperiodic variability at high latitude.

The dielectric constants and dielectric loss factor of amino acids were 2.0 +/- 0.4 and 0.2 +/- 0.3, respectively (moisture contents, 0.05-0.33%), except those of lysine (5.5 +/- 0.5 and 1.5 +/- 1.0, respectively) (moisture content, 4.5%). The dielectric properties of non-polar, neutral-polar, alkaline amino acids added to Antarctic krill were affected by the frequency and moisture contents, molecular weight, and isoelectric points (pI) of amino acids. As the molecular weight and pI values increased, the critical frequencies of aliphatic amino acid added to minced Antarctic krill decreased, whereas heterocyclic amino acid added to minced Antarctic krill increased. Quantitative relationships between parameters that define both the real and the imaginary parts of the Debye relations and the weight fraction of amino acid contents in Antarctic krill were determined. Moreover, glycine (at 5%) or lysine (at 5%) significantly influenced the dielectric constants and dielectric loss factor of minced Antarctic krill (p < 0.05) but did not have significant effects on temperature history and distribution (p < 0.05) during microwave heating at 2450 MHz.																	1935-5130	1935-5149				OCT	2017	10	10					1809	1823		10.1007/s11947-017-1952-x							WOS:000409365300006						
J	DALY, KL				DALY, KL			OVERWINTERING DEVELOPMENT, GROWTH, AND FEEDING OF LARVAL EUPHAUSIA-SUPERBA IN THE ANTARCTIC MARGINAL ICE-ZONE	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Seasonal extent of pack ice has enormous influence on the Antarctic ecosystem. An investigation of the marginal ice zone in winter took place in the Scotia-Weddell Seas, a major nursery ground for the Antarctic krill Euphausia superba. Krill larvae were abundant at the ice edge and on the undersurfaces of ice floes where the pack ice provided greater concentrations of food and a superior refuge compared to the water column. Larval development and growth, which is dependent on food supply, progressed steadily from June through August. In early June, furcilia stages F3-F5 were most abundant but, by August, F6s and juveniles predominated. Krill molted about every 20 d and growth rates (0.07 mm d-1) were similar to reported summer rates. Gut fullness indicated that 98% of the larvae were feeding both day and night. Ingestion rates based on gut pigments, however, were inadequate to meet respiratory requirements. Dietary analysis revealed that in addition to diatoms, larvae ingest protozoans and possibly detritus. If heterotrophic C is considered, larval krill feeding on sea ice biota could ingest sufficient C to support observed growth. Seasonal pack ice coverage over nursery grounds thus plays an important role in the overwintering of larval krill.																	0024-3590					NOV	1990	35	7					1564	1576		10.4319/lo.1990.35.7.1564							WOS:A1990EX80500011

POLAR BIOLOGY												The Southern Ocean is expected to be significantly affected by future ocean acidification. Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) is the key species of the Southern Ocean ecosystem. Understanding their behavioural responses to acidification is critical for assessing the impacts of ocean acidification on the ecosystem. Adult Antarctic krill reared in different holding tanks with various CO2 levels for 6 months prior to the experiments were tested for their behavioural responses to different carbon dioxide partial pressures (pCO(2)) (400, 1000, 1500, 2000, and 4000 mu atm pCO(2)) in a two-channel flume. The time krill occupied either of the flume channels (with high or ambient CO2 levels) was highly variable in all tests. In most cases no significant preference to either side of the flume was found. The krill did not display any systematic discrimination to the sea water with different CO2 levels regardless of the CO2 levels that krill were acclimated for in the 6 months prior to the experiment. Poor ability to discriminate high CO2 waters may have an important implication to their life history in the future as ocean acidification rapidly progresses in parts of Southern Ocean.

J	Xue, M; Zhu, GP				Xue, Mei; Zhu, Guoping			Variation in fatty acids of Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) preserved under constant dry conditions: Does storage time and ontogeny matter?	JOURNAL OF FOOD PROCESSING AND PRESERVATION												As a key species in the Antarctic food web, Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) is a potentially healthy source of lipids, containing two of the most important omega 3 fatty acids. However, the degree of unsaturation of long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids, especially those from the omega 3 family, makes dry samples of the species vulnerable to oxidative degradation during long-term storage. The ontogenetic and temporal variation in fatty acids of dry krill tissues preserved under ambient temperature is unclear. To investigate the effects of long-term storage at ambient temperatures on degradation of fatty acids in krill, variation in the fatty acid composition of dried tissues at 0, 4, and 8 months was investigated. The results showed that storage time had a significant effect on fatty acid composition. When preserved for up to 4 months, the fatty acid content of krill changed dramatically, after which the proportion of fatty acids stabilized. Sensitivity to oxidation varied with the type of fatty acid, and krill size had an effect on the antioxidant capacity of fatty acids. Novelty impact statement The ontogenetic and temporal variation in fatty acids of dry Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) tissues preserved under ambient temperature was investigated. Storage time had a significant effect on fatty acid composition for long-term storage of dried krill tissue preserved at a constant temperature. Krill size affected the degree of fatty acid oxidation and larger individuals lost more polyunsaturated fatty acids in the long term (8 months). Four months is a valuable reference for studying the effects of storage time on fatty acid degradation of krill tissue to maximize its nutritional value.																	0145-8892	1745-4549				APR	2021	45	4							e15357	10.1111/jfpp.15357		FEB 2021					WOS:000621509600001						
J	Johnson, ML; Tarling, GA				Johnson, Magnus L.; Tarling, Geraint A.			Influence of individual state on swimming capacity and behaviour of Antarctic krill Euphausia superba	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												Swarms of Antarctic krill are frequently biased towards certain body sizes, sexes, maturities and physiological states. However, the mechanisms causing such biases remain unclear, with some speculating on differential responses to chemical or visual cues. This study examines the influence of individual state on swimming behaviour and performance, which, in turn, may cause biases in swarm composition. The frequency and strength of pleopod beats as well as the overall swimming capacity of Antarctic krill Euphausia superba were measured using a tethering technique. Individual state was considered in terms of body size, sex, maturity, moult stage and stomach fullness. Significant differences in the rate and strength of pleopod strokes as well as in the overall swimming capacity were found between individuals in different states. Body size had one of the strongest influences, with beat rate decreasing and beat strength increasing with increasing size. The sex and maturity of an individual altered this pattern, with adult females having faster but weaker pleopod beats than males of equivalent size. The difference in swimming style of females may impose a different lifestyle to that of males. Moult stage also had a significant influence on swimming, with moulting/post-moult individuals having significantly lower swimming capacities, making them unlikely to keep pace with intermoult counterparts. Both the rate and the strength of the pleopod beat were significantly lower in satiated compared to unsatiated individuals, which may contribute to the dispersion of swarms during feeding.

Significant changes in all variables were encountered. Total ash, lipid, calcium, magnesium and strontium all increased in concentration following moulting. Water, protein and copper concentrations all decreased following ecdysis and increased again towards the end of the moult cycle. The major ions sodium and potassium fluctuated around mean levels. Cast moults of E. superba were shown to be a drain on the ionic load of the krill, and the losses inherent in exuviation could account for much of the variation observed during the moult cycle.																	0025-3162					JUN	1992	113	2					201	209									WOS:A1992JA91100004						
J	Reiss, CS; Hinke, JT; Watters, GM				Reiss, Christian S.; Hinke, Jefferson T.; Watters, George M.			Demographic and maturity patterns of Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) in an overwintering hotspot	POLAR BIOLOGY												Overwinter environmental conditions are a major driver of larval survival, recruitment, and reproductive pre-conditioning in Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba). Few winter studies exist from which to infer impacts of changing environmental conditions on the biology of krill. Here demographic and maturity patterns of krill during five winters are examined at an overwintering hotspot in the northern Antarctic Peninsula. Two different recruitment pulses were present over the 5 years of the study. A large recruitment event was evident in winter 2012, followed by cohort growth tracked through winter 2014. A recruitment event also occurred in 2015, despite lower abundance of larvae in 2013 and 2014. The recruitment pulse in 2015 was correlated with the intrusion of high salinity water, characteristic of the Weddell Sea, during a positive El Nino-Southern Oscillation phase, suggesting recruitment was driven by advection of recruits into the northern Antarctic Peninsula. Despite the inter-annual environmental variability, most female krill were in resting reproductive stages in all years. The lack of variability in female reproductive status during winter may impose a developmental constraint to earlier spawning than previously considered; the time necessary to advance from resting stages to reproductive maturity may limit the ability of krill to adapt to trends in the timing and magnitude of the spring bloom. The observed patterns of recruitment and variation in maturity stages highlight the complexity of krill population dynamics and should be considered when projecting population responses of Antarctic krill to climate-driven changes in the Southern Ocean.				, Jefferson/AAG-1702-2021	, Jefferson/0000-0002-3600-1414												0722-4060	1432-2056				SEP	2020	43	9					1233	1245		10.1007/s00300-020-02704-4		AUG 2020					WOS:000557139900001

The nutrient compositions and properties of the by-products were revealed by being compared to those of Antarctic krill muscle and the economically important species of freshwater prawns (Macrobrachium nipponense) and penaeid shrimps (Metapenaeus ensis). The by-products are worthy of utilization because of the high ratio to the total weight (65.7%). The crude protein contents in the muscle and by-products of krill are 17.4 and 11.7%, respectively. The krill proteins have higher contents of essential amino acids (EAAs). The EAAs constitute 42 and 37% of the TAAs in muscle and by-products, respectively. The krill processing by-products contain high levels of total lipid (3.3%), and polyunsaturated fatty acids constitute 34% of fatty acids with high levels of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA; 19.08%) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA; 10.02%). Krill meat provides considerable iron, zinc, calcium, selenium, and copper. It is imperative to lower the fluoride level (70.1 mg/kg, wet basis) in krill muscle. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) reveals that myosin heavy chain (MHC) and actin are the major proteins in muscle, and their contents vary between species.																	1049-8850	1547-0636					2016	25	3					434	443		10.1080/10498850.2013.809621							WOS:000378703000015						
J	Fach, BA; Meyer, B; Wolf-Gladrow, D; Bathmann, U				Fach, Bettina A.; Meyer, Bettina; Wolf-Gladrow, Dieter; Bathmann, Ulrich			Biochemically based modeling study of Antarctic krill Euphausia superba growth and development	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												A biochemical model of Antarctic krill Euphausia superba was developed to investigate the physiological mechanisms which enable krill to survive winter, when food is scarce. In this modeling approach data sets on the biochemical composition of krill and its food sources are combined into a model that takes food quality into account rather than just food availability during different seasons. Krill is defined in terms of protein, neutral lipid, polar lipid, carbohydrate, chitin, and ash content, and the model tracks krill neutral lipid content separately from weight. The model includes parameterizations of filtration, ingestion, and metabolic processes which determine krill growth rate. Initial ratios of protein, neutral lipid, polar lipid, carbohydrate and ash change in chitin response to the biochemical composition of food as krill grows. Model results show that a diet of phytoplankton food alone may be sufficient for krill to grow to observed sizes but may not be sufficient to provide the summer lipid resources that are observed in the field and that are necessary for krill to reproduce and survive winter. The inclusion of sea ice algae as an additional food is beneficial for krill at the end of winter but does not significantly change summer krill lipid content. However, the amount of lipids accumulated within krill increases significantly when krill feeds on lipid-rich heterotrophic food, which points to the importance of carnivory, even in times when phytoplankton food is available. The strategy of combusting body components to produce energy (shrinking) is found to provide the greatest source of energy for krill of all sizes during times of prolonged starvation.

Data were obtained using novel Surface and Under Ice Trawls (SUIT), which sampled the 0-2 m surface layer both under sea ice and in open water. Average surface layer densities ranged between 0.8 individuals m(-2) in summer and autumn, and 2.7 individuals m(-2) in winter. In summer, under-ice densities of Antarctic krill were significantly higher than in open waters. In autumn, the opposite pattern was observed. Under winter sea ice, densities were often low, but repeatedly far exceeded summer and autumn maxima. Statistical models showed that during summer high densities of Antarctic krill in the 0-2 m layer were associated with high ice coverage and shallow mixed layer depths, among other factors. In autumn and winter, density was related to hydrographical parameters. Average under-ice densities from the 0-2 m layer were higher than corresponding values from the 0-200 m layer collected with Rectangular Midwater Trawls (RMT) in summer. In winter, under-ice densities far surpassed maximum 0-200 m densities on several occasions. This indicates that the importance of the ice-water interface layer may be under-estimated by the pelagic nets and sonars commonly used to estimate the population size of Antarctic krill for management purposes, due to their limited ability to sample this habitat. Our results provide evidence for an almost year-round association of Antarctic krill with the under-ice habitat, hundreds of kilometres into the ice-covered area of the Lazarev Sea. Local concentrations of postlarval Antarctic krill under winter sea ice suggest that sea ice biota are important for their winter survival. These findings emphasise the susceptibility of an ecological key species to changing sea ice habitats, suggesting potential ramifications on Antarctic ecosystems induced by climate change.

The risk to fishery performance associated with spatially resolved management of Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) harvesting	ICES JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE												The ecosystem approach to fisheries attempts to define objectives for target species, the wider ecosystem, and critically, the fishery itself. Proposals for implementing the approach often include spatial restrictions on harvesting, so it is important to understand how these will affect fishery performance. One metric of potential performance is the probability of encountering exploitable densities of a target species at the scale of fishing operations. The probability of encountering exploitable densities of Antarctic krill, Euphausia superba, at the scale of 1 nautical mile during an acoustic survey was predicted by bathymetry and the mean krill density at the larger scale at which the fishery is managed. This suggests that the risk to fishery performance will increase if management actions relocate the fishery into deeper water. The results also suggest that ecosystem models resolved to the spatial scale of management units could usefully predict effects at the scale of fishing operations. However, correct parameterization of these models will require better characterization of threshold densities for efficient exploitation. Finally, the distribution of catch and fishing effort over an entire fishing season reflected the distribution of krill density observed during the survey.

Seasonal changes in photoperiod in Antarctica, ranging from midnight sun (24 h light) during mid-summer to very short days (3-4 h light) during mid-winter, represent a challenge for the synchronization of the krill circadian clock. We analyzed clock gene activity and clock output functions in krill exposed to different light conditions during a long-term photoperiodic simulation in the laboratory. In simulated early-autumn (light/dark or LD 16: 8) and late-winter (LD 8: 16) conditions, the circadian clock of krill was functional and the metabolic output was synchronized to the light/dark cycle, the clock genes Esper and Esclk peaked in antiphase around simulated dusk/dawn and most metabolic-related genes showed upregulation around simulated dusk. In contrast, in simulated mid-summer (light/light or LL) and mid-winter (LD 3: 21) conditions, the synchronization of the circadian clock and the metabolic output appeared to be weaker, with clock gene expression becoming arrhythmic and upregulation of metabolic genes occurring at different times during the day. Early-autumn and late-winter photoperiodic cues in the laboratory thus seem to be sufficient to entrain the krill clock and promote metabolic synchronization, whereas midwinter and mid-summer photoperiodic cues seem to be insufficient for krill entrainment. Krill in the field may overcome the seasonal lack of overt photoperiodic cycle occurring during midsummer and mid-winter by using alternative light-related Zeitgebers (i.e., varying light intensity rather than the presence or absence of light) to promote basic homeostatic rhythms over 24 h.

The total-lipid data for E. superba exhibited seasonal variations, with low lipid levels in late winter/early spring and the highest levels in autumn. Seasonal changes were most pronounced in the immature and adult specimens. increasing from about 10% lipid of dry mass to more than 40%. The fatty-acid compositions of the younger stages were dominated by 20:5(n-3), 22:6(n-3) and 16:0. These are typical phospholipid fatty acids, which are major biomembrane constituents. The phospholipid composition was similar in the older stages. With increasing storage of triacylglycerols in the lipid-rich immature and adult stages, the fatty acids 14:0, 16:0 and 18:1(n-9) prevailed, comprising about 70% of total triacylglycerol fatty acids. The trophic-marker fatty acids 16:1(n-7) and 18:4(n-3), indicating phytoplankton ingestion, were less abundant. They reflected, however, the dependence of the larvae on phytoplankton as well as the seasonal changes in algal composition. The generally close linear relationships between fatty acids and lipid suggest that the fatty-acid compositions of the collected specimens were largely independent of the respective developmental stage, season and region. The linear fit indicates that triacylglycerol accumulation started at a level of about 5% of total lipid. Considering the various overwintering scenarios under discussion, the life cycle and reproductive strategies of krill are discussed in the context of the lipid metabolism and fatty-acid composition of E. superba. Lipid production is effective enough to accumulate large energy reserves for the dark season, but E. superba does not exhibit the sophisticated biosynthetic pathways known from other Antarctic euphausiids and copepods. Although important, lipid utilisation appears to be just one of several strategies of E. superba to thrive under the extreme Antarctic conditions, and this pronounced versatility may explain the success of this species in the Southern Ocean.

During the Last Glaciation Maximum, at ca. 18 ka BP, both the Weddell and the Ross Gyres as well as near-coastal circulations probably lost their importance in the maintenance of Antarctic krill populations due to cooling of the water column and development of multi-year sea ice. Within the ACC at that time, some smaller-scale circulations related to islands and seamounts could have played a major role in controlling krill distribution. If, nevertheless, refugia for self-maintained krill populations remained in the near-coastal zone, particularly in the eastern Indian sector, geographical isolation might have caused divergence between the two species of the gregarine Cephaloidophora commonly infesting krill at present.																	0173-9565						1996	17	1-3					519	541		10.1111/j.1439-0485.1996.tb00525.x							WOS:A1996VL82400041

Extractable pigments from the eye and eyestalk ganglia were quantified using fluorescence intensity and standardised against protein. Three peak fluorescence intensities were detected at wavelengths of excitation 280 nm, emission 625 nm (pigment 1); excitation 355 nm, emission 510 nm (pigment 2); and excitation 463 nm, emission 620 nm (pigment 3). There was a positive correlation between the quantity of pigments 1 and 3 and the age of Antarctic krill. A model was developed to predict age from pigment 3 and to compare it with other age proxies (carapace length and eyeball diameter). The quantity of pigment 3 was the best predictor of age. The pigment method can discriminate between similar sized krill aged 12 and 36 months. Age pigments provide an improved tool for age estimation in Antarctic krill, particularly if used in conjunction with other demographic information.

Krill protein isolate was phosphorylated by the dry-heating method with sodium pyrophosphate. Phosphorylated peptides from Antarctic krill (PP-AKP) were obtained from phosphorylated protein through tryptic hydrolysis. Two types of phosphate bonds were introduced by phosphorylation, i.e. P-O and P=O bonds. The anti-osteoporotic activities of PP-AKP at two doses (400 and 800 mg/kg body weight) were investigated with an osteoporotic rat model, which was established with bilateral ovariectomy surgery. Different doses of PP-AKP were given intraperitoneal injections to rats once a day with alendronate as a positive control. Phosphorylated peptides from Antarctic krill dose-dependently preserved bone mineral density in osteoporotic rats by increasing the degree of bone mineralization. Both trabecular and cortical bone strength in osteoporotic rats was significantly improved with PP-AKP treatment. The mechanism by which PP-AKP augmented bone mineral density and bone strength was relation to the reduction in osteoclast-mediated bone remodeling, as was supported by the decrease in bone resorption markers. Phosphorylated peptides from Antarctic krill could be developed as functional food or nutritional supplements. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Ages two through five years were validated, and these animals ranged from 37.1 to 62.6 mm in total length. The band counts in these individuals were either identical to their absolute ages, or only failed to agree by a few months, which demonstrates the accuracy of this method. Precision and bias were estimated graphically using Chang's index (Coefficient of Variation = 5.03%). High accuracy and precision between readers and low ageing bias indicate that longitudinal sections of eyestalks can be used to age krill in wild samples and to develop age-based stock assessment models for krill. Archival samples preserved in formalin (5%) and stored in ambient conditions were also readable. Ageing preserved krill will provide the opportunity to examine changes in growth among krill populations within the Southern Ocean and to retrospectively examine changes in krill production over the last century to better understand the historical and future impacts of climate change on this critical Southern Ocean species.

The effects of the hydrolysates on cholecystokinin (CCK) secretion and cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) activation were tested in murine enteroendocrine cell line STC-1. Meanwhile, the signaling mechanism by which the hydrolysates induce CCK secretion was investigated by using inhibitors of signaling proteins. Results indicated that KPHSD and KPHAP both could significantly stimulate CCK secretion and CREB activation. The stimulating effects on CCK release showed a positive correlation with the relative content of peptides with molecular weight ranging from 1,000 to 3,000 Da, indicating this component may mainly account for the ability. The inhibitors on calcium-sensing receptor, PKA, Ca2+/CaMKII, P-38-MAPK, and an intracellular calcium chelator all inhibited krill protein hydrolysates-induced CCK secretion and CREB activation, indicating the involvement of the Ca2+/CaM/CaMK, cAMP/PKA and MAPK pathways in the stimulation of CCK secretion.																	0145-8892	1745-4549				JUN	2017	41	3							e12903	10.1111/jfpp.12903							WOS:000405783400018

Krill protein hydrolysate (KPH) by pepsin with 4-h hydrolysis showed the highest 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) scavenging and angiotensin I converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory activities. The solubility and foaming properties of KPH were higher than those of the unhydrolyzed krill protein at a wide range of pHs. KPH was further fractionated based on molecular weight. The 1- to 3-kDa peptide fraction exhibited the highest DPPH scavenging activity (IC50 value of 0.5 mg/mL), oxygen radical absorbance capacity (497.39 +/- 4.31 mu M TE/mg fraction), 2,2-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzthiazoline)-6-sulfonic acid cation radical scavenging activity (48.41 +/- 0.23 mu M TE/mg fraction), and reducing power (110.40 +/- 2.07 mu M TE/mg fraction). However, the < 1-kDa peptide fraction exhibited a higher ACE inhibitory activity than that of other fractions.

Southern Right Whale (Eubalaena australis) Reproductive Success is Influenced by Krill (Euphausia superba) Density and Climate	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS												The reproductive success of southern right whale (Eubalaena australis) depends on body condition and, therefore, on foraging success. This, in turn, might be affected by climatically driven change in the abundance of the species main prey, krill (Euphausia superba), on the feeding grounds. Annual data on southern right whale number of calves were obtained from aerial surveys carried out between 1997 and 2013 in southern Brazil, where the species concentrate during their breeding season. The number of calves recorded each year varied from 7 to 43 ((x) over bar = 21.11 +/- 11.88). Using cross-correlation analysis we examined the response of the species to climate anomalies and krill densities. Significant correlations were found with krill densities (r = 0.69, p = 0.002, lag 0 years), Oceanic Nino Index (r = -0.65, p = 0.03, lag 6 years), Antarctic Oscillation (r = 0.76, p = 0.01, lag 7 years) and Antarctic sea ice area (r = -0.68, p = 0.002, lag 0 years). Our results suggest that global climate indices influence southern right whale breeding success in southern Brazil by determining variation in food (krill) availability for the species. Therefore, increased frequency of years with reduced krill abundance, due to global warming, is likely to reduce the current rate of recovery of southern right whales from historical overexploitation.

Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) are a keystone species of the Antarctic sea ice ecosystem. Krill have repeatedly been found to accumulate a diverse array of POPs and thereby serve as vectors of these to the remainder of the Antarctic food web. p,p'-Dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (p,p'-DDE) is a dominant POP compound accumulating in Antarctic krill and higher trophic level predators. Recently, p,p'-DDE uptake dynamics, associated behavioural and developmental toxicity were evaluated in this species. The present study investigated the response of enzymes with known roles in detoxification (glutathione S-transferase, GST and cytochrome P450 2B, CYP2B), neurotoxicity (acetylcholinesterase, AChE) and oxidative stress (glutathione peroxidase GPx) in Antarctic krill exposed to p,p'-DDE. CYP2B was not detectable in Antarctic krill. No strong concentration responses resulted from the exposure to p,p'-DDE. These findings do not provide evidence for an activated detoxification response to this compound via the tested biochemical pathways in Antarctic krill. This is the first time that GST, AChE and GPx have been characterised in this species following pollutant exposure. Further research with additional pollutants and compound mixtures is necessary to assess the practical role of these enzymes as biomarkers of pollutant exposure in Antarctic krill. These first exploratory findings present a valuable contribution to a critical knowledge gap in polar ecotoxicology, namely the comparative sensitivity of polar organisms relative to temperate and tropical counterparts.

Individual krill respond to a changing landscape of predation risk and food availability by migrating vertically in the column and choosing an average distance to their nearest neighbor (swarm density). We determine the optimal behavior of 30, 40 and 50 mm krill using a state-dependent life history model where individuals move along 30-day segments of hypothetical journey tracks in three different regions of the Scotia Sea, with the tracks extracted from a combination of circulation models and surface drifter data. Food availability is based on satellite data for surface Chl and with additional heterotrophic and detritus food components, and mortality is parameterized with respect to distance from shore, daylight and krill swarming-behavior. We predict that proximity to predator colonies has a distinct effect on behavior, particularly on depth choice when food-availability is low. Observations made during an acoustic survey of the region found swarms to be deeper at the Antarctic Peninsula compared with South Georgia, in line with model pedictions. Our pedictions are also consistent with observations that swarm density, changes little on a logarithmic scale across the region. We show that being able to change behavior on short time scales has distinct advantages to krill.

Besides vertebrates, melatonin has been detected throughout phylogeny in numerous non-vertebrate taxa. In the present study, the occurrence of melatonin in Antarctic krill Euphausia superba and its possible role in mediating seasonal metabolic changes was evaluated. Melatonin was quantified by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) purified extracts of eyestalks and hemolymph of krill sampled in the Lazarev Sea during the Antarctic winter and summer. In addition, oxygen uptake rates and the activities of the metabolic enzyme malate dehydrogenase (MDH) were recorded to assess the metabolic status of krill. Validation of melatonin measurements was carried out on the basis of three different extraction methods with parallel determination of melatonin by ELISA in crude extracts and in HPLC purified extracts, and after derivatization of melatonin under alkaline conditions in the presence of hydrogen peroxide. A significantly higher respiration rate and MDH activity was found in summer krill than in winter krill indicating that krill was in a state of reduced metabolic activity during winter. However, neither during winter nor during summer there were detectable melatonin concentrations in the visual system or hemolymph of krill. Based on these results, we question a mediating role of melatonin in the control of seasonal metabolic changes in Antarctic krill. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

DISTRIBUTION AND SIZE-AGE COMPOSITION OF ANTARCTIC KRILL (EUPHAUSIA SUPERBA) IN THE SOUTH ORKNEY ISLANDS REGION (CCAMLR SUBAREA 48.2)	CCAMLR SCIENCE												The distribution, size-age composition and biological condition of Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) caught by the Russian krill trawler FV Maxim Starostin in Subarea 48.2 between January and March in 2009 and 2010 are described. The distribution of size-age groups in association with particular water masses indicated that age 2+ krill dominated in cold Weddell Sea waters in the southern parts of the fishing area, while older age classes (3+, 4+, 5+) dominated in Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) waters in the northern parts. No 1+ age cohort was found in catches in 2009 or in 2010. This absence of 1+ E. superba is unlikely to be a result of trawl selectivity as adult Pygmy krill (E. frigida) (of the same size as 1+ krill) were present in the catches.																	1023-4063						2011	18						123	134									WOS:000208703000008

Varying depth and swarm dimensions of open-ocean Antarctic krill Euphausia superba Dana, 1850 (Euphausiacea) over diel cycles	JOURNAL OF CRUSTACEAN BIOLOGY												Diel vertical migration (DVM) behaviour in swarms of Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba Dana, 1850) is notoriously variable, with swarms being found at a range of depths and in different shapes, sizes, and packing concentrations throughout the day-night cycle. Because social aggregation can potentially serve the same purpose as DVM in minimising predation risk, krill may use both strategies to varying extents. Diel variation was examined in swarm depth, length, perimeter, area, thickness, and packing concentration across 4,130 open-ocean swarms in the Scotia Sea during summer. Inter-relationships between each of the swarm descriptors were complex but multivariate analyses identified pairings in levels of similarity between area and perimeter, thickness and packing concentration, and depth and length. Second-stage analysis further identified diel cyclicity in these relationships. Swarm parameters were more variable than depth over the diel cycle, identifying swarming to be the primary diel response to which DVM is a secondary contributor.

Stable isotopes identify an ontogenetic niche expansion in Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) from the South Shetland Islands, Antarctica	MARINE BIOLOGY												Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) occupy a key position in the Southern Ocean linking primary production to secondary consumers. While krill is a dominant grazer of phytoplankton, it also consumes heterotrophic prey and the relative importance of these two resources may differ with ontogeny. We used stable isotope analyses to evaluate body size-dependent trophic and habitat shifts in krill during the austral summer around the South Shetland Islands, Antarctica. We found evidence for an asymmetric, ontogenetic niche expansion with adults of both sexes having higher and more variable delta N-15 values but consistent delta C-13 values in comparison with juveniles. This result suggests that while phytoplankton likely remains an important life-long resource, krill in our study area expand their dietary niche to include higher trophic food sources as body size increases. The broader dietary niches observed in adults may help buffer them from recent climate-driven shifts in phytoplankton communities that negatively affect larval or juvenile krill that rely predominately on autotrophic resources.

J	Perissinotto, R; Gurney, L; Pakhomov, EA				Perissinotto, R; Gurney, L; Pakhomov, EA			Contribution of heterotrophic material to diet and energy budget of Antarctic krill, Euphausia superba	MARINE BIOLOGY												A novel approach was used to estimate the heterotrophic carbon component in the diet of the Antarctic krill Euphausia superba. Over 200 specimens from seven samples collected in the Lazarev Sea (January 1993 and 1995), at the Antarctic Polar Front (January 1993), and around South Georgia (February/March 1994) were dissected, and the total carbon content of their stomachs was estimated with a CHN-analyser. Gut-pigment contents were also measured by the gut-fluorescence technique in specimens collected at the same time, and the equivalent amount of their gut carbon was then subtracted from the total organic carbon content of guts from the same samples. The remaining carbon was assumed to originate entirely from heterotrophic food sources. This heterotrophic component accounted for a substantial proportion of the total food consumed by Antarctic krill, ranging from 17.4 to 98.9% of the mass of the gut contents (mean = 78.8% +/- 21.2 SD). The results make an important contribution to the elucidation of the energy budget of krill and its daily carbon ration. With a few exceptions, previous estimates were largely calculated from a solely autotrophic carbon source, and were unable to account for the metabolic requirements of E. superba. Krill plays an important role in Antarctic food webs, as it often constitutes similar or equal to 50% of the total biomass of the zoo-plankton, and produces fast-sinking, dense faecal pellets which are important in the vertical transport of organic carbon from the euphotic layer to the deep ocean. High consumption rates of smaller heterotrophic organisms by krill suggest that this large microphage may be more important than previously believed in re-packaging micro- and mesozooplankton into a longer-lasting and more easily sequestered carbon pool.																	0025-3162					FEB	2000	136	1					129	135		10.1007/s002270050015							WOS:000085966300015

Cycles of Euphausia superba recruitment evident in the diet of Pygoscelid penguins and net trawls in the South Shetland Islands, Antarctica	POLAR BIOLOGY												Size and sex of Antarctic krill taken from chinstrap and gentoo penguin diet were compared to those from scientific net surveys in the South Shetland Islands from 1998 to 2006 in order to evaluate penguin diet as a sampling mechanism and to look at trends in krill populations. Both penguin diet and net samples revealed a 4-5 year cycle in krill recruitment with one or two strong cohorts sustaining the population during each cycle. Penguin diet samples contained adult krill of similar lengths to those caught in nets; however, penguins rarely took juvenile krill. Penguin diet samples contained proportionately more females when the krill population was dominated by large adults at the end of the cycles; net samples showed greater proportions of males in these years. These patterns are comparable to those reported elsewhere in the region and are likely driven by the availability of different sizes and sexes of krill in relation to the colony.																	0722-4060	1432-2056				NOV	2007	30	12					1615	1623		10.1007/s00300-007-0326-7							WOS:000249920800012

In this study respiration rates and pleopod beating rates were measured at six current speeds. Pleopod beating rates increased linearly with current speed, reaching a maximum of 6 beats s(-1) at 17 cm s(-1). There was a concomitant linear increase in respiration rate, from 1.8 mg O-2 g(D)(-1) h(-1) at 3 cm s(-1) to 8.0 mg O-2 g(D)(-1) h(-1) at 17 cm s(-1). The size of the group tested ( 50, 100 and 300 krill) did not have a significant effect on pleopod beating rates or oxygen consumption (ANCOVA, F= 0.264; P> 0.05). The cost of transport reached a maximum of 75 J g(-1) km(-1) at 5 cm s(-1), and then decreased with increasing current speed to 29 J g(-1) km(-1). When considered in light of energy budgets for E. superba, these data indicate that the cost of swimming could account for up to 73% of total daily metabolic expenditure during early summer.

J	Teschke, M; Kawaguchi, S; Meyer, B				Teschke, Mathias; Kawaguchi, So; Meyer, Bettina			Effects of simulated light regimes on maturity and body composition of Antarctic krill, Euphausia superba	MARINE BIOLOGY												The effect of different light regimes on the development of sexual maturity and body composition (carbon, nitrogen, lipid and protein) of Antarctic krill, Euphausia superba, was studied over 12 weeks under laboratory conditions. Krill were exposed to light-cycle regimes of variable intensity to simulate Southern Ocean summer, autumn and winter conditions, respectively using: (1) continuous light (LL; 200 lux max), (2) 12-h light and 12-h darkness (LD 12:12; 50 lux max), and (3) continuous darkness (DD). The sexual maturity of female and male krill exposed to LL and LD 12:12 showed an accelerated succession of external maturity stages during the experimental period, while krill exposed to continuous darkness showed no changes in external maturity during the course of the study. Changes in the maturity development of krill between the different light regimes are reflected in changes in body composition. Krill exposed to LL and LD 12:12 showed an increase in lipid utilization, indicating that the development of external maturation may be fuelled preferentially by lipid reserves. In contrast, values of total lipid content of krill held under continuous darkness indicated an unchanged lipid catabolism during the course of the study. Thus, the maturity development of krill was affected either directly or indirectly by the different simulated light conditions. Based on these results, and observations on the effects of simulated light regimes on feeding and metabolic rates of krill available from a previous study, we suggest that the Antarctic light regime is an essential cue governing the seasonal cycle of krill physiology and maturity, and highlight the importance of this environmental factor in the life history of krill.

This study reports the results of an expressed sequence tag (EST) sequencing project from different tissues of Euphausia superba (the Antarctic krill). Results: We have constructed and sequenced five cDNA libraries from different Antarctic krill tissues: head, abdomen, thoracopods and photophores. We have identified 1.770 high-quality ESTs which were assembled into 216 overlapping clusters and 801 singletons resulting in a total of 1.017 non-redundant sequences. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis was performed to quantify and validate the expression levels of ten genes presenting different EST countings in krill tissues. In addition, bioinformatic screening of the non-redundant E. superba sequences identified 69 microsatellite containing ESTs. Clusters, consensuses and related similarity and gene ontology searches were organized in a dedicated E. superba database http://krill.cribi.unipd.it. Conclusion: We defined the first tissue transcriptional signatures of E. superba based on functional categorization among the examined tissues. The analyses of annotated transcripts showed a higher similarity with genes from insects with respect to Malacostraca possibly as an effect of the limited number of Malacostraca sequences in the public databases. Our catalogue provides for the first time a genomic tool to investigate the biology of the Antarctic krill.

The TS which is used to convert acoustic backscatter to krill density was also presented. Body shape data were obtained from 456 specimens (54 juveniles, 200 males, and 202 females) collected off Adelie Land using a Rectangular Midwater Trawl. The sexual dimorphism manifested as a swollen cephalothorax in female krill with body lengths exceeding 40 mm. The TS of female krill was higher than those of male krill at low frequencies, even when body lengths were the same. This is because of the Rayleigh scattering region and the transition region to the geometric scattering region. The influence of the sexual dimorphism on the TS was small at frequencies exceeding 70 kHz, which are close to the geometric scattering region. The regression curve derived from the predicted TS of 456 specimens was in reasonable agreement with the measured TS in other previous studies, and the regression curve could be applied to the acoustic surveys of Antarctic krill.

The estimation of the age-dependent annual extinction rate of krill [THETA = 1 - exp(- M)] was obtained using the Zikov and Slepokurov (1982) approach and results were fitted by a parabolic equation. The coefficients of instantaneous natural mortality (M) of E. superba derived with this approach range from 0.52 during the maturation period, to 1.1-2.41 during the first and last years of life. The aim of this work is to apply an ichthyological approach to the estimation of natural, age-dependent, mortality rates of Antarctic krill. All data used in the analysis are from the central part of the Indian sector of the Southern Ocean.																	0722-4060					JAN	1995	15	1					69	71									WOS:A1995PX44100011

Spatial-temporal relationships between two euphausiid species in the Ross Sea	CHEMISTRY AND ECOLOGY					Joint Scientific Meeting of the National-Inter-University-Consortium-For-Marine-Sciences/XVI Congress of the Italian-Association-for-Oceanology-and-Limnology	OCT 18-22, 2004	Palermo, ITALY	CoNISMa, AIOL				This paper summarizes the results obtained during the Italian marine Antarctic expeditions to the Ross Sea in November and December 1994, December 1997, and January 2000. The distribution and abundance of the two krill species (Euphausia superba and Euphausia crystallorophias) are shown in relation to the degree of ice cover, and a potential mechanism is presented that allows the coexistence of the two similar species in the same region. The surveys indicate that the northern and north-western areas of the Ross Sea are largely dominated by Euphausia superba, while the southern and southwestern areas are dominated by Euphausia crystallorophias. The two krill populations show some overlap in the central part of the Ross Sea, where the distribution of the two species appears related to the ice cover. The biomass centroids of the two krill species seem to move northward associated with the ice edge retreat in summer. The centroid of the Euphausia superba biomass moves much faster and further than that of Euphausia crystallorophias and reaches ice-free waters at the edge of the Ross Sea in summer. This suggests that the spatial extent of the Euphausia superba population may extend beyond the Ross Sea, and a portion of this population may spread into the ocean waters starting in early January. In contrast, the Euphausia crystallorophias population appears to be restricted to the Ross Sea.

In this work, the functional ingredients are extracted by an improved aqueous enzymatic extraction method, where exogenous enzymes are not consumed and soybean oil is chosen as co-solvent. The optimal conditions for oil recovery are determined to be a water addition of 30%, an initial pH of 7.5, a temperature of 43.2 degrees C, an autolysis time of 6h, and a soybean oil addition ratio (g/g) of 3. Meanwhile, the oil recovery rate is 76.7%. The recovered oil contains 44.24mgkg(-1) astaxanthin and its total fatty acids contain 1.1% EPA and 0.6% DHA. The moisture and volatile matter content, acid value, and peroxide value of recovered oil are sufficient to meet the first grade requirements of soybean oil. The oxidative stability of recovered oil is close to that of soybean oil at room temperature. The recovered oil can be taken as a good source of EPA, DHA, and astaxanthin for consideration of use as an edible oil item for human consumption.Practical Applications: Antarctic krill (Euphasia superba) are generally known as huge biomass resources, strong endogenous enzymes, and rich sources of functional ingredients including EPA, DHA, and astaxanthin. In this work, the strong endogenous enzymes are employed to extract the functional ingredients from E. superba using soybean oil as co-solvent. Furthermore, chemical compositions, physicochemical properties, and oxidative stabilities of the recovered oil are investigated. The results are useful for the extensive utilization of E. superba in food industry. The functional ingredients including EPA, DHA, and astaxanthin in krill are extracted by an improved aqueous enzymatic extraction method, where exogenous enzymes are not consumed and soybean oil is chosen as co-solvent.

Distribution of larval krill and zooplankton in association with hydrography in Marguerite Bay, Antarctic Peninsula, in austral fall and winter 2001 described using the Video Plankton Recorder	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY												The Western Antarctic Peninsula is a critical locus of Antarctic krill Euphausia superba abundance and thought to be a site of successful overwintering, particularly for the larval stages. A primary goal of the Southern Ocean GLOBEC program was to describe factors that contribute to the overwintering success of krill in this region. As part of this effort we conducted Video Plankton Recorder (VPR) surveys during austral fall and winter, 2001. The VPR survey yielded high-resolution distributions of larval krill, other plankton, and marine snow in relation to hydrography from a series of transect lines orthogonal to the coast on the continental shelf of the Western Antarctic Peninsula. Four taxa (larval krill, copepods, polychaetes, pteropods) and marine snow were numerous during fall; much lower abundances of all categories were present during winter, with only larval krill, copepods, and polychaetes present in any abundance. Distributions of plankton and marine snow were associated with water-mass types and the vertical structure of the environment, particularly for larval krill that were primarily associated with the pycnocline. During fall, larval krill were present across the entire shelf, with high abundances at the shelf break. Copepods were most numerous at depth during fall, consistent with ontogenetic migration to depth at the onset of winter. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Cripps, GC; Hill, HJ				Cripps, GC; Hill, HJ			Changes in lipid composition of copepods and Euphausia superba associated with diet and environmental conditions in the marginal ice zone, Bellingshausen Sea, Antarctica	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART I-OCEANOGRAPHIC RESEARCH PAPERS												The effect of varying diet and environmental conditions at the Marginal Ice Zone (MIZ) on the fatty acid and hydrocarbon compositions of five species of copepod and krill, Euphausia superba, was investigated. Zooplankton at the MIZ experienced a range of conditions, from a low algal biomass (mainly flagellates) under pack-ice to a spring bloom dominated by diatoms in the open ocean. Principal Component Analysis classified the copepods into three dietary regimes: (i) omnivores or general algal feeders under the pack ice, (ii) dinoflagellate feeders, and (iii) diatom feeders in the open ocean. This classification was supported by the distribution of the diatom marker n-heneicosahexaene (n-C-21:6) and a general indicator of herbivory, the isoprenoid pristane. The fatty acid and hydrocarbon composition reflected dietary preferences and availability as the season progressed. Of the copepods under the pack-ice, Oithona spp. was omnivorous whereas Calanus propinquus was feeding preferentially on flagellates. Metridia gerlachei fed on flagellates in all conditions, but also included diatoms in its diet during the bloom. Calanoides acutus and Rhincalanus gigas, which passed the winter in diapause, were feeding almost exclusively on diatoms in the open ocean. Euphausia superba, which were also mainly diatom feeders in the open ocean, were feeding on the sea-ice algae (diatoms) and suspended material from the water column (dinoflagellates) under the pack-ice.

J	Hofmann, EE; Husrevoglu, YS				Hofmann, EE; Husrevoglu, YS			A circumpolar modeling study of habitat control of Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) reproductive success	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY												A one-dimensional, temperature-dependent model is implemented to simulate the descent-ascent cycle of Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) embryos and larvae. Inputs to the model are monthly mean climatologies of ambient temperature and density fields obtained from the World Ocean Atlas Database for Southern Ocean waters. Simulations are done with a 1degrees resolution at a circumpolar scale, south of 60degreesS, and the results are interpolated to a 5' grid to match the resolution of the bottom bathymetry data. Simulations of the descent-ascent cycle using environmental conditions corresponding to the Antarctic krill spawning season (December-March) resulted in unconstrained success in completion of the cycle in water deeper than 1000 in. Continental shelf regions favorable to successful hatching of Antarctic krill embryos are limited to areas along the west Antarctic Peninsula, large areas in the Bellingshausen and Amundsen Seas, offshore of Wilkes Land, and to the east and west of Prydz Bay. These are regions where the Southern Antarctic Circumpolar Current Front is along the shelf slope, the Antarctic Slope Front is absent, and Circumpolar Deep Water is present. The effect of seasonal variability in temperature on the descent-ascent cycle tends to enhance the probability of success in regions offshore of Wilkes Land, Queen Maud Land, and the eastern shelf of the Antarctic Peninsula later in the spawning season. The simulations show that success of the descent-ascent cycle is sensitive to initial embryo diameter and larval ascent rate. Initial embryo diameter may provide an additional constraint on success of the descent-ascent cycle, especially in continental shelf waters, where small embryos tend to encounter the bottom before hatching. The circumpolar distributions of simulated embryo hatching depth and larval success show that all regions of the Antarctic are not equal in the ability to support successful completion of the Antarctic krill descent-ascent cycle, which has implications for the overall circum-Antarctic krill distribution and for the development of nutrient and material budgets, especially for Antarctic continental shelf areas.

For somatic growth, empirical estimates of variation are rare because they often require expensive long-term tag-recapture programs. In marine pelagic ecosystems, where many species are difficult to sample and not amenable to tagging studies, researchers have relied on estimating growth from length-frequency distributions. We developed a general approach for estimating growth from observed length-frequency samples by combining kernel density estimates of the length-frequency distribution and the von Bertalanffy growth function. Our approach is conceptually straightforward and easy to implement. We applied the methods to Antarctic krill Euphausia superba collected from the Southern Ocean over a span of 19 yr to document among-year variation in krill growth during the austral summer. Our estimates of growth align closely with existing estimates of growth, but we provide the first estimates of among-year variation in krill growth. We estimate very high among-year variation in growth (annual estimates for a 30 mm krill in the Elephant Island region ranged from 0.00 to 0.17 mm d(-1); mean = 0.073, among-year coefficient of variation approximate to 0.8). We correlated growth rate variation to estimates of ocean chlorophyll but not to other oceanographic indices, contrasting with results from previous studies. The large amount of variation in growth unexplained by environmental covariates has substantial implications for ecosystem management in the Southern Ocean ecosystem.																	0171-8630	1616-1599					2013	481						53	67		10.3354/meps10245							WOS:000318566400005

In the present study, these factors were evaluated in the pelagic Southern Ocean taxa Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) and myctophid fish (Electrona antarctica, Gymnoscopelus braueri and G. nicholsi) to establish a baseline record for future studies. Mercury (Hg) concentrations were also analysed to evaluate its potential impacts on species biochemical performance. E. superba had higher metabolic activity than most of the myctophid species, which may explain the comparatively lower energy reserves found in the former. The activity of antioxidant enzymes showed, generally, a lower level in E. superba than in the myctophid species. The lack of any relationship between Hg concentrations and organisms? antioxidant and biotransformation defence mechanisms indicate that levels of Hg accumulated in the studied species were not high enough to affect their biochemical processes adversely.

Larval stages analyzed included: nauplius I, nauplius II, and metanauplius. Laboratory-reared embryos were spawned by gravid females incubated under three feeding groups: (1) phytoplankton mixture, (2) phytoplankton mixture and minced clam, and (3) phytoplankton mixture, minced clam, and commercial larval food. Hatching success was highest in group 3 (100%), lowest in group 1 (0%), and highly variable in field samples (0-48%). Lipid decreased slightly in embryos during embryonic development, while large decreases in lipid were found during nauplius development. High levels of 18: 2(n-6), 20: 4(n-6), and 22: 6(n-3) observed with group 3 samples coincided with high hatching success in krill embryos. The ratio of 22: 6(n-3)/20: 5(n-3) also correlated to hatching success of embryos. The fatty acid profile of embryos in group 3 was similar to that of the field-collected embryos, reflecting the contribution of the commercial larval food in the maternal diet. In our study, the maternal diet was found to influence the fatty acid composition of embryos and in turn affects the hatching success of krill. Specific polyunsaturated fatty acids appeared to play important roles in embryogenesis in krill.

J	NICOL, S				NICOL, S			A COMPARISON OF ANTARCTIC PETREL (THALASSOICA-ANTARCTICA) DIETS WITH NET SAMPLES OF ANTARCTIC KRILL (EUPHAUSIA-SUPERBA) TAKEN FROM THE PRYDZ BAY-REGION	POLAR BIOLOGY												Samples of the stomach contents of Antarctic petrels (Thalassoica antarctica) were obtained on board ship in the Prydz Bay region of Antarctica from birds which had spontaneously regurgitated. The weight of food and the species composition of the stomach contents were measured. Antarctic krill, Euphausia superba, the sole prey item taken, were compared to krill obtained by nets in the same region as part of a large-scale krill survey. Krill from petrel stomach samples were larger in mean size than those sampled by nets. This may be attributed to selection of the larger sized krill by the petrels, it may be caused by the nets sampling different populations of krill or it may be due to net avoidance by the larger krill.																	0722-4060					AUG	1993	13	6					399	403		10.1007/BF01681981							WOS:A1993LR72400005

A combination of affinity chromatography (Con A-Sepharose), gel filtration (Superose 6) and fast protein liquid chromatography (Mono Q) was used for the purification. The hyaluronidase activity was determined by a radial diffusion method based on hyaluronic acid incorporated into an agarose gel. Moreover, the beta-glucuronidase and endo-(1,3)-beta-D-glucanase activities were also followed through the process using phenolphtalein mono beta-glucuronic acid and laminarin as substrates. After the final purification step on Mono Q column, the chromatogram showed three main peaks designated A, B and C. Peak C contained high hyaluronidase activity undetectable in peak A and B. The beta-glucuronidase activity was associated with peak A, while the endo-(1,3)-beta-D-glucanase activity was found in peak B and slight in peak C. The hyaluronidase was purified about 85-fold. It had a pH optimum of 5.3, a temperature optimum of 37-degrees-C and a molecular weight of 80 000 Daltons. On polyacrylamide gradient gel electrophoresis the enzyme fraction showed one major band associated with hyaluronic acid decomposition, slightly contaminated with a few other components. Isoelectric focusing in combination with a hyaluronic acid zymogram demonstrated one major band at pH 6.7 with high enzyme activity. Preliminary data on enzyme specificity suggest that krill hyaluronidase is a new endo-beta-glucuronidase and support the concept of krill enzymes as a remarkable and unusually effective digestive system adapted to the Antarctic marine ecosystem.																	0722-4060					DEC	1991	11	7					501	507									WOS:A1991GU47800011

Nanoplastics affect moulting and faecal pellet sinking in Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) juveniles	ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL												Plastic debris has been identified as a potential threat to Antarctic marine ecosystems, however, the impact of nanoplastics (< 1 mu m) is currently unexplored. Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) is a keystone species of Southern Ocean pelagic ecosystems, which plays a central role in the Antarctic food webs and carbon (C) cycle. Krill has been shown to rapidly fragment microplastic beads through the digestive system, releasing nanoplastics with unknown toxicological effects. Here we exposed krill juveniles to carboxylic (-COOH, anionic) and amino(-NH2, cationic) polystyrene nanoparticles (PS NPs) and we investigated lethal and sub-lethal endpoints after 48 h. The analysis of PS NP suspensions in Antarctic sea water (SW) media showed that PS-COOH formed large agglomerates (1043 +/- 121 nm), while PS-NH2 kept their nominal size (56.8 +/- 3 nm) during the exposure time. After 48 h, no mortality was found but increase in exuviae production (12.6 +/- 1.3%) and reduced swimming activity were observed in juveniles exposed to PS-NH2. The microbial community composition in SW supports the release of krill moults upon PS NP exposure and stimulates further research on the pivotal role of krill in shaping Southern Ocean bacterial assemblages. The presence of fluorescent signal in krill faecal pellets (FPs) confirmed the waterborne ingestion and egestion of PS-COOH at 48 h of exposure. Changes in FP structure and properties were also associated to the incorporation of PS NPs regardless of their surface charge. The effects of PS NPs on krill FP properties were compared to Control 0 h as a reference for full FPs (plastic vs food) and Control 48 h as a reference for more empty-like FPs (plastic vs lack of food). Exposure to PS NPs led to a FP sinking rate comparable to Control 48 h, but significantly lower than Control 0 h (58.40 +/- 23.60 m/d and 51.23 +/- 28.60 m/d for PS-COOH and PS-NH2; 168.80 +/- 74.58 m/d for Control 0 h). Considering the important role played by krill in the food web and C export in the Southern Ocean, the present study provides cues about the potential impact of nanoplastics on Antarctic pelagic ecosystems and their biogeochemical cycles.

Growth rate was measured using an 'instantaneous growth rate' technique which involved measuring the mean change in length of the uropods at moulting. In the first 4 d following collection mean growth rates ranged from 0.35 to 7.34 % per moult in adults and 2.42 to 9.05 % in juveniles. Mean growth rates of adult and juvenile krill differed between areas and between the different years of the investigation. When food was restricted under experimental conditions, individual krill began to shrink immediately and mean population growth rates decreased gradually, becoming negative after as little as 7 d. Populations of krill which exhibited higher initial growth rates began to shrink later than those which had initially been growing more slowly.																	0171-8630					NOV	1992	89	2-3					175	181		10.3354/meps089175							WOS:A1992KH34600007

Activities were compared with the digestive enzymes protease. cellulase (1,4-beta-D-glucanase) and laminarinase (1,3-beta-D-glucanase). The chlorophyll and protein contents in the surface water of the corresponding stations were determined. Enzyme activities were characterized by high individual and spatial variations. Chitinolytic activity in the stomach correlated well with all digestive enzymes investigated. In the midgut gland, a correlation with cellulase and laminarinase was evident. The amount of chlorophyll a and phytoplankton protein in the surface water was not correlated with enzyme activity. Specific enzyme activity was higher in the stomach than in the midgut gland. showing individual ratios for each enzyme. Elevated endochitinase activity in the stomach suggests that chitinous food is digested to oligomers in the stomach, while the subsequent degradation to amino sugars occurs predominantly in the midgut gland.

The eyestalks from 51 individuals were dissected, cut in longitudinal sections and studied for identifying growth zones. The krill was collected at the South Orkney Islands during January and February 2015, and varied between 30 and 53 mm in total body length. Up to six growth zones were identified, each zone consisting of one light and one dark section. The width of the longitudinal sections increased with increasing body length, although there were differences between sexes. Females tended to have narrower growth zones from the third zone and onwards compared with males. Data show that male subadult stages (MIIA1, MIIA2 and MIIA3) had 2.2 +/- 0.8 (average +/- SD) zones and adult male stages had 3.8 +/- 0.8 zones. The female juvenile stage (FHB) had 1.7 +/- 0.5 zones and adult females (FIIIA-E) had 3.7 +/- 1.0 zones. There were positive relationships between the number of zones and the maturity stage, and between the number of zones and body length. Further knowledge about molting process in the Antarctic krill and a verification of the ageing procedure from krill with a known age is needed before the number of growth zones can be definitely established as an indicator of age. The detection of growth zones in the Antarctic krill will be an important contribution to the understanding of the biology of the species if the zones actually represent annual growth.																	0278-0372	1937-240X				MAY	2016	36	3					267	273		10.1163/1937240X-00002428							WOS:000376055900001						
J	Zhu, GP; Deng, B; Zhang, HT; Yang, QY				Zhu, Guoping; Deng, Bo; Zhang, Haiting; Yang, Qingyuan			Ontogenetic and temporal diet variation in adult Antarctic krill Euphausia superba at South Georgia during austral winter revealed by stable isotope analysis	FISHERIES RESEARCH												Understanding the ontogenetic and temporal shifts in krill diet during winter is crucial to elucidate the over wintering of krill in the Southern Ocean. Stable isotope analyses (N-15/N-14 and C-13/C-12) were utilized to explore the variation in diet of adult krill with size and month during the winter season (June to September 2016) at the South Georgia. Stable isotope signatures indicated that there were no significant differences in delta C-13 and delta N-15 values between sexes of krill. Nitrogen isotope signatures suggested increasing carnivory with size of adults throughout winter. Carbon isotope signatures revealed reduced food sources for the larger adults during early winter, but all adults could feed on similar food items during middle to late winter. The trophic niche of adults was similar during the winter season at the South Georgia. Our results provide insight for the diet of adult krill in the food-limited season and should be useful in understanding the energy transfer in the marine food web in the South Georgia ecosystem. Moreover, the information derived from this study can also be used to support krill fishery management and understand the interaction between krill population, top predators and fishery.

A chromatographic protocol was developed that allowed complete separation of the two enzyme forms, named NAGase B and NAGase C. The latter was purified to homogeneity with 600-fold enrichment and a yield of 17%. The molecular mass was 150 kDa. NAGase B showed characteristics of a glycoprotein due to affinity towards concanavalin A sepharose, while NAGase C did not. Highly specific polyclonal antibodies to NAGase C [anti-(E. superba-NAGase C)-IgG] showed only negligible cross-reactivity with NAGase B isoforms. A comparison with the Northern krill, Meganyctiphanes norvegica,revealed a corresponding chromatographic pattern with two main activity peaks, for differentiation named NAGase II and NAGase III. Application of the antibody on M. norvegica revealed a high specificity toward NAGase III and a low cross-reactivity with NAGase II. First indication is given that the two forms are no isoenzymes in a strict sense but instead may have different functions in the metabolism of krill. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Inc.

Bengtson			Aqueous uptake and sublethal toxicity of p,p '-DDE in non-feeding larval stages of Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba)	ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION												This study evaluated the toxicological sensitivity of non-feeding larval stages of a key Antarctic species (Antarctic krill, Euphausia superba) to p,p'-dichlorodiphenyl dichloroethylene (p,p'-DDE) exposure. The aqueous uptake clearance rate of 84 mL g(-1) preserved weight (p.w.) h(-1) determined for p,p'-DDE in Antarctic krill larvae is comparable to previous findings for small cold water crustaceans and five times slower than the rates reported for an amphipod inhabiting warmer waters. Natural variations in larval physiology appear to influence contaminant uptake and larval krill behavioural responses, strongly highlighting the importance of time of measurement for ecotoxicological testing. Sublethal narcosis (immobility) was observed in larval Antarctic krill from p,p'-DDE body residues of 0.2 mmol/kg p.w., which is in agreement with findings for adult krill and temperate aquatic species. The finding of comparable body residue-based toxicity of p,p'-DDE between polar and temperate species supports the tissue residue approach for environmental risk assessment of polar ecosystems.

However, its application as a novel food ingredient has not yet been fully explored. This review summarizes the chemical composition, extraction technologies, potential health benefits, and current applications of krill oil, with the aim of providing suggestions for its exploitation. Krill oil is a unique lipid consisting of diverse lipid classes and is characterized by a high concentration (39.29% to 80.69%) of phospholipids (PLs) associated with eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). It also contains considerable amounts of bioactive minor components such as astaxanthin, sterols, tocopherols, vitamin A, flavonoids, and minerals. The current technologies used in krill oil production are solvent extraction, nonsolvent extraction, super/subcritical fluid extraction, and enzyme-assisted pretreatment extraction, which all greatly influence the yield and quality of the end-product. In addition, krill oil has been documented to have various health benefits, including anti-inflammatory effects, cardiovascular disease (CVD) prevention, women's health, neuroprotection, and anticancer activities. Although krill oil products used for dietary supplements have been commercially available, few studies have attempted to explore the underlying molecular mechanisms to elucidate how exactly the krill oil exerts different biological activities. Further studies should focus on this to improve the development of krill oil products for human consumption.

Variations in the biomass of Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) around the South Shetland Islands, 1996-2006	ICES JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE												The time-series of acoustically surveyed Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) biomass near the South Shetland Islands (SSI) between 1996 and 2006 is re-estimated using a validated physics-based model of target strength (TS), and a species-discrimination algorithm based on the length-range of krill in plankton samples to identify krill acoustically, derived from TS-model predictions. The SSI area is surveyed each austral summer by the US Antarctic Marine Living Resources Program, and the acoustic data are used to examine trends in krill biomass and to assess the potential impact of fishing to the reproductive success of land-based predators (seals and penguins). The time-series of recomputed biomass densities varies greatly from that computed using an empirical log-linear TS-model and fixed-ranges of differences in volume-backscattering strengths (Delta S-v), conventionally used to identify krill acoustically. The new acoustic estimates of biomass are significantly correlated with both proportional recruitment and krill abundance estimated from zooplankton samples. Two distinct peaks in biomass (1996 and 2003) are in accord with recruitment events shown by net-based krill time-series. The foundation for the new TS-model and the associated krill-discrimination algorithm, coupled with the agreement between acoustic- and net-survey results, provides strong support for the use of the new analytical technique. Variable biases in the re-estimated krill biomass have been greatly reduced. However, survey variability increased as a result of the increased rejection of acoustic backscatter previously attributed to krill. Management of Southern Ocean krill stocks based on a precautionary approach may therefore result in decreased allocations of krill, given its dependence on the variability of survey estimates.																	1054-3139					MAY	2008	65	4					497	508		10.1093/icesjms/fsn033							WOS:000255816900001

Our major observations are: (1) respiration rates were reduced by 30 to 50% in autumn and winter, compared to values in late spring; (2) feeding activity was reduced by 80 to 86% in autumn and winter, compared to late spring, at similar food concentrations; (3) feeding was omnivorous during winter; (4) with each moult, krill grew by 0.5 to 3.8%, in length; (5) body lipids and, to a small extent, body proteins were consumed during winter. Adult Euphausia superba thus adopt metabolic slowdown and omnivorous feeding activity at low rates to survive the winter season in the Lazarev Sea. By mid autumn, metabolic activity is reduced, most likely being influenced by the Antarctic light regime, which is accompanied by a reduction in feeding activity and growth. Although at a low level, the feeding activity during winter seems to provide an important energy input.

Two groups were fed with the chitinous diatom Cyclotella cryptica and the non-chitinous green algae Dunaliella bioculata, respectively. A control group remained unfed. The time courses of the activities of endo- and exochitinase in the stomach and the midgut gland were compared with those of the digestive enzymes protease, cellulase (1,4-beta-D-glucanase) and laminarinase (1,3-beta-D-glucanase). Specific activities of all enzymes were higher in the stomach than in the midgut gland. Characteristic time courses of activity were evident after 4 days. In starved animals, enzyme activities decreased to a minimum after 4 days and recovered within 14 days to initial values. In the stomach, the activities of endo- and exochitinase increased when krill were fed on Cyclotella. For animals fed with Dunaliella, activities stayed constant or decreased slightly. The results confirm chitinases as digestive enzymes and, therefore, the capability of krill to utilize various food sources.

Incorrect growth models, specifically those giving unrealistically high production, could lead to over-exploitation of the krill population if those models are used in setting catch limits. Here we review available approaches to modelling productivity and note that existing models do not account for the interactions between growth and reproduction and variable environmental conditions. We develop a new energetics moult-cycle (EMC) model which combines energetics and the constraints on growth of the moult-cycle. This model flexibly accounts for regional, inter- and intra-annual variation in temperature, food supply, and day length. The EMC model provides results consistent with the general expectations for krill growth in length and mass, including having thin krill, as well as providing insights into the effects that increasing temperature may have on growth and reproduction. We recommend that this new model be incorporated into assessments of catch limits for Antarctic krill.

The carapace matters: refinement of the instantaneous growth rate method for Antarctic krill Euphausia superba Dana, 1850 (Euphausiacea)	JOURNAL OF CRUSTACEAN BIOLOGY												Growth of Antarctic krill Euphausia superba Dana, 1850 is commonly calculated using the Instantaneous Growth Rate (IGR) method based on the difference between the uropod lengths of the moulted exoskeleton and the uropod lengths after moulting. To date, this method has not accounted for sex-dependent differences in body proportion, relying only upon uropod measurements. We measured the carapace, uropod, and total body lengths of gravid females, non-gravid females, males, and juvenile krill from the Indian Sector of the Southern Ocean. Growth rates derived using a combination of the carapace and uropod measurements for gravid females were different from those derived through the traditional uropod-only based IGR, whereas non-gravid females, male, and juvenile growth rates showed no significant difference between methods. The refined method we propose successfully reflects dimorphism in growth between the sexes of krill, with gravid females having enlarged carapaces during the reproductive season. The interaction between growth and reproduction must be considered to improve the reliability of predictions from krill life history models, which is possible through the use of sex-dependent IGR measurements. We propose that, whenever possible, measurements of carapace and total length should be made along with uropod measurements. Together with assessments of maturity stages of krill that did not moult during experiments, these measurements will aid in further informing krill stock assessments.

Interannual variability in Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) density at South Georgia, Southern Ocean: 1997-2013	ICES JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE												Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) are a key species in Southern Ocean ecosystems, maintaining very large numbers of predators, and fluctuations in their abundance can affect the overall structure and functioning of the ecosystems. The interannual variability in the abundance and biomass of krill was examined using a 17-year time-series of acoustic observations undertaken in the Western Core Box (WCB) survey area to the northwest of South Georgia, Southern Ocean. Krill targets were identified in acoustic data using a multifrequency identification window and converted to krill density using the Stochastic Distorted-Wave Born Approximation target strength model. Krill density ranged over several orders of magnitude (0-10 000 g m(-2)) and its distribution was highly skewed with many zero observations. Within each survey, the mean krill density was significantly correlated with the top 7% of the maximum krill densities observed. Hence, only the densest krill swarms detected in any one year drove the mean krill density estimates for the WCB in that year. WCB krill density (mu, mean density for the area) showed several years (1997/1998, 2001-2003, 2005-2007) of high values (mu, 30 g m(-2)) interspersed with years (1999/2000, 2004, 2009/2010) of low density (mu, 30 g m(-2)). This pattern showed three different periods, with fluctuations every 4-5 years. Cross correlation analyses of variability in krill density with current and lagged indices of ocean (sea surface temperature, SST and El Nino/Southern Oscillation) and atmospheric variability (Southern Annular Mode) found the highest correlation between krill density and winter SST (August SST) from the preceding year. A quadratic regression (r(2) = 0.42, p < 0.05) provides a potentially valuable index for forecasting change in this ecosystem.

Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), nutritionally important lipid components with poor oxidative stability, were used as markers of oxidation during thermal processing of Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) meal by evaluating the lipolysis, lipid oxidation, and non-enzymatic browning reactions. RESULTLiquid chromatography-mass spectrometry of the phospholipids and the main oxidation products of free fatty acids and phosphatidylcholine (PC) was effective for evaluating the oxidation of EPA and DHA. During boiling, oxidation of EPA and DHA in the free fatty acid and PC fractions and hydrolysis of the fatty acids at the sn-2 position of the phospholipids were predominant. The changes in PC during drying were mainly attributed to the oxidation of EPA and DHA. Heat treatment increased the oxidation products and concentration of hydrophobic pyrrole owing to pyrrolization between phosphatidylethanolamine and the lipid oxidation products. CONCLUSIONThe lipid oxidation level of Antarctic krill increased after drying, owing to prolonged heating under the severe conditions.

J	Hewitt, RP; Demer, DA				Hewitt, RP; Demer, DA			The use of acoustic sampling to estimate the dispersion and abundance of euphausiids, with an emphasis on Antarctic krill, Euphausia superba	FISHERIES RESEARCH												Acoustic sampling has been used to investigate the ecology of Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) and to provide information on dispersion and abundance necessary to manage their harvest. Population estimates based on multi-ship acoustic surveys have been used to set catch limits. More localized acoustic surveys have been conducted to study the response of land-breeding krill predators to local variations in their food supply. These and future surveys may result in additional controls on the fishery. In this context, the use of acoustics to survey euphausiids is reviewed and major sources of uncertainty are discussed. These issues are organized as they pertain to the two broad steps of acoustic surveys: (1) estimating the volumetric density of krill (measurement uncertainty) and (2) mapping krill distribution and estimating abundance (sampling uncertainty).

Diet of the Antarctic starry skate Amblyraja georgiana (Rajidae, (Chondrichthyes) at South Georgia (Southern Ocean)	POLAR BIOLOGY												Stomach contents were identified from 206 Antarctic starry skate (Amblyraja georgiana) that were collected during three groundfish surveys (September 2007, April 2008 and January 2009) at South Georgia, Southern Ocean. The diet of A. georgiana varied with skate size and between years. Preferred prey included fish particularly for larger individuals) and Antarctic krill, Euphausia superba, as well as amphipods, polychaetes and other benthic fauna. The skate A. georgiana appears to be an opportunistic predator, and the clear presence of Antarctic krill in this demersal predator's diet may indicate a benthic habit of this euphausiid species, which has hitherto mainly been considered as occupying a purely pelagic niche.

We examined the effects of various diets on the fatty acid composition of larval, juvenile, and adult E. superba collected in April 1999 in the southwest Lazarev Sea and in April 2001 in the Bellingshausen Sea. Specimens were fed four different diets (mixed phytoplankton, mixed ice algae, the ice diatom Fragilariopsis cylindrus, and mixed copepod assemblages) or starved for up to 44 d. Total lipid content, lipid classes, and fatty acid composition showed very little variation in juvenile and adult krill with the different feeding regimes. Furcilia lipids were much more strongly influenced by the fatty acid signatures of their food. No stage-specific food preferences were detected in the larvae, and spatial patterns were mirrored by all furcilia stages. Comparison of the fatty acid profiles of the offered food with those of the subsequently excreted feces indicated preferential assimilation of polyunsaturated fatty acids by E superba.

Spatial variability in total and organic mercury levels in Antarctic krill Euphausia superba across the Scotia Sea	ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION												Total and organic mercury concentrations were determined for males, females and juveniles of Euphausia superba collected at three discrete locations in the Scotia Sea (South Orkney Islands, South Georgia and Antarctic Polar Front) to assess spatial mercury variability in Antarctic krill. There was clear geographic differentiation in mercury concentrations, with specimens from the South Orkney Islands having total mercury concentrations 5 to 7 times higher than Antarctic krill from South Georgia and the Antarctic Polar Front. Mercury did not appear to accumulate with life-stage since juveniles had higher concentrations of total mercury (0.071 mu g g(-1) from South Orkney Islands; 0.014 mu g g(-1) from South Georgia) than adults (0.054 mu g g(-1) in females and 0.048 mu g g(-1) in males from South Orkney Islands; 0.006 mu g g(-1) in females and 0.007 mu g g(-1) in males from South Georgia). Results suggest that females may use egg laying as a mechanism to excrete mercury, with eggs having higher concentrations than the corresponding somatic tissue. Organic mercury makes up a minor percentage of total mercury (15-37%) with the percentage being greater in adults than in juveniles. When compared to euphausiids from other parts of the world, the concentration of mercury in Antarctic krill is within the same range, or higher, highlighting the global distribution of this contaminant. Given the high potential for biomagnification of mercury through food webs, concentrations in Antarctic krill may have deleterious effects on long-lived Antarctic krill predators.

Krill were collected with a 10m(2) MOCNESS trawl during four cruises (November 1999, February, May, November 2000). RNA:DNA mirrored the chlorophyll a concentration, with the highest values found during seasons of abundant phytoplankton. Activities of the glycolytic enzyme lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and the mitochondrial enzyme citrate synthase (CS) were significantly higher in male krill when compared to females of similar size, indicating that their burst and aerobic swimming performance may be higher than females throughout the year. RNA:DNA ratio and enzyme activities were highly elevated in summer as compared to the earliest spring sampling period. Krill showed significant seasonal changes in LDH activity, with lowest values in spring and highest values in summer (females) or autumn (males). Krill showed significant seasonal changes in CS activity with highest values in summer. Protein and % water varied significantly among seasons for both males and females. Lower CS activity and RNA:DNA ratio suggest krill exhibit reduced metabolism during the winter when phytoplankton production is reduced, perhaps enhancing survival. Lower enzyme activities in female krill in early spring suggest they may achieve greater metabolic suppression during overwintering. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

In the population, from the Gullmarsfjord (west coast of Sweden), LDH was encoded for by two different Ldh-A* and -B* loci. The isoenzymes were named according to their electrophoretic mobilities. Ldh-A* locus was polymorphic. The allelic frequencies were a = 0.99, a' = 0.002, a'' = 0.004, a''' = 0.004. The level of LDH polymorphism is low. Most individuals possess the same amount of two LDH homopolymers (LDH-A*(4) and LDH-B*(4)). The Meganyctiphanes norvegica LDH-A*(4) and LDH-B*(4) isoenzymes and the predominant LDH-A*(4) isoenzyme from Euphausia superba were purified to specific activities of 294, 306 and 464 mu mol NADH min(-1) mg(-1), respectively. In both species the LDH isoenzymes were separated by chromatofocusing. All three isoenzymes are L-specific tetramers with molecular weight of approximately 160 kDa. Northern krill LDH-A*(4) has higher affinity for pyruvate and lactate and is more thermostable than LDH-B*(4). Both isoenzymes are inhibited significantly by high concentration of pyruvate but not lactate. Antarctic krill isoenzyme exhibits high substrate affinities, high NAD inhibition, high inhibition at 10 mM pyruvate, lack of lactate inhibition, and high heat stability and resembles northern krill LDH-A*(4) isoenzyme.

Antarctic krill Euphausia superba: spatial distribution, abundance, and management of fisheries in a changing climate	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												Antarctic krill Euphausia superba, a keystone species in the Southern Ocean, is highly relevant for studying effects of climate-related shifts on management systems. Krill provides a key link between primary producers and higher trophic levels and supports the largest regional fishery. Any major perturbation in the krill population would have severe ecological and economic ramifications. We review the literature to determine how climate change, in concert with other environmental changes, alters krill habitat, affects spatial distribution/abundance, and impacts fisheries management. Findings recently reported on the effects of climate change on krill distribution and abundance are inconsistent, however, raising questions regarding methods used to detect changes in density and biomass. One recent study reported a sharp decline in krill densities near their northern limit, accompanied by a poleward contraction in distribution in the Southwest Atlantic sector. Another recent study found no evidence of long-term decline in krill density or biomass and reported no evidence of a poleward shift in distribution. Moreover, with predicted decreases in phytoplankton production, vertical foraging migrations to the seabed may become more frequent, also impacting krill production and harvesting. Potentially cumulative impacts of climate change further compound the management challenge faced by CCAMLR, the organization responsible for conservation of Antarctic marine living resources: to detect changes in the abundance, distribution, and reproductive performance of krill and krill-dependent predator stocks and to respond to such change by adjusting its conservation measures. Based on CCAMLR reports and documents, we review the institutional framework, outline how climate change has been addressed within this organization, and examine the prospects for further advances toward ecosystem risk assessment and an adaptive management system.

Increased Feeding and Nutrient Excretion of Adult Antarctic Krill, Euphausia superba, Exposed to Enhanced Carbon Dioxide (CO2)	PLOS ONE												Ocean acidification has a wide-ranging potential for impacting the physiology and metabolism of zooplankton. Sufficiently elevated CO2 concentrations can alter internal acid-base balance, compromising homeostatic regulation and disrupting internal systems ranging from oxygen transport to ion balance. We assessed feeding and nutrient excretion rates in natural populations of the keystone species Euphausia superba (Antarctic krill) by conducting a CO2 perturbation experiment at ambient and elevated atmospheric CO2 levels in January 2011 along the West Antarctic Peninsula (WAP). Under elevated CO2 conditions (similar to 672 ppm), ingestion rates of krill averaged 78 mu g C individual(-1) d(-1) and were 3.5 times higher than krill ingestion rates at ambient, present day CO2 concentrations. Additionally, rates of ammonium, phosphate, and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) excretion by krill were 1.5, 1.5, and 3.0 times higher, respectively, in the high CO2 treatment than at ambient CO2 concentrations. Excretion of urea, however, was similar to 17% lower in the high CO2 treatment, suggesting differences in catabolic processes of krill between treatments. Activities of key metabolic enzymes, malate dehydrogenase (MDH) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), were consistently higher in the high CO2 treatment. The observed shifts in metabolism are consistent with increased physiological costs associated with regulating internal acid-base equilibria. This represents an additional stress that may hamper growth and reproduction, which would negatively impact an already declining krill population along the WAP.				schofield, oscar/H-4169-2018	schofield, oscar/0000-0003-2359-4131												1932-6203					DEC 26	2012	7	12							e52224	10.1371/journal.pone.0052224							WOS:000313618800060	23300621

Improving methodology and predicting intermolt period	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												The growth rates of postlarval krill (Euphausia superba) were measured across a wide range of environments in the Scotia Sea and around South Georgia using the Instantaneous Growth Rate (IGR) method. Each IGR experiment determined the intermolt period (IMP) and growth increment at molt (GI) of an average of 120 individuals incubated for 5 d in through-flowing ambient, filtered seawater. We examined the results from 51 IGR experiments involving 5,927 animals ranging between 25 mm and 62 mm. Animals were collected from an area that covered a latitudinal range of 10 degrees and surface temperatures of between -0.85 degrees C and 4.75 degrees C. The measurement of IMP has rarely been achieved in IGR experiments because synchronous molting biases estimates. We overcame this by applying a binary logistic regression model to Our data. This related IMP to temperature, body length, and Maturity stage. Food did not influence IMP. Our model estimated that krill within Our experiments had IMPs ranging from 9 d to 57 d. Temperature affected the IMP of females more than that of males. The IMPs of females were shortest around 2 degrees C and increased at lower and higher temperatures. IMP increased with body size and altered according to gender, with male IMPs being 50% longer than those of equivalently sized females. One of the main assumptions of the IGR method is that the GI measured in the first few days reflects the in situ conditions experienced by krill in the previous intermolt period. However, we found that the GIs declined immediately and rapidly after capture, particularly when growth was initially high. Thus, conditions at time of molt also influence GI. We developed a method of correcting measured GIs to natural growth in field conditions. These refinements to IGR methodology (IMP and GI estimation) enable more accurate and precise predictions of krill growth rates in Summer to be made.

The diet of Antarctic krill in the Prydz Bay during austral summer of 2012/2013 was investigated and the ontogenetic shift in krill diet was evaluated using the stable isotope method. The nitrogen stable isotope values (delta N-15) of adults ((2.78 +/- 0.58)aEuro degrees) were much higher than those of juveniles ((1.69 +/- 0.70)aEuro degrees), whereas the carbon stable isotope values (delta C-13) of adults (-(28.26 +/- 1.08)aEuro degrees) were slightly lower than those of juveniles (-(27.48 +/- 1.35)aEuro degrees). Particulate organic matter (POM) from 0, 25, and 50 m depth combined (0/25/50 m) represented phytoplankton food items. The results showed that phytoplankton food items in surface water and mesozooplankton were two essential food items for Antarctic krill in the Prydz Bay during summer. POM (0/25/50 m) contributes 56%-69% and 26%-34% to the diet of juvenile and adult krill, respectively, whereas mesozooplankton composes 13%-34% and 58%-71% of the diet of juvenile and adult krill, respectively. Thus, an ontogenetic diet shift from POM (0/25/50 m), which consists mainly of phytoplankton, to a higher trophic level diet containing mesozooplankton, was detected. The capacity for adults to consume more zooplankton food items may minimize their food competition with juveniles, which rely mostly on phytoplankton food items. This suggests "diet shift with ontogeny" which may somehow help krill keep their dietary energy budget balanced and well adapted to the Antarctic marine ecosystem as a dominant species.																	0253-505X	1869-1099				DEC	2017	36	12					67	78		10.1007/s13131-017-1049-4							WOS:000417883300009

Here, we present a new method for examining such interactions using the results from an acoustic survey of krill availability to foraging penguins. Analyses of fine-scale krill distributions within a 1852 x 1852 x 50 m volume of ocean revealed substantial prey patchiness in all dimensions. Our survey detected the presence of at least 6 krill aggregations in the survey area. The surface distribution of penguins was associated with the edges of these aggregations and was nonrandomly associated with krill densities above 0.1 krill m(-3) in the 30 to 40 m depth layer. The latter association was masked when krill abundance was integrated over the entire water column. Given that mean daytime dive depths for chinstrap penguins fall between 30 and 40 m, our data suggest penguins may fail to detect or choose to pass by shallow, denser prey aggregations and successfully forage on deeper, more homogeneously distributed krill offering higher encounter probabilities per unit volume searched. These findings reveal biologically important features of prey patchiness that cannot be addressed within the limitations of a primarily 2-dimensional analysis of predator-prey distributions. We emphasize that if we hope to gain a predictive understanding of the foraging behavior of diving predators, then we must consider fine-scale, 3-dimensional patterns of prey patchiness when assessing the availability of prey to diving predators.																	0171-8630					FEB	1996	131	1-3					1	10		10.3354/meps131001							WOS:A1996TZ66300001						
J	Lorda, JF; Ceccaldi, HJ				Farber Lorda, Jaime; Ceccaldi, Hubert J.			Relationship of morphometrics, total carotenoids, and total lipids with activity and sexual and spatial features in Euphausia superba	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS												Morphological differences associated with sex or stage, together with total lipids and carotenoids, were studied in Euphausia superba as possible indicators of physiological condition. E. superba displays sexual dimorphism during growth. A group of mature males, called Males II herein, has a greater abdominal length, suggesting that they are faster swimmers, a feature implying higher metabolic rates and a higher demand for protecting pigments like carotenoids. Mature Males II have proportionally lower lipids but higher total lipid-soluble carotenoids, a counterintuitive finding. Males II also have bigger eyes. Significant regressions with carotenoids were found for wet weight, abdominal length, and eye diameter. On a spatial analysis, population composition reflects reproductive activity. Males II would be in search of females for fecundation and, thus, are dominant in some areas. The PCA analysis of 10 allometric and biochemical variables show a distinct Males II group differing in morphology, carotenoids, and lipid contents. The carotenoid:lipid ratio was highest for Males II, supporting the hypothesis of the role of carotenoids in the activity of the species. Mature males may experience physiological stress during reproduction and probably die shortly afterwards. A relationship between activity, morphometrics, and carotenoid content seems evident, deserving further investigation.Y																	2045-2322					AUG 6	2020	10	1							13177	10.1038/s41598-020-69780-8							WOS:000573233300006	32764584

Moulting krill were found in most swarms, but in one swarm all of the krill were just about to moult. Ways in which moulting may act as a possible sorting mechanism are discussed. Data for all the analysed krill (ca. 3000 specimens) were used to investigate the interdependence of moult rate, sexual maturation and growth. While all immature krill moulted at approximately the same rate in the study, there were significant differences in the moulting rates of mature male and female krill. Gravid female krill continued to moult, although less frequently than mature males. As a con sequence males had to attach spermatophores to females after each moult. It is likely that variation in moult rate of females and males was related to the energy expenditure required for ovary development in females and spermatophore production and searching behaviour in males. Spawning and moulting were only partly coupled in gravid females. Spawning appeared to take place predominantly during Moult Stage D-2. There was no evidence of intermoult growth by intersegmental dilation.																	0025-3162					DEC	1996	127	2					201	208		10.1007/BF00942104							WOS:A1996WH77200003

Understanding fishery-induced stress levels and the recovery period of escapees is therefore crucial for predicting total fishing-induced mortality. Hemolymph lactate concentration is commonly used as an index of physiological stress in many crustacean species, and the clearing time of lactate back to normal levels indicates the ability to recover from stress. We measured the hemolymph lactate concentration in three groups of Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba Dana, 1850): Group 1, trawl escapees collected during fishing; Group 2, specimens subjected to simulated mesh penetration; and Group 3, an onboard acclimated control group. Individuals that had escaped the trawl during fishing had the highest concentrations of hemolymph lactate (mean > 6 mmol-l). Exposure to mesh penetration was in itself not stressful, as hemolymph lactate concentrations did not differ significantly between Group 2 and the control Group (mean 0.8 mmol-l versus 0.7 mmol-l, respectively). Additional stress factors during the capture and handling process likely added to the elevated lactate levels observed in Group 1. For the trawl escapees, the lactate clearance time during stress recovery was modeled as a function of exponential decay. Hemolymph lactate levels did not differ significantly among the three groups after 200 min, which suggested that Antarctic krill recovered from fishery-induced stress within this time period.

Recruitment of Antarctic krill Euphausia superba in the South Georgia region: adult fecundity and the fate of larvae	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												The high concentration of adult Antarctic krill Euphausia superba Dana around South Georgia, Antarctica, is a product of immigration and not local recruitment. We investigated whether reproduction and early larval development are the cause of local recruitment failure. It was found that the majority of adult females were reproductively active in summer and that there was a comparatively high investment in the ovary, reaching up to 46% of the total wet weight of the krill. The corresponding egg batches were amongst the largest ever reported for E. superba. A semi-empirical model predicted that 11% of females completed just 1 spawning episode per year, 60% completed 2, and 29% completed 3 or more. On average, a South Georgian krill released 12 343 eggs yr(-1). The eggs were unable to complete the descent-ascent developmental cycle on-shelf because the bathymetry was too shallow but, off-shelf, they were predicted to sink to between 490 and 520 m and return to the surface either as a metanauplius or 1st calyptopis stage with plenty of energy reserves remaining. Feeding conditions were adequate for the development of later larval stages once these reserves were exhausted. Although net surveys found calyptopis and early stage furcilia in the vicinity of South Georgia, numbers were mostly lower than predicted. Overall, reproduction or early stage development are successful in this region, leaving predation on larvae and advective export during winter as the main potential causes of local recruitment failure.

J	Zhu, GP; Yang, Y; Song, Q; Zhang, HT				Zhu, Guoping; Yang, Yang; Song, Qi; Zhang, Haiting			Precision of growth band determination from eyestalk sections of Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) preserved in formalin	FISHERIES RESEARCH												Age information for commercial fish species is crucial to fishery management. Age information for Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) will be important for stock assessment modeling and future feedback management of krill fisheries. Samples stored in 70% ethanol provide an opportunity to detect the growth bands of eyestalk sections. Moreover, information derived from samples preserved in formalin will have a greater impact on the feedback management process because this preservation method was more common in previous decades. Out of 162 Antarctic krill individuals preserved in 5% formalin, the growth bands from eyestalk sections of 134 samples were readable. The relationship between the total length and the growth bands in the eyestalk was analyzed. Three main parameters, including exact percent agreement (EPA), coefficient of variation (CV), and average percentage error (APE), were used to evaluate the precision of the growth bands. Results show decreased CV and APE values and an increase in the EPA value with the accumulation of reading runs. This method is direct and uses a grinding and polishing technique before reading, contrary to Krafft et al. (2016) and Kilada et al. (2017). Combined with published studies, specimens collected from autumn to winter in this study can provide a better understanding of Antarctic krill growth. This study presents important information for age determination, particularly for specimens preserved in formalin, and will benefit the stock assessment and acoustic estimation of this species in the future. Further studies are required to validate the correlation between growth bands and age. Additionally, more samples from different seasons and regions are also needed to fully understand the growth dynamics of this species.

The purified ACE inhibitory peptide was identified to be Ile-Pro-Ile-Lys with a molecular weight of 470.3 Da by LC-MS/MS. The IC50 value of Ile-Pro-Ile-Lys was 57.4 mu M. Lineweaver-Burk plots suggest that Ile-Pro-IleLys acts as a non-competitive inhibitor against ACE. Oral administration of Ile-Pro-Ile-Lys significantly (p < 0.05) decreased the systolic blood pressure of spontaneously hypertensive rats. Collectively, an antihypertensive peptide purified from krill protein hydrolysates may be useful as a food ingredient for treatment of hypertension and related diseases.

This study aims to understand the distribution of biomass of zooplankton, especially the krill, using the data collected by net sampling techniques. Total zooplankton biomass for all the sampling stations ranged from 9 to 684 ml/1000 m3 (xBAR: 143.34 +/- 138.61 SD; n = 150). Biomass data grouped by 5-degrees latitude interval shows the presence of higher biomass (xBAR: 191 ml/1000 m3; n=31) in the Antarctic divergence region (between 60-degrees to 65-degrees-S). Euphausiid Euphausia superba DANA formed a considerable component of biomass and together with eggs and larvae represented over 60% (n = 39) of mean total zooplankton-biomass in the coastal ice region. The values for population density and biomass of adult-size krill varied between 0 to 4320 individuals and 6 to 305 ml/1000 m3, respectively. The highest values were recorded between 62-degrees to 69-degrees-S and between 16-degrees to 30-degrees-E. A high density of krill larvae was encountered in the shelf region during January 1987 which was related to chlorophyll concentration. However, the values obtained during six consecutive summers showed that values of adult krill biomass at given location was highly variable and, hence, not comparable on inter-annual basis, during the sampling years.

These were combined with acoustically derived biomass data to calculate the grazing impact of Antarctic krill and its contribution to the carbon flux in the region. Individual levels of gut pigment concentrations and evacuation rates ranged from 27 to 1831 ng chlorophyll a-eq. ind.(-1) and from 0.133 to 0.424 h(-1), respectively. Losses of pigment fluorescence during digestion were very high, ranging from 58 to 98% of the total pigment digested. Daily carbon consumption estimated using the gut fluorescence method varied from 0.234 to 0.931 mg C ind.(-1) day(-1) (or 0.4-1.7% of body carbon), compared to -2.73 mg C ind.(-1) day(-1) (or similar to 5% of body carbon) using the faecal pellet production data. The 3-fold higher daily ration estimated using egestion rate data may be explained by predation on micro- and mesozooplankton. Maximum krill grazing impact ranged from 0.4 to 1.9% of the total phytoplankton stock or from 10 to 59% of the total daily primary production. However, grazing impact on the microphytoplankton (>20 mu m) was substantially higher, at times exceeding 100% of the daily microphytoplankton production. It is suggested that to meet its energetic demands, krill must consume a substantial proportion of heterotrophic carbon.

Median % DE in minke whales (n 5) eating krill of the genus Thysanoessa sp. (energy density (ED) 23.8 kJ/g) was 93 (range 87-93). Median % DE in crabeater seals (n 6) eating krill of the species Euphausia superba (ED 20.8 kJ/g) was 84 (range 79-85), which is significantly lower than the % DE of krill in minke whales (P = 0.008). Since the chemical composition in E. superba and in Thysanoessa sp. is similar, it is suggested that the complex multi-stomached system of minke whales, which contains both chitinase (EC 3.2.1.14)-producing as well as several other types of bacteria, is superior to the single-stomached system of crabeater seals with regard to krill digestion. It is worth noting, however, that the % DE of krill in the crabeater seal is still very high.																	0007-1145	1475-2662				NOV	1994	72	5					713	716		10.1079/BJN19940073							WOS:A1994PW52600006	7826994

Krillase exhibits both endo- and exopeptidase activity but has no microbicidal effect. In model systems with pure cultures of oral microorganisms, Krillase demonstrated inhibition of microbial adhesion to saliva-coated hydroxyapatite. Furthermore, a protocol for the growth of reproducible in vitro plaque films has been developed, and effects of Krillase on the plaque film were investigated by means of scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The results showed that Krillase efficiently released microorganisms from plaque in vitro, the effect being dependent on the enzymatic activity. The surface energy of the substratum had a minor influence on the formation and removal of plaque in vitro. Ellipsometric studies on the formation and enzymatic removal of a salivary pellicle indicated that the enzymatic effect on plaque may partly depend on degradation of the salivary pellicle. Krillase was also able to remove plaque accumulated oil dentures in vivo. Our results demonstrate the potential or Krillase for plaque control, and that these enzymes are worthy of further investigations including clinical studies and work to find a suitable vehicle.																	0909-8836	1600-0722				OCT	2001	109	5					316	324									WOS:000171699000005	11695752

Knowing the selective properties between trawls is crucial information for the management of the krill resources. This study compared the catch patterns between different commercial krill trawls at similar times and overlapping fishing grounds based on scientific data collected by scientific observers onboard commercial trawlers Long Teng (LT) and Fu Rong Hai (FRH). The results showed significant differences in the length-dependent catch densities and cumulative catch densities of krill between the two trawls. The krill length range in catches from LT's trawl was wider than that of FRH's trawl. Furthermore, the catch would consist of a larger proportion of smaller krill in the LT's trawl. The LT's trawl caught significantly higher proportions of krill below 38 mm than FRH's trawl. Even, the LT's trawl caught substantial numbers of krill <30 mm, whereas the FRH's trawl caught very few of them. The main factors causing the difference between trawls in catch pattern were inferred to be related to gear design including differences in mesh sizes used. The results of this study enhance the quality of comparative analysis of scientific data from commercial trawls and the understanding of gear selectivity of different configuration trawls used for harvesting krill.</p>																		2296-7745				SEP 28	2021	8								670663	10.3389/fmars.2021.670663							WOS:000706165500001

This paper examines in situ feeding cycles, ingestion rates and growth of larval krill Euphausia superba. Larval krill were exceptionally numerous, especially over the shelf break and continental slope: mean 8872 larvae m(-2), maximum 30 084 larvae m-2. The developmental stage composition of krill larvae over the shelf was advanced compared to that at continental slope stations, which may have resulted from enhanced food availability over the shelf. Despite the season being late autumn, the feeding activity of larval krill was similar to published summer rates. The intermoult period of larval krill ranged from 6 to 17 days, with daily growth rates reaching 2.2% of body length, 8.7% of body wet mass and 5.7% of body carbon. Daily ingestion rates were 8.5-17.6 mug C ind(-1) d(-1) for calyptopis 3 to furcilia 2 and 35.1-57.4 mug C ind(-1) d(-1) for furcilia 3-5, and were positively correlated with ambient chlorophyll a concentrations. Daily rations showed the same tendency, ranging from 21.5 to 44.5% of body Cd-1 (catyptopis 3 to furcilia 2) and from 17.8 to 29.2% of body Cd-1 (furcilia 3-5). Comparison of daily rations between open water and sea ice stations supports the notion that larval krill at low pelagic food supply under the sea ice have to exploit ice biota to sustain their metabolic demands.

This study aimed to evaluate the thickening function of heat-induced krill protein fluid gels through the investigation of their flow behavior and microstructure. The microstructure of these physical gels was classified as four types, including particulate gels (pH 5.5), transition state from particulate to branched gels (pH 6.0), loose connected networks (pH 6.8, 7.0, 8.0 and 8.6) and fine cross-linked structure (pH 6.4, 7.2 and 7.5). Gels at pH 5.5 and 7.2 showed significantly higher gel strength in comparison with their counterparts at other pHs. Fluid gels showed characteristic non-Newtonian pseudoplastic behavior with low flow behavior indexes in the shear thinning region. Fluid gels at pH 7.2 showed significantly higher viscosity in comparison with other gels, which was related with its viscoelasticity and microstructure. Fluid gels with branched networks exhibited significantly better water binding capacities than particulate gels. Fluid gels became less pseudoplastic as temperature increased, which resulted from the melting of gels. The thixotropy of fluid gels was demonstrated through loop test, stepwise test and start-up flow experiment. Particulate gels at pH 5.5 showed smaller thixotropy in comparison with branched gels at higher pHs. Fine connected fluid gels showed lower structural recovery than loose cross-linked gels under stepwise test. This resulted from the irreversible damage of fine connected structure under high shear rate. Heat-induced fluid gels of krill protein exhibited thickening function and could be applied in food development with desired requirement. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The systematic variations of TS vs. the incident angle of the ensonified wave, henceforth called TS-pattems, were successfully measured for 12 live Antarctic krill. These measurements were compared with the theoretical TS-pattems predicted by the Distorted-Wave Born Approximation-based deformed-cylinder model (DWBA model). While there was good agreement near the main lobe, the measurements were higher than the model predictions in the sidelobe regions; this is consistent with the observations of others. Several possible causes of this discrepancy such as the bending of abdomen and scattering from pleopods were examined, but no single factor was identified as the cause. Rather, it is likely that the discrepancy is a result of a combination of several factors. (c) 2005 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

In the first experiment, after transfer to sea water, salmon smolts were fed diets added 75 or 150gkg(-1) Antarctic krill meal in substitution for fish meal for 13weeks. The apparent digestibility coefficient for crude protein and the majority of the amino acids was significantly lower in the feeds added krill meal (around 83.5%) than in the control diet (84.9%), whereas the digestibility of crude lipids, dry matter and energy was not significantly different among the three diets. Krill meal addition resulted in higher feed intake, which led to higher growth rates and final body weights. In the second experiment, large salmon were fed a diet containing 100gkg(-1) krill meal for 6weeks before slaughter. Their feed intake and growth performance were assessed, and fillet and visceral fat contents were measured. Salmon fed the 100gkg(-1) krill meal diet tended to eat more, resulting in significantly increased growth rates, when compared to control fish.

A fishing vessel during regular operation was used for collection of krill demographic and acoustic data on the shelf northwest of South Orkney Islands. Results show a decrease in the proportion of subadult males, partly reflected in an increase in mature adult males. Concurrently, there was a change in the proportion of males in the sampled population from 0.8 to 0.3, indicating immigration or emigration of krill through the hotspot. A clear trend was observed in the diurnal vertical distribution with deeper and more vertically compact swarms during the day. However, some days displayed very small differences between the day and night distribution and considerable variability in the daytime depth distribution. It was noted that although fishing was carried out during the entire period of the study, there was no obvious trend in the acoustic backscatter, suggesting that the overall krill density was not changing during this period. Using a fishing vessel as a research platform has advantages for understanding the dynamics of the fishery and in quantifying biological and physical processes during actual exploitation of these resources.

J	Kinzey, D; Watters, GM; Reiss, CS				Kinzey, Douglas; Watters, George M.; Reiss, Christian S.			Selectivity and two biomass measures in an age-based assessment of Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba)	FISHERIES RESEARCH												An integrated, age-structured model was fitted to different combinations of survey data using two forms of selectivity (logistic or double-logistic) with time-constant or annually varying selectivity to investigate the population dynamics of Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) near the Antarctic Peninsula. The data were from surveys conducted by the U.S. Antarctic Marine Living Resources Program around the South Shetland Islands from 1992 to 2011. Two indices of krill biomass based on (1) trawl-net samples and (2) hydroacoustic sampling were combined with length-compositions from the nets. Sixteen model configurations using different combinations of the two biomass surveys with the various options for modeling selectivities were examined. Parameters were estimated in phases with the sequential order of the phases randomized until an invertible Hessian matrix was obtained. Model consistency for the estimates of derived quantities was tested using simulated data. Annual trends in the estimates of total biomass, spawning biomass, and recruitment were similar among different configurations assuming time-constant selectivity, but the absolute scaling ranged widely depending on which biomass indices were used. All configurations with time-constant selectivities were able to reproduce the derived quantities of the operating model when fitted to simulated data. Annually varying selectivities produced more variable estimates of the trends in population biomass, but less variable estimates of scale, compared to time-constant configurations fitted to the same data. The models with annually varying selectivities did not produce invertible Hessian matrices, and four of these configurations could not reproduce the derived parameters of their operating model when fitted to simulated data. Using AIC, the model with logistic, time-constant selectivities was selected as the best configuration to fit both sources of biomass data. The two-stage approach of first randomizing the phase order until an invertible Hessian matrix is achieved and then verifying the reproducibility of the estimates of derived quantities using simulated data could be employed in any integrated stock assessment with parameters estimated in phases.

Krill (Euphausia superba) dominated the diet as frequency of occurrence (in 100% of samples), number (> 99%), and percentage contribution in weight (> 94.8%). Other prey items were minor and varied between years. The weight of stomach contents was significantly different. The percentage in weight of whole krill was used to compare the feeding conditions across seasons. It differed significantly at the three sites studied. Distribution of krill size varied among years and localities, showing different krill availability for penguins.																	0722-4060	1432-2056				JUN	2010	33	6					799	806		10.1007/s00300-009-0757-4							WOS:000277556400007

J	Cleary, AC; Durbin, EG; Casas, MC; Zhou, M				Cleary, Alison C.; Durbin, Edward G.; Casas, Maria C.; Zhou, Meng			Winter distribution and size structure of Antarctic krill Euphausia superba populations in-shore along the West Antarctic Peninsula	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												Antarctic krill Euphausia superba are a key component of food webs in the maritime West Antarctic Peninsula, and their life history is tied to the seasonal cycles of sea ice and primary production in the region. Previous work has shown a general in-shore migration of krill in winter in this region; however, the very near-shore has not often been sampled as part of these surveys. We investigated distribution, abundance, and size structure of krill in 3 fjordic bays along the peninsula, and in the adjacent Gerlache Strait area using vertically stratified MOCNESS net tows and ADCP acoustic biomass estimates. Krill abundance was high within bays, with net estimated densities exceeding 60 krill m(-3), while acoustic estimates were an order of magnitude higher. Krill within bays were larger than krill in the Gerlache Strait. Within bays, krill aggregations were observed near the seafloor during the day with aggregations extending to the sediment interface, and exhibited diel vertical migration higher into the water column at night. We suggest these high winter krill abundances within fjords are indicative of an active seasonal migration by krill in the peninsula region. Potential drivers for such a migration include reduced advective losses and costs, and availability of sediment food resources within fjords. Seasonally near-shore krill may also affect stock and recruitment assessments and may have implications for managing the krill fishery in this area.																	0171-8630	1616-1599				JUN 23	2016	552						115	129		10.3354/meps11772							WOS:000379812200009						
J	Bustos, RO; Romo, CR; Healy, MG				Bustos, RO; Romo, CR; Healy, MG			Purification of trypsin-like enzymes from Antarctic krill processing wastewater	PROCESS BIOCHEMISTRY												The presence of trypsin-like enzymes was evaluated in different waste fractions produced during mechanical peeling of Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) using N-alpha-benzoylarginine p-nitroanilide as substrate. The enzymes were highly concentrated in the exudate (drip) obtained after thawing 25 kg of frozen krill blocks. They presented an unusually high stability in this material, retaining over 40% of the initial activity after 60 days of storage at 45 degrees C. From this wastewater, trypsin-like enzymes were purified 140-fold in one step by affinity chromatography on p-aminobenzamidine Sepharose 4B. The purified enzymes migrated as a broad band in polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and presented a molecular weight between 32 000 and 33 000. The use of krill processing wastewater as a source for commercial production of trypsin-like enzymes is discussed. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

Inhibition of DPP-IV may improve glycemic control in diabetics by preventing the rapid breakdown of incretin hormones and prolonging their physiological action. In this study, Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) protein was hydrolyzed using animal proteolytic enzymes. The hydrolysate was purified sequentially by ultrafiltration, gel filtration chromatography and reversed phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC). DPP-IV inhibitory activity of the fractions achieved. from Antarctic krill protein was determined by DPP-IV screening reagent kit. Two purified peptides were identified by Xevo G2-XS QTof mass spectrometer (QTOF-MS). One peptide purified was Ala-Pro (AP) with IC50 values of 0.0530 mg/mL, the other Ile-Pro-Ala (IPA) with IC50 values of 0.0370 mg/mL. They both exhibited strong DPP-IV inhibitory activity. The molecular docking analysis revealed that DPP-IV inhibition by AP and IPA was mainly due to formation of a strong interaction surface force with the 91-96 and 101-105 amino acids of the DPP-IV. Our results suggested that the protein hydrolysate from Antarctic krill can be considered as a promising natural source of DPP-IV inhibitory peptides in the management of diabetes.																	1570-0232	1873-376X				OCT 1	2017	1064						56	61		10.1016/j.jchromb.2017.09.001							WOS:000412958100009	28915418

J	Tarling, GA				Tarling, Geraint A.			Routine metabolism of Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) in South Georgia waters: absence of metabolic compensation at its range edge	MARINE BIOLOGY												Routine respiration rates in the South Georgia stock of Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) were measured to compare with previously published measurements on stocks from colder locations further south. Within the natural temperature range of this species (-1.8 degrees to 5.5 degrees C), respiration rate data from both the present and previous studies were adequately fitted by a single Arrhenius regression (Q(10) of 2.8), although South Georgia krill showed an upward deviation from this regression between 0 degrees and 2 degrees C (the lower temperature range at South Georgia). Metabolic compensation (i.e. the comparative lowering of respiration rate) at the high temperatures experienced at South Georgia was not apparent, although the higher than predicted metabolic rates at low temperatures suggests acclimation of South Georgia krill to a warm water lifestyle. Weight-specific respiration rate was significantly higher in sub-adults and adults compared to juveniles, highlighting the metabolic burden of reproduction. South Georgia krill showed no further increase in respiration rate when exposed to acute temperatures (5.5-12.2 degrees C), indicating that they were already at the limit of aerobic capacity by 5.5 degrees C. Overall, this study shows that even small degrees of additional warming to South Georgia waters are likely to make conditions there metabolically unsustainable for Antarctic krill.

J	Wang, F; Sheng, J; Chen, YX; Xu, JK				Wang, Fang; Sheng, Jun; Chen, Yixuan; Xu, Jiakun			Microbial diversity and dominant bacteria causing spoilage during storage and processing of the Antarctic krill, Euphausia superba	POLAR BIOLOGY												The Antarctic region is known for its ecological conditions and the presence of some of the rarest microorganisms on earth. Antarctic krill rapidly degrades while at rest or during transport due to high-activity enzymes in its flesh or from microbes. In this study, we analyzed the microbial diversity of the Antarctic krill, Euphausia superba, and identified the dominant bacteria that cause spoilage during storage and transport using culture-independent high-throughput sequencing and microbial pure culture methods. Antarctic krill samples were incubated at temperatures of 0 degrees C, 4 degrees C, 16 degrees C, and 25 degrees C to determine the microbial diversity and abundance in decaying marine krill samples. Metagenome high-throughput sequencing indicated that, under incubation at 4 degrees C and 0 degrees C for 24 h, the microbial diversity of the Antarctic krill samples was high, with high species richness of microbes adapted to the low-temperature environment, as indicated by the overwhelming dominance of Enterococcus and Bacillus. On the other hand, Psychrobacter became the dominant bacteria at storage temperatures of 16 degrees C and 25 degrees C. Quantitative PCR results demonstrated that the microbial copy number increased as the temperature increased from 0 to 25 degrees C, and the quantity of bacteria was much greater than that of fungi under the same storage conditions. Microbial pure culture methods demonstrated that Psychrobacter was the dominant genus at each incubation temperature after 24 h of storage. Psychrobacter sp. and Psychrobacter-like strains isolated from the Antarctic krill samples exhibited protease activity. Our laboratory results indicated that Psychrobacter was the primary cause of spoilage of the Antarctic krill, E. superba. The results from ITS rDNA fungal sequencing showed that unclassified Saccharomycetes were the predominant microbes in all the Antarctic krill samples.																	0722-4060	1432-2056				JAN	2021	44	1					163	171		10.1007/s00300-020-02789-x		JAN 2021					WOS:000607021300001

Circumpolar connections between Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba Dana) populations: Investigating the roles of ocean and sea ice transport	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART I-OCEANOGRAPHIC RESEARCH PAPERS												Antarctic krill, Euphausia superba Dana, has a heterogeneous circumpolar distribution in the Southern Ocean. Krill have a close association with sea ice which provides access to a critical food source and shelter, particularly in the early life stages. Advective modelling of transport pathways of krill have until now been on regional scales and have not taken explicit account of sea ice. Here we present Lagrangian modelling studies at the circumpolar scale that include interaction with sea ice. The advection scheme uses ocean velocity output from the Ocean Circulation and Climate Advanced Modelling (OCCAM) project model together with satellite-derived sea ice motion vectors to examine the potential roles of the ocean and sea ice in maintaining the observed circumpolar krill distribution. We show that the Antarctic Coastal Current is likely to be important in generating the large-scale distribution and that sea ice motion can substantially modify the ocean transport pathways, enhancing retention or dispersal depending upon location. Within the major krill region of the Scotia Sea, the effect of temporal variability in both the ocean and sea ice velocity fields is examined. Variability in sea ice motion increases variability of influx to South Georgia, at times concentrating the influx into pulses of arrival. This variability has implications for the ecosystem around the island. The inclusion of sea ice motion leads to the identification of source regions for the South Georgia krill populations additional to those identified when only ocean motion is considered. This study indicates that the circumpolar oceanic circulation and interaction with sea ice is important in determining the large-scale distribution of krill and its associated variability.

J	Fach, BA; Klinck, JM				Fach, Bettina A.; Klinck, John M.			Transport of Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) across the Scotia Sea. Part I: Circulation and particle tracking simulations	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART I-OCEANOGRAPHIC RESEARCH PAPERS												The Harvard Ocean Prediction System (HOPS) is configured to simulate the circulation of the Scotia Sea and environs. This is part of a study designed to test the hypothesis that Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) populations at South Georgia in the eastern Scotia Sea are sustained by import of individuals from upstream regions, such as the western Antarctic Peninsula. Comparison of the simulated circulation fields obtained from HOPS with observations showed good agreement. The surface circulation, particularly through the Drake Passage and across the Scotia Sea, matches observations, with its northeastward flow characterized by three high-speed fronts. Also, the Weddell Sea and the Brazil Current, and their associated transports match observations. In addition, mesoscale variability, an important component of the flow in this region, is found in the simulated circulation and the model is overall well suited to model krill transport. Drifter simulations conducted with HOPS showed that krill spawned in areas coinciding with known krill spawning sites along the west Antarctic Peninsula continental shelf can be entrained into the Southern Antarctic Circumpolar Current Front (SACCF). They are transported across the Scotia Sea to South Georgia in 10 months or less. Drifters originating on the continental shelf of the Weddell Sea can reach South Georgia as well; however, transport from this region averages about 20 months. Additional simulations show that such transport is sensitive to changes in wind stress and the location of the SACCF. The results of this study show that krill populations along the Antarctic Peninsula and the Weddell Sea are possible source populations that can provide krill to the South Georgia population. However, successful transport of krill to South Georgia is shown to depend on a multitude of factors, such as the location of the spawning area and timing of spawning, and variations in the location of the SACCF. Therefore, this study provides insight into which environmental factors control the successful transport of krill across the Scotia Sea and with it a better understanding of krill distribution in the region.

Defatted krill powder by-product generates from the process of krill oil, which is rich in various types of amino acids. This study aimed at recovering tyrosine from defatted krill by-product through enzymatic hydrolysis. Defatted krill by-product was hydrolyzed with three types of protease under optimum conditions with different incubation time. Free tyrosine dissociated from protein through hydrolysis by trypsin and was detected in the protein hydrolysates. Content of tyrosine increased with the increasing of incubation time till 5 h. Tyrosine extract contained 6.43 mg/kg fluorine and over 95 % of tyrosine, which demonstrated its high purity and safety. Tyrosine extract showed rod-shaped microstructure through scanning electron microscope analysis. Crystalline structure and thermal properties of tyrosine extract agreed well with those of l-tyrosine standard. During this process, both tyrosine of high purity and bioactive peptide products were obtained.																	1935-5130	1935-5149				APR	2016	9	4					621	627		10.1007/s11947-015-1658-x							WOS:000371614300007

Three principal biogeographic zones were identified: northern Gerlache Strait, Bransfield Strait and Drake Passage; these were recognizable by consistent patterns of physical circulation. Two cohorts of E. superba larvae were produced. The first cohort appeared as C1 larvae in mid-January, and the second appeared in mid-February; the second cohort did not occur in Gerlache Strait waters. Larvae in Gerlache Strait were more abundant, larger in size and weight, better fed, and developed and grew more rapidly than larvae of the same stages in both Bransfield Strait and Drake Passage. In Gerlache Strait abundance reached 12,000 individuals m-2, intermolt periods were < 8 days for early calyptopis stages, and growth rates were higher than any previously reported. Growth of early stages was exponential during late January, but slowed markedly by late March as the population entered late furcilia stages. Calptopis stages were estimated to ingest up to 19.7% of their body carbon per day, and 14.5% of body nitrogen per day. The daily ration of late furcilia stages was reduced to 4.4% body carbon per day, and 1.9% body nitrogen per day. Gross growth efficiencies ranged, in terms of carbon, from 13.2% for furcilia to 52.5% for calyptopis stages; in terms of nitrogen they ranged from 29.9 to 65.5%. It is proposed that the northern Gerlache Strait is a primary nursery area for E. superba, and that local circulation promotes high primary productivity and prolongs the residence time of larvae in a nearshore environment which is favorable to development and growth. Coastal environments such as Gerlache Strait may make a disproportionately large contribution to annual krill recruitment.																	0198-0149					AUG-SEP	1991	38	8-9					1213	1240		10.1016/0198-0149(91)90103-M							WOS:A1991GH34600015

Combined effects of ocean acidification and elevated temperature on feeding, growth, and physiological processes of Antarctic krill Euphausia superba	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												Antarctic krill Euphausia superba is a key species in the Southern Ocean, where its habitat is projected to undergo continued warming and increases in pCO(2). Experiments during 2 summer field seasons at Palmer Station, Antarctica, investigated the independent and interactive effects of elevated temperature and pCO(2) (decreased pH) on feeding, growth, acid-base physiology, metabolic rate, and survival of adult Antarctic krill. Ingestion and clearance rates of chlorophyll were depressed under low pH (7.7) compared to ambient pH (8.1) after a 48 h acclimation period, but this difference disappeared after a 21 d acclimation. Growth rates were negligible and frequently negative, but were significantly more negative at high (3 degrees C, -0.03 mm d(-1)) compared to ambient temperature (0 degrees C, -0.01 mm d(-1)) with no effect of pH. Modest elevations in tissue total CO2 and tissue pH were apparent at low pH but were short-lived. Metabolic rate increased with temperature but was suppressed at low pH in smaller but not larger krill. Although effects of elevated temperature and/or decreased pH were mostly sublethal, mortality was higher at high temperature/low pH (58%) compared to ambient temperature/pH or ambient temperature/low pH (> 90%). This study identified 3 dominant patterns: (1) shorter-term effects were primarily pH-dependent; (2) krill compensated for lower pH relatively quickly; and (3) longer-term effects on krill growth and survival were strongly driven by temperature with little to no pH effect.																	0171-8630	1616-1599				APR 29	2021	665						1	18		10.3354/meps13715							WOS:000649299900001

PP-AKP was supplemented to ovariectomized Sprague Dawley rats for 90 days. The results showed that PP-AKP treatment remarkably prevented the reduction of bone mass and improved cancellous bone structure and biochemical properties. PP-AKP also significantly decreased serum contents of tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRACP), cathepsin K (Cath-k), matrix metalloproteinases-9 (MMP-9), deoxypyridinoline (DPD), C-terminal telopeptide of collagen I (CTX-1), Ca, and P. Mechanism investigation revealed that PP-AKP significantly increased the osteoprotegerin (OPG)/receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa B ligand (RANKL) ratio in mRNA expression, protein expression, and serum content. Further research suggested that NF-kappa B signaling pathways were inhibited by suppressing the mRNA and protein expressions of nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NFATc1) and tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6), diminishing the mRNA expression and phosphorylation of nuclear factor kappa B p65 (NF-kappa B p65), three key transcription factors in NF-kappa B pathways. These results suggest that PP-AKP can improve osteoporosis by inhibiting bone resorption via suppressing the activation of osteodastogenesis related NF-kappa B pathways.				yuming, wang/K-8179-2012; Xia, Guanghua/AAN-1812-2021	Xia, Guanghua/0000-0001-7269-5751												0021-8561	1520-5118				NOV 4	2015	63	43					9550	9557		10.1021/acs.jafc.5b04263							WOS:000364355700022	26456758

Bengtson			Altered developmental timing in early life stages of Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) exposed to p,p '-DDE	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Persistent organic pollutants (POPS) are persistent, toxic and bioaccumulative anthropogenic organic chemicals, capable of undergoing long range environmental transport to remote areas including the Antarctic. p,p'-dichlorodiphenyl dichloroethylene (pp'-DDE) has been identified as a dominant POP accumulating in Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba), which is a key Southern Ocean species. This study examined the developmental toxicity of pp'-DDE via aqueous exposure to Antarctic krill larvae. p,p'-DDE exposure was found to stimulate developmental timing in the first three larval stages of Antarctic krill, while extended monitoring of larvae after a five day exposure period had ended, revealed delayed inhibitory responses during development to the fourth larval stage. Stimulatory responses were observed from the lowest p,p'-DDE body residue tested of 10.1 +/- 3.0 mu mol/kg (3.2 +/- 0.95 mg/kg) preserved wet weight, which is comparable to findings for temperate species and an order of magnitude lower than the exposure level found to cause sublethal behavioural effects in Antarctic krill. The delayed responses included increased mortality, which had doubled in the highest p,p'-DDE treatment (95 +/- 8.9% mortality at 20 mu g/L p,p'-DDE) compared to the solvent control (44 +/- 11% mortality) 2 weeks after end of exposure. Development of surviving metanauplius larvae to calyptopis 1 larvae was delayed by 2 days in p,p'-DDE exposed larvae compared with untreated larvae. Finally, the developmental success of surviving pp'-DDE exposed larvae was reduced by 50 to 75% compared to the solvent control (100% developmental success). The lowest observed effect concentration for all delayed effects was 1 mu g/L, the lowest exposure concentration tested. These findings demonstrate the importance of delayed and indirect effects of toxicant exposure.

We collected acoustic data and key environmental data continuously across extensive gradients in the little-studied Southeast Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean. A total of 4791 krill swarms with swarm descriptors including swarm height and length, packing density, swimming depth and inter-swarm distance were extracted. Through multivariate statistics, swarms were categorized into 4 groups. Group 2 swarms were largest (median length 108 m and thickness 18 m), whereas swarms in both Groups 1 and 4 were on average small, but differed markedly in depth distribution (median: 52 m for Group 1 vs. 133 m for Group 4). There was a strong spatial autocorrelation in the occurrence of swarms, and an autologistic regression model found no prediction of swarm occurrence from environmental variables for any of the Groups 1, 2 or 4. Probability of occurrence of Group 3 swarms, however, increased with increasing depth and temperature. Group 3 was the most distinctive swarm group with an order of magnitude higher packing density (median: 226 ind. m(-3)) than swarms from any of the other groups and about twice the distance to nearest neighbor swarm (median: 493 m). The majority of the krill were present in Group 3 swarms, and the absence of association with hydrographic or topographic concentrating mechanisms strongly suggests that these swarms aggregate through their own locomotion, possibly associated with migration.

The replacement of fish meal with Antarctic krill, Euphausia superba in diets for Atlantic salmon, Salmo salar	AQUACULTURE NUTRITION												A total of six isoprotein and isolipid diets for Atlantic salmon, Salmo salar L., were prepared substituting from 0 to 100% of fish meal protein (0-68% of diet by dry weight) with meal from Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba). The feed produced from high inclusion levels of krill meal had lower ability to absorb lipid during vacuum coating than fish meal. Both amino acid and fatty acid compositions of the diets were fairly similar. The experiment commenced using salmon averaging 500 g and ended at a mean weight of 1500-1800 g (140 days of feeding). Moderate amounts of krill meal (20-60% of krill protein) in the diets increased growth during the first 71 days of feeding compared with the fish meal control, while no growth difference was observed during the last 69 days of feeding. This may, at least in parts, be explained by a feed-attractant function of the krill meal. Muscle dry weight and lipid concentrations were unaffected by the diet. Feed conversion rate increased with high levels of krill meal in the diets (e. g. for the last period from 0.94 in the 0% diet to 1.26 in the 100% diet). This indicates that the fish were able to compensate by eating more to maintain growth. The apparent digestibility coefficients of dry matter and protein were not influenced by diet, but both faecal moisture and lipid had a tendency to increase at the highest inclusion level (all protein from krill meal). This may be related to chitin in the krill diet that is known to decrease lipid absorption and induce diarrhoea (increased water content in faeces). Chitin was not utilized to any major extent. Welfare parameters such as blood haemoglobin, red blood cell counts, plasma protein, cholesterol, triacylglycerols and glucose levels were unaffected by diets. Clinical indicators of cellular damage (alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase) were similar indicating no diet-induced tissue damage during the trial.

The contribution of ice algae to the winter energy budget of juvenile Antarctic krill in years with contrasting sea ice conditions	ICES JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE												Krill overwintering strategies vary with ontogeny and year; understanding this variability is essential to predicting how the species will respond to climate change in the future. Overwintering studies have focused on larval and adult krill, but we know little about how juvenile krill overwinter. The late winter diet of juvenile krill is important because it will determine their growth and development rates and consequently their reproductive potential the following spring. A diet rich in ice algae would promote growth and reproductive development. The Bransfield Strait (northern Antarctic Peninsula, AP) is an important overwintering ground for krill; it has been proposed this region offers a food-rich winter environment. We examined the contribution of ice algae to the energy budget of overwintering juvenile krill during 2 years with contrasting sea ice conditions. Grazing on ice algae contributed approximate to 146% to their winter energy budget in 2015, even though ice concentrations were 50% and consisted of newly formed pancake ice. However, when sea ice advanced late in the Bransfield Strait (2016), ice algae contributed significantly less (approximate to 16%) to the winter energy budget of juvenile krill. Delayed sea ice advance may negatively affect growth and reproductive development of overwintering juvenile krill.

Average trawling depth usually showed a marked diurnal change during summer and winter in SS and SO. Daily average trawling depth tended to be shallower during austral summer and early autumn, deepened gradually from autumn and reached maximum depth in winter in the Scotia Sea, shifting to shallower depths again in early spring. The average catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) was highest during the day and lowest at night in autumn and winter in each area, but lower during the day in summer in SS and SO. It is suggested that the seasonal and diurnal changes in vertical migration and aggregation of krill are closely related to its feeding and spawning ecology and avoidance of visual predators.																	1023-4063						2005	12						163	172									WOS:000233386600010

Variations in proteins and nutritional properties of the FKPC were analyzed. Gel electrophoresis analysis indicated that some variations in protein composition were introduced by autolysis and pH shift during the process of isoelectric precipitation and fluoride removal. The FKPC was composed of 81.01% +/- 0.45% crude protein (dry basis) and 16.78% +/- 0.26% total lipid (dry basis), exhibited excellent amino-acid composition in all the essential amino acids, exceeding the requirements of the FAO/WHO/UNU for food protein, and was rich in omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, especially eicosapentaenoic (EPA) and docosahexaenoic (DHA) acids present in phospholipids. The fluoride level of FKPC was 79.79 +/- 2.10 g/g (dry basis), which met the USFDA requirements. The surimi yield reached 43.74%, and the mean recovery rate of protein and fat was 52.68% and 41.44%, respectively. The nutritional value, safe level of fluoride, and high yield rate provide evidence that FKPC has a promising future in the food industry as a new aquatic protein and lipid resource.																	1049-8850	1547-0636					2017	26	8					958	968		10.1080/10498850.2017.1364315							WOS:000414077600008

Metabolic data, elemental and biochemical composition as well as morphological parameters revealed that, at the beginning of the experiment, krill was in transition from winter to summer physiology, with some features typical for late winter/spring (low lipid reserves, low C:N ratio, elevated ON ratio) and others for summer (high respiration rates, high MDH activity, large green digestive gland, short intermoult period (IMP) and fast growth). Starvation reduced body reserves drastically by more than 1% C per day. In relative terms, lipids (40%) and glycogen (30%) were reduced most and proteins by 10% of the initial value. Absolute consumption, however, was approximately 4% DM for lipids and proteins each, whereas contribution of glycogen was negligible. Within lipids, triacylglycerols (TAG) and phospholipids (PL) fell most dramatically from already low levels by 84% and 39%, respectively. Phosphatylcholine (PC) constituted 57% of PL and declined by 46%. As a result, proportions of the lipid classes changed with sterols increasing relatively. Metabolite changes were similar in cephalothorax and abdomen, although TAG in the cephalothorax fell more drastically. High metabolic activity at the beginning of starvation was quickly reduced to reach 53% after 18 days, accompanied by a reduction in the abdominal activity of malate dehydrogenase (MDH) by 25%. Our results may provide some explanation why recruitment of some year-classes of krill fails. Despite execution of the experiment in spring (i.e. transitional physiology state) and its short duration, some changes in the activity of metabolic enzymes in the abdomen, representing lipolytic, glycolytic and proteolytic pathways, respectively, were measured. Rising activities of 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase (HOAD) and glyceralaldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) indicated increased lipolytic and glycolytic fluxes, respectively, whereas declining glutamate dehydrogenase (GluDH) activity suggests reduced proteolytic flux. Activities of other enzymes from protein catabolism, alanine aminotransferase (AlaAT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AspAT), however, remained unchanged. Ratios calculated from these trends indicated a declining importance of protein use during the course of starvation compared with consumption of lipids and glycogen. These results suggest that constant-proportion enzymes from different catabolic pathways, and calculated ratios thereof, may be useful in detecting shifts between the consumption of different body reserves.

J	Fach, BA; Hofmann, EE; Murphy, EJ				Fach, Bettina A.; Hofmann, Eileen E.; Murphy, Eugene J.			Transport of Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) across the Scotia Sea. Part II. Krill growth and survival	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART I-OCEANOGRAPHIC RESEARCH PAPERS												A time-dependent, size-structured, physiologically based krill growth model was used in conjunction with a circulation model to test the hypothesis that Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) populations at South Georgia are sustained by import of individuals from upstream regions. Surface phytoplankton concentrations along the simulated drifter trajectories were extracted from historical Coastal Zone Color Scanner (CZCS) measurements and sea ice biota concentrations were calculated from sea ice concentration and extent extracted along drifter trajectories from Special Sensor Microwave/Imager measurements. As additional food sources, a time series of heterotrophic food was constructed from historical data, and time series of detritus concentrations were calculated using phytoplankton concentrations extracied from CZCS measurements together with measured particulate organic carbon to chlorophyll a ratios. These food resources along specified drifter trajectories were then input to the krill growth model to determine the size and viability of krill during transport from the source region to South Georgia. The krill growth model simulations showed that no single food source can support continuous growth of krill during the 58-306 days needed for transport to South Georgia. However, under the current assumptions results indicate that combinations of food sources during the transport time enhanced krill survival, with heterotrophic food and detritus being particularly important during periods of low phytoplankton concentrations. The growth model simulations also showed that larval and juvenile krill originating along the western Antarctic Peninsula can grow to 1+ (14-36mm) and 2+ (26-45 mm) age and size classes observed at South Georgia during the time needed for transport to this region. Krill originating in the Weddell Sea need 20 months for transport, which allows retention in a potentially high food environment, provided by sea ice, for almost 1 year. Krill then complete transport to South Georgia in the following year and larval and juvenile krill grow to 2+ (26-45 mm) and 3+ (35-60 mm) age and size classes during transport. The results of this study show that the successful transport of krill to South Georgia depends on a multitude of factors, such as the location of the spawning area and timing of spawning, food concentrations during transport, predation, and variations in the location of the Southern Antarctic Circumpolar Current Front (SACCF) and in sea ice extent.

J	Arnold, KH; Shreeve, RS; Atkinson, A; Clarke, A				Arnold, KH; Shreeve, RS; Atkinson, A; Clarke, A			Growth rates of Antarctic krill, Euphausia superba: Comparison of the instantaneous growth rate method with nitrogen and phosphorus stoichiometry	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Zooplankton growth rates are hard to measure directly, and proxy measurements are desirable to encompass the variety of species and scales of interest. The growth rate hypothesis of stoichiometric theory states that a negative relationship exists between nitrogen: phosphorus (N: P) stoichiometry and growth rate, driven by cellular ribosomal ribonucleic acid (rRNA) content. Despite the wealth of literature on the growth rate hypothesis, there exist no practical demonstrations of its use in the marine literature. We thus investigated whether this hypothesis could be the basis of a technique to estimate growth rates of Euphausia superba by comparing, for the same individual krill, elemental stoichiometry and growth rates derived from the instantaneous growth rate (IGR) method. These growth rates were the first IGR measurements from South Georgia; from within a restricted area over the course of just 1 month, these rates were highly variable, from negative to near maximum rates recorded for the species. Although there were significant differences in N: P ratio and phosphorus content between individuals and schools, there was no relationship between N: P ratio and growth rate when data were grouped by school. Thus, our data do not support the predictions of the growth rate hypothesis at an intraspecific scale. However, when all data were pooled, the mean values of growth rate and N: P ratio did fit the interspecific relationship established previously for freshwater zooplankton. We suggest that krill maintain the biochemical machinery for high growth potential and maintain high growth in summer to take advantage of short-term fluctuations in food.																	0024-3590	1939-5590				NOV	2004	49	6					2152	2161		10.4319/lo.2004.49.6.2152							WOS:000225137100023

Juveniles and adults	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												The overwintering success of Euphausia superba is a key factor that dictates population size, but there is uncertainty over how they cope with the scarcity of pelagic food. Both nonfeeding strategies (reduced metabolism, lipid use, or shrinkage in size) and switching to other foods (carnivory, ice algae, or detritus) have been suggested. We examined these alternatives in the southwest Lazarev Sea in autumn (April 1999), when sea ice was forming and phytoplankton was at winter concentrations. Both juveniles and adults had a very high lipid content (36% and 44% of dry mass, respectively) of which >40% was phospholipid. However, their low O:N ratios suggested that these reserves were not being used. Results from gut contents analysis and large volume incubations agreed that juveniles fed mainly on phytoplankton and adults fed on small (<3 mm) copepods. This dietary difference was supported possibly by elevated concentrations of 20:1 and 22:1 fatty acids in the adults. The feeding methods also confirmed that feeding rates were low compared with those in summer. Even when acclimated to high food concentrations, clearance and ingestion rates were <30% of summer rates. Respiration and ammonium excretion rates of freshly caught krill were 60%-80% of those in summer and declined significantly during 18 d of starvation. These findings suggest both switch feeding and energy conservation strategies, with a trend of reduced and more carnivorous feeding with ontogeny. This points to a "compromise" strategy for postlarvae, but there are alternative explanations. First, the krill may have reduced their feeding in an autumn transition to a nonfeeding mode, and, second, some of the population may have maintained a high feeding effort whereas the remainder was not feeding.

In order to investigate this, we analysed data on krill-eating predators at South Georgia from 1980 to 2000. Indices of population size and reproductive performance showed declines in all species and an increase in the frequency of years of low reproductive output. Changes in the population structure of krill and its relationship with reproductive performance suggested that the biomass of krill within the largest size class was sufficient to support predator demand in the 1980s but not in the 1990s. We suggest that the effects of underlying changes in the system on the krill population structure have been amplified by predator-induced mortality, resulting in breeding predators now regularly operating close to the limit of krill availability. Understanding how krill demography is affected by changes in physical environmental factors and by predator consumption and how, in turn, this influences predator performance and survival, is one of the keys to predicting future change in Antarctic marine ecosystems.																	0962-8452					FEB 22	2001	268	1465					377	384		10.1098/rspb.2000.1371							WOS:000167214000007	11270434

In this paper, we described the gene organization, gene rearrangement and codon usage in the mitochondrial genome of Euphausia superba Dana 1852 (sampling from Prydz Bay, PB). The mitochondrial genome of E. superba is more than 15,498 bp in length (partial non-coding region was not determined). Translocation of four tRNAs (trnL (1) , trnL (2) , trnW and trnI) and duplication of one tRNA (trnN) were founded in the mitochondrial genome of E. superba when comparing its genome with the pancrustacean ground pattern. To investigate the phylogenetic relationship within Malacostraca, phylogenetic trees based on currently available malacostracan mitochondrial genomes were built with the maximum likelihood and the Bayesian models. All analyses based on nucleotide and amino acid data strongly support the monophyly of Stomatopoda, Penaeidae, Caridea, and Brachyura, which is consistent with previous research. However, the taxonomic position of Euphausiacea within Malacostraca is unstable. From comparing the mitochondrial genome between E. superba (PB) and E. superba (sampling from Weddell Sea, WS), we found that nad2 gene contains maximal variation with 61 segregating sites, following by nad5 gene which has 12 segregating sites. Thus, nad2 and nad5 genes may be used as potential molecular markers to study the inherit diversity among different E. superba groups, which would be helpful to the exploitation and management of E. superba resources.

From early to mid-summer krill density increased and showed distinct offshore-inshore differences in abundance and maturity stages. In mid-summer, krill density was low in the oceanic zone (8 gm(-2)) and higher in the slope frontal zone (36 gm(-2)), being highest along the shelf break (131 gm(-2)) in the inshore zone. Krill were in the reproductive stage in the oceanic and frontal zones, but non-reproductive in the inshore zone. Water circulation, food and frontal features were considered important environmental factors determining the occurrence of high krill concentrations in these waters. Drifting buoys indicated that the surface water circulation in areas of krill concentrations was characterized by a sluggish current with eddies along the shelf break in the inshore zone and a shear current in the frontal zone, thus enhancing the residence time for krill. Diatom abundance in both the frontal and inshore zones increased from early to mid-summer, improving krill feeding conditions. Gravid females were closely associated with the frontal zone, showing that the latter may also be a favored spawning area because of the higher probability of survival for embryos and larvae, in addition to enhanced opportunities for their transport to nursery grounds by prevailing currents. In the waters north of the South Shetland Islands, krill appeared to be highly adapted for exploitation of the rich food resources of the frontal/inshore zone, taking advantage of oceanographic features that led to their retention in these zones.

Inclusion levels were 0.000, 4.125, 8.250, and 12.375% (control, KM4.125, KM8.250, and KM12.375, respectively), and groups of large-sized fish (average body weight = 190.6 g) received these diets for 99 d. No significant differences were found in body length, body weight, and specific growth rate compared with the control group, but the KM4.125 and KM8.250 groups had significantly increased condition factors and hepatosomatic indices. The KM8.250 fish showed a significant increase in redness values in the dorsal skin, while the KM12.375 fish presented significantly higher yellowness in the ventral skin and tail fin. Addition of krill meal exerted no significant effect on whole-body proximate composition. The KM8.250 group showed significantly higher lipid content and lower ash content, which differed from those of the KM12.375 group. Most of the amino acids in muscle and liver tissues remained unchanged compared to those in the control. The KM4.125 group showed significantly higher muscle proline, serine, and total functional amino acids, while the total amino acid content in KM12.375 fish significantly decreased. The results indicated that dietary inclusion of fish meal with up to 8.25% krill meal does not result in adverse effects on growth and body composition of large-sized Large Yellow Croaker; however, addition of krill meal could improve skin coloration in these fish.																	1522-2055	1548-8454				OCT	2021	83	4					255	266		10.1002/naaq.10185		AUG 2021					WOS:000689684400001

Fractions with astaxanthin monoesters and diesters of Antarctic krill Euphausia superba were isolated. Astaxanthin esters were separated by C18-HPLC depending on the number of carbons and double bonds of esterified fatty acid(s). Small amounts of other lipids remained in the samples, but relative molecular masses of carotenoid esters could be measured by field desorption mass spectrometry without fragmentation and interference from contaminant lipids. The fatty acids were determined by calculation of difference between astaxanthin and astaxanthin esters. Only five kinds of fatty acids, dodecarroate, tetradecanoate, hexadecanoate, hexadecenoate and octadecenoate, were detected. Fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry and secondary ion mass spectrometry showed similar spectra. The fatty acid composition in astaxanthin esters was different from those in krill lipids. Therefore, determination of fatty acids in carotenoid esters by a combination of HPLC elution profile and mild mass spectrometry is found to be a useful tool. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc.

The AUV was equipped with the same type of scientific echosounder as the research vessel (Simrad EK500 operating at 38 and 120 kHz) and measured the density of krill along transect acoustically (g m(-2) wet mass) prior to the ship's arrival. We hypothesised that if krill avoided the ship, perhaps in response to radiated noise, then the ship should detect less krill than the AUV which is known to have much lower noise levels than the ship. We were unable to detect any significant difference between the density of krill detected by the ship or the AUV, either at the transect level or at finer scales within transects. We conclude, therefore, that avoidance by krill of RRS James Clark Ross will not significantly bias acoustic estimates of krill abundance by this vessel. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Direct measurements of the refractive indices require sections of fresh, unfixed tissue and the use of an interference microscope, but frequently neither is available. Using the eye of the Antarctic krill Euphausia superba (the main food of baleen whales) we developed a computational method to predict a likely refractive index distribution non-invasively from sections of fixed material without the need of an interference microscope. We used a computer model of the eye and calculated the most realistic spatial distribution of the refractive index gradient in the crystalline cone that would enable the eye to produce a sharp image on the retina. The animals are known to see well and on the basis of our computations we predict that for the eyes of the adult a maximum refractive index of 1.45-1.50 in the centre of the cone yields a better angular sensitivity and light absorption in a target receptor of the retina than if N-max were 1.55. In juveniles with a narrower spatial separation between dioptric structures and retina, however, an N-max of 1.50-1.55 gives a superior result. Our method to determine the most likely refractive index distribution in the cone without the need of fresh material and an interference microscope could be useful in the study of other invertebrate eyes that are known to possess good resolving power, but for a variety of reasons are not suitable for or will not permit direct refractive index measurements of their dioptric tissues to be taken.

To gain insight into the structural and folding mechanisms of AK from Euphausia superba (ESAK), we purified ESAK from muscle properly. The enzyme behaved as a monomeric protein with a molecular mass of about 40 kDa and had pH and temperature optima of 8.0 and 30 degrees C, respectively. The K-m(Arg) and K-m(ATP) for the synthesis of phosphoarginine were 0.30 and 0.47 mM, respectively, and k(cat)/K-m(Arg) was 282.7 s(-1)/mM. A study of the inhibition kinetics of structural unfolding in the denaturant sodium dodecyl sulfate (SOS) was conducted. The results showed that ESAK was almost completely inactivated by 1.0 mM SDS. The kinetics analyzed via time-interval measurements revealed that the inactivation was a first-order reaction, with the kinetic processes shifting from a monophase to biphase as SDS concentrations increased. Measurements of intrinsic and 1-anilinonaphthalene-8-sulfonate-binding fluorescence showed that SDS concentrations lower than 5 mM did not induce conspicuous changes in tertiary structures, while higher concentrations of SDS exposed hydrophobic surfaces and induced conformational changes. These results confirmed that the active region of AK is more flexible than the overall enzyme molecule.(C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Summer distribution and demography of Antarctic krill Euphausia superba Dana, 1852 (Euphausiacea) at the South Orkney Islands, 2011-2015	JOURNAL OF CRUSTACEAN BIOLOGY												We carried out a survey of Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba Dana, 1850) from 2011 to 2015 to establish a long-term, time-series dataset of distribution, abundance, and demography for this species in the South Orkney Islands sector of the Southern Ocean. This species is abundant in this region and is subjected to high-intensity fishing, but previous assessments of density and population dynamics are few and outdated. Our data for Antarctic krill was collected from trawl stations along survey line transects covering the South Orkney plateau and shelf region during the summers of five consecutive years. We used concurrent data on hydrography, bathymetry, and proxies for algal biomass to describe potential spatial patterns of demography and abundance of E. superba. Comparative analysis of the demographic composition showed that 2012 differed from the other years by having a higher proportion of juveniles; otherwise a consistent pattern was found among years and within the study area. The highest biomass during the study period occurred along the northern shelf edge of the South Orkney Islands. Results of the linear mixed-effect model used to evaluate a diverse range of variables revealed that the only predictors for this hotspot were the short distance from land and great bottom depth. No clear differences in demographic composition for the study area were detected, which indicates that the area is highly dynamic and dominated by flux and advection of krill, both to, from, and within the area. Despite this finding, the results demonstrate that the shelf break on the northwest South Orkney Islands is predictable over time as a krill concentration and retention hotspot during the summer season.

The experimental parameters of LID are optimized by response surface methodology (RSM), and the optima are obtained as follows; laser power (10 W), irradiation time (5 min), and sample volume (3 g). The results show that a total of 41 volatile molecular species are detected, including six alcohols, 10 aldehydes, five ketones, 14 hydrocarbons, and six other compounds. Compared with the conventional heating assisted desorption technique, the LID can release volatile molecular species with higher abundance in a considerably reduced extraction time from 30 to 5 min. Finally, the proposed method is validated in terms of sensitivity, precision, linearity, and recovery, which demonstrate its advantages of high efficiency and simplified procedure. Practical Applications: An LID method is developed using a 450 nm blue semiconductor laser for analyzing the flavor of Antarctic krill oil (E. superba). Compared with the conventional heating assisted desorption technique, the LID can release more volatile molecular species with higher abundance in a considerably shorter extraction time, and the intensive laser power does not induce the autoxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acids. It shows the advantages of a highly efficient, and simplified procedure.																	1438-7697	1438-9312				APR	2019	121	4							1800446	10.1002/ejlt.201800446							WOS:000462920600019

Persistent organohalogen contaminant burdens in Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) from the eastem Antarctic sector: A baseline study	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												A baseline for persistent organohalogen compound (POC) accumulation in the Antarctic keystone species, Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) has been established fora 50 degrees longitudinal range of the eastern Antarctic sector. Samples of adult krill, caught from 12 sites distributed between 30 degrees and 80 degrees E (60-70 degrees S), were analysed for > 100 organohalogen compounds including chlorinated pesticides, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polybrominated organic compounds and polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins/furans (PCDD/Fs). Organochlorine pesticides dominated measured krill contaminant burdens with hexachlorobenzene (HCB) as the single most abundant compound quantified. Krill HCB concentrations were comparable to those detected at this trophic level in both the Arctic and temperate northwest Atlantic, lending support for the hypothesis that HCB will approach global equilibrium at a faster rate than other POCs. Para, para'-dichlorodiphenylethene (p,p'-DDE) was detected at notable concentrations. Measurements of DDT and its degradation products provide an important baseline for monitoring the temporal and geographical influence of renewed, DDT usage for malaria-control in affected southern hemisphere countries. In contrast to the Arctic, PCBs did not feature prominently in contaminant burdens of Antarctic krill. The major commercial polybrominated diphenyl ether (PBDE) congeners -99 and -47 were quantified at low background levels with clear concentration spikes observed at around 70 degrees E, in the vicinity of modem, active research stations. The likelihood that local anthropogenic activities are supplementing low PBDE levels, delivered otherwise primarily via long range environmental transport, is discussed. The suspected naturally occurring brominated organic compound, 2,4,6-tribromoanisole (TBA), was a ubiquitous contaminant in all samples whereas the only PCDD/Fs quantifiable were trace levels of octachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (OCDD) and 1,2,3,4,7,8/1,2,3,4,7,9-hexachlorodibenzofuran (HxCDF). With the aims of, i) Generating a robust and broadly applicable POC auditing platform for the scarcely studied eastern Antarctic sector; ii) Determining the compounds accumulating in Antarctic krill for further toxicity evaluation studies and iii) Establishing a baseline for Antarctic predator exposure to POCs, this study represents one of the most comprehensive reports of POC contamination of the Antarctic food web to date.

In situ measurements were made of dorsal aspect target strength (TS) and, as krill moved into the near-surface layer (0-15 m), in situ measurements were made of lateral-aspect TS. The probability density function (PDF) of TS measurements made with the down-looking transducer had a mode at approximately - 73 dB.

Its central position in the food web, the ongoing environmental changes due to climatic warming, and increasing commercial interest on this species emphasize the urgency of understanding the adaptability of krill to its environment. Krill has evolved rhythmic physiological and behavioral functions which are synchronized with the daily and seasonal cycles of the complex Southern Ocean ecosystem. The mechanisms, however, leading to these rhythms are essentially unknown. Here, we show that krill possesses an endogenous circadian clock that governs metabolic and physiological output rhythms. We found that expression of the canonical clock gene cry2 was highly rhythmic both in a light-dark cycle and in constant darkness. We detected a remarkable short circadian period, which we interpret as a special feature of the krill's circadian clock that helps to entrain the circadian system to the extreme range of photoperiods krill is exposed to throughout the year. Furthermore, we found that important key metabolic enzymes of krill showed bimodal circadian oscillations (similar to 9-12 h period) in transcript abundance and enzymatic activity. Oxygen consumption of krill showed similar to 9-12 h oscillations that correlated with the temporal activity profile of key enzymes of aerobic energy metabolism. Our results demonstrate the first report of an endogenous circadian timing system in Antarctic krill and its likely link to metabolic key processes. Krill's circadian clock may not only be critical for synchronization to the solar day but also for the control of seasonal events. This study provides a powerful basis for the investigation into the mechanisms of temporal synchronization in this marine key species and will also lead to the first comprehensive analyses of the circadian clock of a polar marine organism through the entire photoperiodic cycle.

Only four species, Alluroteuthis antarcticus, Galiteuthis glacialis, Martialia hyadesi and Psychroteuthis glacialis, contained material which was identifiable to species visually. Myctophid fish and euphausiids were the most common prey item. Serology showed that specimens of six species had eaten euphausiids. Where antisera showed cross-reactions with other potential prey species, biogeographical and haul data was used to determine the species of Euphausia consumed. P. glacialis (n = 19) had consumed E. superba. Mastigoteuthis psychrophila (n = 10) had eaten E. superba and/or E. triacantha. Brachioteuthis picta (n = 6), M. hyadesi (n = 27), and two Moroteuthis spp. (n = 2) had consumed unidentified euphausiids. Bathyteuthis abyssicola (n = 13) and Histioteuthis eltaninae (n = 13) had not preyed on euphausiids.

Cluster analysis of the fatty acid data revealed 3 regionally distinct groups of krill. Group A consisted primarily of subadults (median length 42 mm) and was characterised by high proportions of 14:0, 16:0 and 18:1 (n-9) fatty acids. Group B comprised mainly juveniles and a small proportion of adults (median length 33 mm) and had a fatty acid profile similar to that of Group A. The largest group, Group C (8 of 14 stations, mostly to the east of the survey area), was almost exclusively juveniles plus a small number of sub-adults (median length 29 mm) and had unusually high percentages of polyunsaturated fatty acids [PUFA; 18:4(n-3), 20:5(n-3) and 22:6(n-3)]. Krill from Group C had the lowest total fatty acid concentrations (150 to 722 mg kg(-1)). These krill were surviving on the lowest algal biomass in the region and had probably resorted to carnivory on PUFA rich copepods. The pattern of fatty acids in krill from Groups A and B resembled that of krill collected from a diatom bloom in the Bellingshausen Sea, but the concentrations were generally lower. The well fed krill from the Bellingshausen Sea showed small variations in fatty acid content associated with sex and maturity, but the South Georgia results indicated that diet can have a greater impact on fatty acid content than sex and maturity stages. Fatty acid profiles were indicative of food regimes that were so distinct that the krill probably originated from spatially independent groups.																	0171-8630	1616-1599					1999	181						177	188		10.3354/meps181177							WOS:000080772700015

Information on krill condition during winter and early spring is slowly evolving with our enhanced ability to sample at this time of year. However, because of the limited spatial and temporal data, our understanding of fundamental biological parameters for krill during winter is limited. Our study assessed the condition of larval (furcilia VI) and one year old juvenile krill collected in East Antarctica (116 degrees E-130 degrees E and 64 degrees S-66 degrees S) from September to October 2012. Krill condition was assessed using morphometric, elemental and biochemical body composition, growth rates, oxygen uptake and lipid content and composition. Diet was assessed using fatty acid biomarkers analysed in the krill. The growth rate of larvae was 0.0038 mm day with an inter-moult period of 14 days. The average oxygen uptake of juvenile krill was 0.30 +/- 0.02 mu l oxygen consumed per mg dry weight per hour. Although protein was not significantly different amongst the krill analysed, the lipid content of krill was highly variable ranging from 9% to 27% dry weight in juveniles and from 4% to 13% dry weight in larvae. Specific algal biomarkers, fatty acids ratios, levels of both long-chain (>= C-20) monounsaturated fatty acids and bacterial fatty acids found in krill were indicative of the mixed nature of dietary sources and the opportunistic feeding capability of larval and juvenile krill at the end of winter.

Knowledge of the lipid biochemistry of krill assists in understanding their seasonal biology and predicting their responses to ecological changes. We collected daily samples of krill from a commercial fishing vessel operating in the Atlantic Sector of the Southern Ocean from 2014 to 2016. We analysed the total lipid content of krill sampled every two weeks and the relative distribution of lipid class levels to examine seasonal trends. Krill total lipid content varied significantly within and between seasons and sexes. An annual sinusoidal trend was seen in total lipid content with the highest values in autumn and the lowest in spring (average 380 and 87 mg/g dry mass, respectively). Total lipids in krill increased during summer, peaking in autumn, with the total lipids in winter individuals decreasing towards spring. The relative distribution of lipid class levels varied between season and year. Levels of triacylglycerol showed the same seasonal trend as total lipid content, whilst phospholipid showed the inverse trend indicating the contrasting roles of these two dominant lipid classes. These data provide high-resolution information on the seasonality of krill lipid content and composition. This information has both ecological and commercial utility.

Modelling the effects of UV radiation on the survival of Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba Dana) in the face of limited data	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING												Antarctic krill, Euphausia superba, is a keystone species of the Antarctic ecosystem. A fishery for krill may compete with land-based predators (penguins and seals), particularly during the breeding season. The Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR) is moving towards management in small scale units. The management models specify predation and fishing mortality as space and time dependent but do not yet include non-predation natural mortality. Krill are known to be highly susceptible to ultraviolet radiation (UV) but there are limited empirical data. We develop a model for krill mortality caused by UV and parameterize and assess it by comparison with experimental data. The analysis allows us to identify key parameters that should be measured in future experiments and also leads to suggestions about modification of experimental procedure. We illustrate the method for krill found in the Livingston Island area and show that (a) it is possible to estimate the component of natural mortality due to UV-induced damage and (b) that cohorts born in 1979, 1984, or 1997 have different survival in the first 5 years of life, associated with differential UV exposure. In particular, those born in 1997 may have experienced as much as 10% lower survival than those born in 1979. The method developed here allows a potentially important source of krill mortality to be incorporated into the management models and suggests key experiments and field work in the future.

J	FARBERLORDA, J				FARBERLORDA, J			LENGTH-WEIGHT RELATIONSHIPS AND COEFFICIENT OF CONDITION OF EUPHAUSIA-SUPERBA AND THYSANOESSA-MACRURA (CRUSTACEA, EUPHAUSIACEA) IN SOUTHWEST INDIAN-OCEAN DURING SUMMER	MARINE BIOLOGY												Samples of antarctic euphausiids, Euphausia superba and Thysanoessa macrura were obtained during the MD 25 FIBEX expedition of the R. V. ''Marion Dufresne'', in February 1981, to the southwest Indian Ocean. Individual and mean coefficients of condition (K(m)) were calculated from variations in weight as a function of total length and of carapace length. In E. superba, no significant differences were found as a function of sex or development stage in either total length and weight or carapace length and weight. In T. macrura, a significant allometric difference emerged in the wet weight of juveniles, males and females as a function of total length, and in wet weight as a function of carapace length between adults and subadults. In both E. superba and T. macrura, wet weight as a function of total length differed significantly among stations, and also between species, with a greater weight increase for T. macrura in summer. The coefficients of condition calculated for all wet weight-total length relationships showed that the morphologically different Group II males were heavier than Group I males and mature females. K(m) in T. macrura was higher for females than for juveniles or males, indicating a greater weight gain by the females. These differences probably reflect real differences in physiology and may affect the distribution of these two species.																	0025-3162	1432-1793				MAR	1994	118	4					645	650		10.1007/BF00347512							WOS:A1994NE90100014

Here, we compare biomass, growth and production of Euphausia superba (Antarctic krill) and the copepod Calanoides acutus at South Georgia, in the Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean. Average acoustically derived krill biomass across the 5 study years was 2.6 g C m(-2), 4 to 5 times that of Stages CIV and CV of C. acutus. Mean length of krill was 41 +/- 4 mm, and the average growth rate was 0.10 mm d(-1), giving an average mass-specific growth rate of 0.0084 d(-1). This equated to a daily gross production of krill of 0.022 g C m(-2) d(-1). Gross production of Stages CIV and CV of C. acutus was similar, around 0.026 g C m(-2) d-1. These stages of C. acutus represent about 25% of the total copepod biomass around South Georgia, so total copepod production here may exceed that of krill by a factor of 4 during the productive summer months. Biomass of copepods and krill in other parts of the Southern Ocean differ by similar orders of magnitude, whilst growth rates are likely to remain within the range measured in this study. Therefore, our finding has relevance outside the local South Georgia system. All of the krill production is likely to be rapidly consumed by higher predators within the surface layers, whilst it is estimated that around 17% of copepod production may be sequestered at depth during winter diapause.																	0171-8630	1616-1599					2005	298						229	239		10.3354/meps298229							WOS:000231905600020

Abundance and distribution of Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) nearshore of Cape Shirreff, Livingston Island, Antarctica, during six austral summers between 2000 and 2007	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												Abundance and distribution of Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) in the nearshore waters north of Livingston Island, Antarctica, were characterized from six small-boat surveys conducted in late January or early February from 2000 to 2007. The first three surveys (2000, 2002, 2004) were conducted using a 120 kHz split-beam echosounder to measure water column acoustic backscatter. The last three surveys (2005-2007) were conducted using 38 kHz and 200 kHz singlebeam echosounders. A portion of the acoustic backscatter was attributed to Antarctic krill based on the results of net tows, underwater video observations, and a multiple-frequency acoustic classification algorithm. The annual mean krill biomass density in the survey area ranged from 11 to 84 g.m(-2). Results are compared with the western Scotia Sea area of the US Antarctic Marine Living Resources (AMLR) program's acoustic surveys of krill biomass density for the same years. Near-shore krill biomass densities were significantly larger (t test, p < 0.05), more stable, and the coefficients of variation were smaller than the much larger AMLR surveys. Increased competition between seals, penguins, and humans for the nearshore krill resource, especially during the austral summer months, could impact the recruitment success of these land-based krill predators. Implications of nearshore krill biomass on small-scale management units are discussed.

Flexibility in Antarctic krill Euphausia superba decouples diet and recruitment from overwinter sea-ice conditions in the northern Antarctic Peninsula	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												Winter sea-ice conditions are considered important for Antarctic krill Euphausia superba survival and recruitment, yet few broad-scale longitudinal studies have examined the underlying relationships between winter conditions and krill recruitment. We used data from a 4 yr winter study of krill condition (lipid content), diet (stable isotopes and fatty acids), and length distributions around the northern Antarctic Peninsula to examine relationships among environmental variables (annual sea-ice cover, water column chlorophyll a [chl a], and upper mixed-layer water temperature), the condition and diet of krill, and recruitment success the following year. Diet indicators (lipid content, delta N-15, delta C-1(3), and the fatty acid ratios 16:1n-7/18:4n-3 and 18:1n-9/18:1n-7) in post-larvae were consistent among years regardless of sea-ice cover, suggesting that post-larval krill do not rely on sea-ice resources for overwinter survival. Diet indicators in larvae were more variable and suggest that larvae may feed on sea-ice resources when they are available but can still persist in the water column when they are not. Principal component analysis between environmental variables and diet indicators showed that water-column chl a was the only variable that significantly affected diet, regardless of annual changes in sea-ice cover. Extensive winter ice in one year did not translate into successful recruitment the following year. Krill demonstrate a high degree of flexibility with respect to overwinter habitat and diet, and the degree to which sea ice is important during different times of year and at different life stages may be more complex than previously thought.																	0171-8630	1616-1599				MAY 28	2020	642						1	19		10.3354/meps13325							WOS:000545930000001

Since krill abundance is a crucial factor in Antarctic ecosystem functioning, its monitoring supplies vital data. Acoustic surveys are an effective approach to estimating krill abundance. An acoustic survey was conducted in the western Ross Sea in January 2014-10 years after a similar survey by our team - to estimate krill abundance and biomass and monitor oceanographic conditions. Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) was detected in the northern part of the western Ross Sea and dense swarms of ice krill (Euphausia crystallorophias) were found in its central coastal area. Data analysis revealed an inverse correlation between E. superba density and salinity in the water column, whereas a positive correlation was found between E. crystallorophias abundance and fluorescence; the latter relationship was confirmed in thematic maps of E. crystallorophias spatial distribution and fluorescence. Comparison of 2004 and 2014 biomass data showed a much greater abundance of both species in the more recent survey. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The specificity of the affinity-purified antibody (immunoglobulin G type) obtained from the serum was examined, using other glycosphingolipids and glyco-proteins structurally related to MlOse2Cer, by means of ELISA and TLC-immunostaining. The purified antibody was highly specific to MlOse2Cer and lacked reactivity with other glycolipids and glycoproteins including glucosylceramide, lactosylceramide, dimannosylglucosylceramide (MlOse3Cer), glucosaminylmannosylglucosylceramide (ArOse3Cer), thyroglobulin and alpha-1-acid glycoprotein. The antibody was found to bind, although less efficiently, to certain other compounds containing the group Man-beta-1-4Glc and/or Man-beta-1-4GlcNAc at their termini, such as MlOse2-sphingosine and Man-beta-1-4GlcNAc-beta-1-p-aminobenzoic acid ethylester derivatives. The present antibody was applied to the detection of the natural hapten in crustacean glycolipids. The purified antibody reacted with a neutral glycosphingolipid present in the two kinds of crustacean, Euphausia superba (antarctic krill) and Macrobrachium nipponense (fresh-water shrimp) as shown by TLC-immunostaining. The crustacean glycolipid antigen was isolated and characterized to be the Man-beta-1-4Glc-Cer.

The high concentrations of the species and its possible uses-food for human and animal consumption and in the production of industrial, pharmaceutical and dietetic products-generates interest in the fishing industry. Its relevance motivated the implementation of administrative measures and international regulations for this fishery, which are summarized in this review. Chile is the only South American fishing country that has shown interest in participating in Antarctic krill fishery. Thus, between 1983 and 1994, the Fisheries Development Institute and some companies carried out fishing activities mainly aimed at prospecting and researching this species. However, starting in 2011, the factory trawler FV Betanzos began sustained commercial krill fishing aimed at krill meal production. This document analyzes the information collected by said vessel between 2011 and 2016, including areas of operation, fishing depth catches and CPUE obtained. Also, the main challenges faced by this fishery and the actions planned as solutions are assessed.																	0718-560X	0717-7178					2020	48	2					179	196		10.3856/vol48-issue2-fulltext-2408							WOS:000532474500002

Egg-release behaviour in Antarctic krill	POLAR BIOLOGY												The process of egg release is a complex and crucial step in the life cycle of euphausiids, especially with regards mortality and recruitment success. We examined this process in Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) in terms of the functioning of the female genital apparatus and associated swimming behaviour. A tethering technique combined with video analysis was used to make observations of three females during the release process. We found eggs were steadily extruded over a period of up to 10 h, during which time the krill released between 1,600 and 4,000 eggs and the ovary reduced by a half in length and a third in height. Eggs were mainly released individually or, less commonly, in batches of between 2 and 4 eggs. Release rates were between 5 and 30 eggs min(-1). The steady release of eggs fits well with histological evidence that mature oocytes must pass individually through tight genital ducts with narrow apertures, before coming in to close contact with the sperm plug for fertilisation, and then expulsion from the thelycum as fertilised eggs. During spawning, the female alternated between slow and rapid rates of pleopod beating with egg release occurring at the moment of beat acceleration. At the point of release, the descent of the egg was accelerated through downward beats of the 7th thoracic leg. The cyclic pattern in pleopod beat-rate during spawning may alter swimming performance and contribute to the widely reported sex- and maturity-based biases within krill swarms.

This pattern implies high potential for differentiation in benthic shelf species with limited dispersal, yet consequences for pelagic organisms are less clear. The present study investigates levels of genetic variation and population structure of the Antarctic krill Euphausia superba using mitochondrial DNA and EST-linked microsatellite markers for an unprecedentedly comprehensive sampling of its populations over a circum-Antarctic range. Results: MtDNA (ND1) sequences and EST-linked microsatellite markers indicated no clear sign of genetic structure among populations over large geographic scales, despite considerable power to detect differences inferred from forward-time simulations. Based on ND1, few instances of genetic heterogeneity, not significant after correction for multiple tests, were detected between geographic or temporal samples. Neutrality tests and mismatch distribution based on mtDNA sequences revealed strong evidence of past population expansion. Significant positive values of the parameter g (a measure of population growth) were obtained from microsatellite markers using a coalescent-based genealogical method and suggested a recent start (60 000 - 40 000 years ago) for the expansion. Conclusions: The results provide evidence of lack of genetic heterogeneity of Antarctic krill at large geographic scales and unequivocal support for recent population expansion. Lack of genetic structuring likely reflects the tight link between krill and circum-Antarctic ocean currents and is consistent with the hypothesis that differentiation processes in Antarctic species are largely influenced by dispersal potential, whereas small-scale spatial and temporal differentiation might be due to local conditions leading to genetic patchiness. The signal of recent population growth suggests differential impact of glacial cycles on pelagic Antarctic species, which experienced population expansion during glaciations with increased available habitat, versus sedentary benthic shelf species. EST-linked microsatellites provide new perspectives to complement the results based on mtDNA and suggest that data-mining of EST libraries will be a useful approach to facilitate use of microsatellites for additional species.

Protozoans as a food source for Antarctic krill, Euphausia superba: Complementary insights from stomach content, fatty acids, and stable isotopes	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												We studied the diet of Antarctic krill, Euphausia superba, at five stations across the southwest Atlantic sector in summer 2003 by analyzing stomach content, fatty acids, and stable isotopes on the same individuals. Our aim was to examine what each method could contribute to our understanding of krill nutrition and whether differences seen in growth rates were linked to their food. All three methods indicated clear regional differences in diet, but small ontogenetic and sex-related differences. Overall, diatoms were the most abundant item in the stomach, but at three of the stations, tintinnids, large dinoflagellates, and other armored flagellates dominated the identifiable biomass. Copepod remains were rare. Fatty acids profiles gave additional information about feeding on weakly silicified diatoms and athecate heterotrophic dinoflagellates, with the latter being the main food source at one of the stations. Two independent indices of carnivory, delta N-15 and the fatty acid ratio 18:1(n-9)/18:1(n-7), were correlated among krill from the same swarm, suggesting consistent differences in diet between individuals. An internal index of trophic position, (i.e., delta N-15(glutamic) (acid)-delta N-15(phenylalanine)) underlined the importance of heterotrophic food for the nutrition of krill, even in summer. Highest growth rates of krill were found during a diatom bloom and coincided with a mixed diet, large digestive gland, and fast stomach passage. However, even in a nonbloom, flagellate-dominated system, krill were able to sustain medium growth rates when feeding on heterotrophic dinoflagellates. Each method supplied specific information on krill nutrition, and the true picture is only revealed when the various methods are used together.

Physical processes control the extent of ice cover, the magnitude and location of food, and the distribution of pack ice predators; however, physical processes did not appear to directly affect krill. Instead, the seasonal distribution and behavior of krill was interpreted to be a function of the need to acquire food and avoid predators. These 2 factors also are hypothesized to be the proximate cause of swarming during our study. Seasonal sea ice plays an integral role in the ecology of krill. Ice-edge blooms are an important and predictable food supply, particularly for reproducing adults and first-feeding larvae. Ice floes provide protection for larvae and juveniles, and sea ice biota, a widespread food source, are important to the survival of larvae during winter. In the marginal ice zone, overwintering strategies of adults included regression to an immature (sub-adult) stage, reduction of metabolic rate, and omnivorous feeding in the water column. Adults were not observed feeding on the undersurface of ice floes probably because of increased risk of predation from pack ice predators. However, adult krill may migrate deeper into the pack ice in winter and also feed on ice biota. We conclude that sea ice biota act as a stabilizing mechanism against extreme seasonal oscillations of food supply for overwintering krill, thus contributing to the persistence of populations of E. superba.																	0171-8630					DEC	1991	79	1-2					37	66		10.3354/meps079037							WOS:A1991HF03400004

Euphausia superba, in the central part of the Indian sector of the Southern Ocean. e.g., the Cooperation Sea (Prydz Bay region) and the Cosmonaut Sea, during austral summers 1977-1990 were summarized to estimate growth rates, longevity, reproduction, recruitment, life span, and mortality rates. The life span of Antarctic krill exceeds 5 years in both the Cosmonaut and Cooperation seas. The age composition of the southern and northern groupings differs markedly, with substantial reduction in numbers of early ape groups in the northern grouping. Long-term observations of spawning success, recruitment, and age composition suggest that a self-sustained grouping of krill persists in the Cooperation Sea south of the Antarctic Divergence. How ever, periodic gene flow via recruits from surrounding regions most probably accounts for the lack of spatial genetic differences between the Cooperation Sea and adjacent areas, thus preventing the establishment of an isolated subpopulation in the region investigated. The major factor responsible for the substantial interannual variability in krill dynamics appears to be macroscale oceanographic and atmospheric circulations. which determine a level of environmental isolation of the Cooperation Sea from adjacent waters.																	0706-652X						2000	57			3			68	90		10.1139/cjfas-57-S3-68							WOS:000166531600009

In particular, seasonal changes in environmental light regimes have been shown to strongly influence krill metabolism, representing control signals for seasonal regulation of physiology of this key Southern Ocean species. Here, we report the identification of a cryptochrome gene, a cardinal component of the clockwork machinery in several organisms. EsCRY appears to be an ortholog of mammalian-like CRYs and clusters with the insect CRY2 subfamily. EsCRY has the canonical bipartite CRY structure, with a conserved N-terminal domain and a highly divergent C-terminus, that bears several binding motifs, some of them shared with insect CRY2 and others peculiar for EsCRY. We have evaluated the temporal expression of Escry both at mRNA and protein levels in individuals harvested from the Ross Sea at different times throughout the 24 h cycle during the Antarctic summer. We observed a daily fluctuation in abundance for Escry mRNA in the head, with high levels around 06: 00 h, which is not mirrored by a cycle in the corresponding protein. Our findings represent a first step toward establishing the presence of an endogenous circadian time-keeping mechanism that might allow this organism to synchronize its physiology and behavior to the Antarctic light regimes.

J	Richerson, K; Santora, JA; Mangel, M				Richerson, Kate; Santora, Jarrod A.; Mangel, Marc			Climate variability and multi-scale assessment of the krill preyscape near the north Antarctic Peninsula	POLAR BIOLOGY												Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) densities vary in space and time across multiple scales, with consequences for krill predators, the krill fishery, and management decisions. We use acoustic data collected from 1997 to 2011 around the South Shetland Islands near the northern Antarctic Peninsula to quantify spatiotemporal patterns in krill biomass, distribution, and patchiness both within and across years. Moreover, we evaluate potential climate drivers of krill biomass and spatial organization through comparison with seasonally lagged climate indices. Krill abundance varied by an order of magnitude throughout the study period, with mean biomass ranging from a high of 171.9 g m(-2) in 1997 to a low of 9.4 g m(-2) in 2002. We find that across years, krill abundance and variability are correlated with seasonally averaged measures of El Nio-Southern Oscillation at lags of approximately 2-2.5 years, which may correspond to strong reproduction and recruitment events. Krill biomass shows generally weak to moderate spatial autocorrelation and high aggregation, with measures of spatial organization correlated with abundance in some habitats. Within years, there was an overall trend of declining krill abundance and/or detectability and contracted spatial distribution between midsummer and late summer, but this pattern was not consistent across all years. This synthesis provides the background to model krill prey landscapes in order to better understand regional foraging ecology of krill predators and fishery performance.

These aggregations may be structured to allow individuals to sense the hydrodynamic cues of neighboring krill or to avoid the flow fields of neighboring krill, which may increase drag forces on an individual krill. To determine the strength and location of the flow disturbance generated by krill, we used infrared particle image velocimetry measurements to analyze the flow field of free-swimming solitary specimens (Euphausia superba and Euphausia pacifica) and small, coordinated groups of three to six E. superba. Euphausia pacifica individuals possessed shorter body lengths, steeper body orientations relative to horizontal, slower swimming speeds and faster pleopod beat frequencies compared with E. superba. The downward-directed flow produced by E. pacifica has a smaller maximum velocity and smaller horizontal extent of the flow pattern compared with the flow produced by E. superba, which suggests that the flow disturbance is less persistent as a potential hydrodynamic cue for E. pacifica. Time record analysis reveals that the hydrodynamic disturbance is very weak beyond two body lengths for E. pacifica, whereas the hydrodynamic disturbance is observable above background level at four body lengths for E. superba. Because the nearest neighbor separation distance of E. superba within a school is less than two body lengths, hydrodynamic disturbances are a viable cue for intraspecies communication. The orientation of the position of the nearest neighbor is not coincident with the orientation of the flow disturbance, however, which indicates that E. superba are avoiding the region of strongest flow.

The selectivity of the utilized netting depends on the sizes and opening angles of the mesh. The effects of the mesh size and mesh opening angle on the fishing selectivity of Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) were assessed via micro-cosmos experiments. The results show that both the absolute abundance and the incidence of larger krill individuals passing through experimental panels are proportional to the utilized mesh size. Krill individuals larger than 35 mm passed through experimental panels at mesh opening angles larger than 50 degrees for a 15 mm mesh size, 35 degrees for a 20 mm mesh size and 20 degrees for a 30 mm mesh size. Additionally, all L50 values increased with an increasing mesh size and an increasing mesh opening angle at the same mesh size. Furthermore, the selection range increased with an increasing mesh size and with an increasing mesh opening angle at the same mesh size. This paper provides scientific guidance for the choice of liner mesh sizes of krill trawl with the aim to improve fishing efficiency while minimizing fishing losses and potential negative ecosystem impacts from fisheries.																		2077-1312				APR	2021	9	4							372	10.3390/jmse9040372							WOS:000643122500001						
J	Ju, SJ; Harvey, HR				Ju, SJ; Harvey, HR			Lipids as markers of nutritional condition and diet in the Antarctic krill Euphausia superba and Euphausia crystallorophias during austral winter	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY												To understand the nutritional condition and feeding history of Antarctic krill during winter, Euphausia superba and E. crystallorophias were collected by MOCNESS during July August 2001 in Maguerite Bay southeast of Adelaide Island. Total lipid, lipid classes, fatty acids, fatty alcohols and sterols were analyzed in animals among several life stages. Lipids in seston and major copepods representing potential diets were collected from the water column and quantified to compare with krill. Stomach contents also were examined in selected adult krill to provide a visual snapshot of ingested material and comparison with lipid biomarkers. Total lipids in adult E. crystallorophias were significantly higher than adult E. superba (30.0% and 20.2% of dry weight, respectively). Wax esters were the major storage lipid in E. crystallorophias, accounting for over half (mean of 55.9%) of the total lipid in adult animals. In contrast, K superba contained triacylglycerols as the dominant storage lipid in adults (mean of 45.5% of total lipid). Fatty acid and sterol distributions in krill showed minor differences between species and life stages. Larval krill, however, contained higher polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) than sub- and adult krill. While only trace amounts of fatty alcohols were found in E superba, significant amounts were found in E. crystallorophias, particularly 14:0 and 16:0, which were major components of wax esters. Results for lipid classes, individual lipids, and stomach content suggest that E superba is less dependent on stored lipid for overwintering than E crystallorophias. E superba are omnivorous, with copepods representing a significant dietary source for adults in winter. Furciliae of both species contain lower levels of lipid storage in winter and feed largely on detritus or organisms associated with ice. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Tissue fluoride accumulation and kidney lesions in freshwater-reared Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) fed with high dietary fluoride concentrations	AQUACULTURE NUTRITION												Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) and other marine zooplankton may contain high levels of fluoride. The aim of the present experiment was to determine whether dietary fluoride from Antarctic krill at levels similar to the old and the new EU allowable limits in fish feeds (150 and 350 mg kg-1) would induce kidney lesions in freshwater-reared Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar). In addition to the diets containing krill, two high-sodium fluoride (NaF) diets (1500 and 3500 mg kg-1) were used to investigate the effect on growth, feed intake, faecal excretion of minerals and accumulation of fluoride in various tissues. No major effects on growth or feed intake were observed. A higher proportion of the ingested fluoride was absorbed in salmon fed with the NaF diets compared with fish fed with krill shell diets. Fluoride accumulated in liver, kidney and especially bone. Faecal excretion of calcium and magnesium was higher for the NaF-fed fish compared with fish fed with the control and krill shell diets, whereas the levels of these minerals in plasma were unaffected. Dietary fluoride from krill shells did not induce kidney lesions. One-third of the salmon fed with the highest NaF diet showed signs of crystal formation within the distal tubules and/or collecting ducts in the kidney.

The arrangement of the test includes two observers, four magnifications (from 7.5x to 62.5x) whenever feasible and two replications of each measurement. A total of 953 measurements were analyzed in an incomplete random blocks ANOVA design not finding significant differences between magnifications, methods, observers and their interactions. It was found that the relative differences between methods were of the same magnitude as the differences between replications (approximately 5%). The proposed method is less demanding on laboratory work, thus allowing the measurement of the large number of specimens needed to estimate size frequency distributions.																	0722-4060					MAR	2011	34	3					455	458		10.1007/s00300-010-0885-x							WOS:000288349800014

This dataset allowed comparison between seasons, years (2013-2016), and different fishing locations. Quantities of omega 3 fatty acids 20: 5n-3 and 22: 6n-3 (mg/g dry mass; DM) were highest in autumn and decreased through winter to reach a spring low. Quantities of the flagellate marker 18: 4n-3 and diatom marker 16: 1n-7c were variable and did not display the same seasonal fluctuations. In summer, krill had high percentages (% total fatty acids) of 20: 5n-3 and 22: 6n-3, total PUFA, and low 18: 1n-9c/18: 1n-7c ratios, indicating a more herbivorous diet. Krill became more omnivorous from autumn to spring, indicated by increasing ratios of 18: 1n-9c/18: 1n-7c and percentages of Sigma 20: 1 + 22: 1 isomers. Bacterial fatty acids (Sigma C-15 + C-17 + C-19 isomers) were minor components year-round (0.9-1.8 %). Seasonal levels of herbivory and omnivory differed between years, and levels of specific fatty acid ratios differed between fishing locations. The fatty acid 18: 4n-3 was a major driver of variability in krill fatty acid composition, with no obvious seasonal driver. This is the first study to report krill fatty acid data during all four seasons over consecutive years. This large-scale study highlights the value of using fisheries samples to examine seasonal and annual fluctuations in krill diet and condition.

A serine proteinase isolated from E. superba shows collagenolytic properties: it acts on collagens from Achilles tendon (type I and V) and reconstituted fibrils of calf skin collagen under conditions that do not denature the substrates. 2. At 25-degrees-C and pH 7.5 the enzyme both splits the calf skin collagen in solution to the fragments TC(A) and TC(B) and catalyses the conversion of dimeric molecules to monomeric chains. 3. The enzyme exhibits strong chymotrypsin-like and lower trypsin-like activities. 4. All the enzyme activities are inhibited to the same degree by diisopropylfluorophosphate (DFP), phenylmethylsulphonyl fluoride (PMSF), N-alpha-tosyl-L-lysine chloromethyl ketone (TLCK), soybean trypsin inhibitor (SBTI), chicken ovomucoid (CHOM), chymostatin and leupeptin. None of the activities is inhibited by chelating agents and L-cysteine. 5. pH-Optima of the proteinase in protein substrates hydrolysis (6.0-6.2) are lower than those of synthetic substrates cleavage (7.8-8.0 in the case of BzTyrOEt and 8.7-8.9 for BzArgOEt). 6. Four from nine cysteine residues present in the enzyme molecule possess free thiol-groups. Since the enzyme is inhibited by p-chloromercuribenzoate (pCMB), N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) and iodoacetic acid (IAA), the role of its thiol-groups has been discussed.

Distribution and demography of Antarctic krill in the Southeast Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean during the austral summer 2008	POLAR BIOLOGY												This study documents horizontal distribution and demography of Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) from the Southern Ocean during January-March 2008. The cruise predominantly occurred in CCAMLR Subarea 48.6, where knowledge about the ecosystem is limited. E. superba were not found north of 52A degrees S. The biomass, estimated from trawl catches, was highest (63.09 g/m(2)) at a station 680 km southeast of Bouvetoya and at two stations 1,400 and 600 km southeast and southwest of Bouvetoya, 54.67 and 61.38 g/m(2), respectively. Body length ranged from 19 to 61 mm (N = 8,538), with a mean of 42.0 +/- A 6.4 mm (SD). The overall sex ratio was 1:1, 46.2% males (13.2% adults and 33.0% subadults), 46.1% females (33.6% adults and 12.5% subadults), while 7.5% were juveniles. Trawl stations dominated by adults were found west and north of Bouvetoya. Stations with high proportions of subadults and juveniles were mainly found southeast of the island. Four cluster groups were differentiated: analyzing data on krill sex proportions, maturity stages, hydrography, nutrients and chlorophyll concentrations. Two groups represented stations located in the northern part of the study area, where E. superba were absent; water temperatures were higher and the nutrient concentrations lower compared to the groups where E. superba were present. This study shows that bathymetric features like the North Weddell Ridge including Bouvetoya are important for concentrating krill probably due to water mass characteristics and advective processes which influence regional krill demography. The southern regions of CCAMLR sector 48.6 are essential for understanding regional krill recruitment and production.

A.			Size and stage composition of age class 0 Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) in the ice-water interface layer during winter/early spring	POLAR BIOLOGY												The condition and survival of Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) strongly depends on sea ice conditions during winter. How krill utilize sea ice depends on several factors such as region and developmental stage. A comprehensive understanding of sea ice habitat use by krill, however, remains largely unknown. The aim of this study was to improve the understanding of the krill's interaction with the sea ice habitat during winter/early spring by conducting large-scale sampling of the ice-water interface (0-2 m) and comparing the size and developmental stage composition of krill with the pelagic population (0-500 m). Results show that the population in the northern Weddell Sea consisted mainly of krill that were <1 year old (age class 0; AC0), and that it was comprised of multiple cohorts. Size per developmental stage differed spatially, indicating that the krill likely were advected from various origins. The size distribution of krill differed between the two depth strata sampled. Larval stages with a relatively small size (mean 7-8 mm) dominated the upper two metre layer of the water column, while larger larvae and AC0 juveniles (mean 14-15 mm) were proportionally more abundant in the 0- to 500-m stratum. Our results show that, as krill mature, their vertical distribution and utilization of the sea ice appear to change gradually. This could be the result of changes in physiology and/or behaviour, as, e.g., the krill's energy demand and swimming capacity increase with size and age. The degree of sea ice association will have an effect on large-scale spatial distribution patterns of AC0 krill and on predictions of the consequences of sea ice decline on their survival over winter.

This is the lowest GC% recorded for a metazoan. Low GC% DNA has high concentrations of thymine (T) residues and consequently a greater abundance of adjacent T residues [T(n) arrays]. Ultraviolet B (280-320 nm, W-B) radiation damages DNA primarily at (T)n arrays, so we suggest that krill DNA may be more susceptible to damage from increased levels of W-B radiation over the Southern Ocean than the DNA of other Antarctic organisms.

There is increasing evidence that the occurrence and development of OA are modulated by the dietary intake of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA). This study investigated the effects of dietary PUFA, including n-3/n-6 PUFA proportion and the molecular form of n-3 PUFA, on OA using osteoporotic osteoarthritis dual model mice, where phospholipid type n-3 PUFA were specifically examined. The results revealed that a low proportion of n-6/n-3 PUFA in diets from 1 : 1 to 6 : 1 significantly improved the cartilage structure and inhibited articular cartilage polysaccharide loss. Furthermore, the low proportion n-6/n-3 PUFA diets inhibited the NF-kappa B signaling pathway by activating G-protein coupled receptor 120 (GPR120) to reduce inflammation and inhibit catabolism. Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) oil (AKO), rich in phospholipid-type n-3 PUFA, had a better effect on OA than linseed oil (plant-derived n-3 PUFA), which may be due to peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPAR gamma). These findings suggested that the low proportion n-6/n-3 PUFA diets, particularly with AKO, alleviated inflammation and inhibited articular cartilage degeneration. Therefore, dietary intervention can be a potential treatment for OA.

Krill was sampled from the same large ice flee composed of both 1- and 2-year ice as it drifted northward for a distance of c. 700 km. Abundance estimates for krill under this flee were in the range 0.1-6.25 ind m(-2). Krill aggregate in areas where rafting of ice floes and formation of new ice occur, or around a protected diving hole. The krill sampled consisted mainly of furcilia 6 and post-larvae which did not belong to the 0+ group originating in this (1991-92) year, but presumably hatched in the summer season of 1990-91 and developed very slowly so that at the end of the following summer season, larval stages were still present in the population. No increase of the mean krill size was observed during 2.5 months of observation. The role of larval advection for the maintenance of krill population in the Weddell Sea is discussed.																	0954-1020					DEC	1996	8	4					323	329		10.1017/S0954102096000491							WOS:A1996VY20500003						
J	Frazer, TK				Frazer, TK			Stable isotope composition (delta C-13 and delta N-15) of larval krill, Euphausia superba, and two of its potential food sources in winter	JOURNAL OF PLANKTON RESEARCH												Natural abundances of C-13 (delta(13)C) and N-15 (delta(15)N) were measured in larval krill (Euphausia superba), suspended particulate organic matter (POM) and ice associated POM during early and late winter along the west coast of the Antarctic Peninsula. Larval krill were enriched in C-13 (delta(13)C greater than or equal to 27 parts per thousand) relative to both larvae and adults sampled during summer months (delta(13)C generally less than or equal to 27 parts per thousand). Elevated delta(13)C values were also recorded in suspended POM (delta(13)C greater than or equal to 21 parts per thousand) during early winter. These data imply that (i) seasonal shifts in the isotopic composition of larval krill need not result from changes in diet and (ii) mechanisms other than CO2 limitation in the ice can account for C-13 enrichments in ice-associated POM. Stable carbon isotopes could not be used, in this study, to discern between suspended POM and ice-associated POM as alternative food sources for larval krill. During one early winter sampling period, larval krill were markedly depleted in N-15 (delta(15)N < 1 parts per thousand), suggesting that they are primarily herbivorous prior to exploiting ice-associated food resources. Mechanisms are proposed to explain variation in the isotopic composition of POM and larval krill, and will be of particular interest to those investigating food web dynamics and biogeochemical processes in the region.																	0142-7873					AUG	1996	18	8					1413	1426		10.1093/plankt/18.8.1413							WOS:A1996VE80800010

Antarctic Krill Are Reservoirs for Distinct Southern Ocean Microbial Communities	FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY												Host-associated bacterial communities have received limited attention in polar habitats, but are likely to represent distinct nutrient-rich niches compared to the surrounding environment. Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) are a super-abundant species with a circumpolar distribution, and the krill microbiome may make a substantial contribution to marine bacterial diversity in the Southern Ocean. We used high-throughput sequencing of the bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA gene to characterize bacterial diversity in seawater and krill tissue samples from four locations south of the Kerguelen Plateau, one of the most productive regions in the Indian Sector of the Southern Ocean. Krill-associated bacterial communities were distinct from those of the surrounding seawater, with different communities inhabiting the moults, digestive tract and faecal pellets, including several phyla not detected in the surrounding seawater. Digestive tissues from many individuals contained a potential gut symbiont (order: Mycoplasmoidales) shown to improve survival on a low quality diet in other crustaceans. Antarctic krill swarms thus influence Southern Ocean microbial communities not only through top-down grazing of eukaryotic cells and release of nutrients into the water column, but also by transporting distinct microbial assemblages horizontally via migration and vertically via sinking faecal pellets and moulted exuviae. Changes to Antarctic krill demographics or distribution through fishing pressure or climate-induced range shifts will also influence the composition and dispersal of Southern Ocean microbial communities.

The basal diet contained 51% of fish meal. Based on it, five isonitrogenous and isolipidic experimental diets were formulated with the protein replacement ratio of fish meal by krill meal as 0, 15%, 30%, 60% and 100%, respectively (DM0, DM15, DM30, DM60 and DM100, respectively). After an 8-week feeding trial, results showed that increasing levels of dietary krill meal linearly and quadratically increased significantly FBW, SGR and FI (P < 0.05). Significant positive linear trends were found between the increasing levels of dietary krill meal and carotenoid concentrations, redness (a*), yellowness (b*) and chroma (C*) in muscle; and significant negative trends were found in the lightness (L*) and hue (H*) responses (P < 0.05). The pH and liquid holding capacity (LHC) were not affected by dietary krill meal levels (P > 0.05). A positive quadratic trend was found between the dietary krill meal level and the springiness, and a negative linear trend in cohesiveness occurred (P < 0.05). The content of fluorine in vertebra increased linearly and quadratically significantly (P < 0.05) but the content of fluorine in muscle was not significantly affected by increasing levels of dietary krill meal (P > 0.05). The highest fluorine content in muscle was within the safe edible limit for humans. These results suggested that Antarctic krill meal could improve the growth performance and muscle pigmentation of triploid rainbow trout farmed in seawater.																	0044-8486	1873-5622				JUL 15	2019	509						72	84		10.1016/j.aquaculture.2019.05.013							WOS:000471749800011

Associated with these changes is a reported 38% and 81% per decade decline in the numerical density (hereafter density) of Antarctic krill Euphausia superba Dana, 1850, between 1976 and 2003. Few changes in other components of the ecosystem that could be attributed to such a change, such as a mass decline in krill-dependent predators, have been detected. In an ecosystem so dependent on this keystone species, a massive population decline in krill ought to have had an obvious effect. In the absence of such an effect, it is timely to revisit the issue of the purported decline in krill density. The original analysis that indicated a decline in krill density was based on the 2004 version of KRILLBASE, a database of net samples. We analysed the publicly available and updated version (version 1, accessed 30 November 2017) and our analyses did not suggest a significant decline in krill density. Rather, after accounting for sampling heterogeneity and habitat variables, average krill density appears to have been stable but with considerable inter-annual variability. Since our results were unable to find any evidence for a decline in krill density we recommend a re-appraisal of many of the paradigms that underlie much of the recent thinking about ecosystem change Antarctic waters. Such a revision is necessary to provide a firmer foundation for predictions of the effects of climate change and resource extraction on the Southern Ocean ecosystem.																	0278-0372	1937-240X				NOV	2018	38	6					656	661		10.1093/jcbiol/ruy072							WOS:000456691100002

Since natural materials generally pose a low risk to both the human health and the environment owing to their biodegradability, the wastewater released from their manufacturing processes is less polluting, and therefore, it requires less resources and energy for treatment compared to wastewater loaded with synthetic substances. Herein, we report the use of a protein by-product recovered from the oil extraction process of Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) to replace traditional mordanting agents in the dyeing of cotton with tannin-rich natural dye extracted from the bark of Xylocarpus granatum. Antarctic krill protein pretreatment successfully improved the dyeability of the fabrics through the formation of insoluble complexes between the protein and tannin. The color parameters of the dyed samples were measured based on the CIE L*a*b* system. The obtained reddish-brown fabrics exhibited mostly good to excellent color fastness ratings in response to washing and other wet treatments. They also displayed durable UV protection properties, with the UPF rating reaching the maximum (50+) level, despite being washed for 50 cycles. Both the Antarctic krill protein and tannin contributed to improved UV protection efficiency due to the presence of UV-absorbing moieties and slight changes in the resulting fabric thickness and cover factor.

The acoustic component of this survey was conducted using a scientific echosounder operating at 38 and 70 kHz to estimate the distribution and density of Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) and ice krill (E. crystallorophias). In addition, the relationship between the vertical distribution of Antarctic krill and the water temperature structure along the 140 degrees E meridian was investigated. Antarctic krill were distributed in the waters of the continental slope at 65-66 degrees S and the maximum value of the mean areal density rho in 1 nautical mile (nmi) intervals was 4344 inds. m(-2). Ice krill were distributed in the neritic waters of the continental shelf to the south of the 66 degrees S and the maximum rho in 1 nmi intervals was 23,669 inds. m(-2). Along the 140 degrees E meridian, Antarctic krill were mainly distributed at the water temperatures below 0.5 degrees C. Although they were mostly distributed shallower than approximately 100 m, dense aggregations at approximately 180-200 m were also observed, which coincided with a depression of the water temperature structure.

The krill DHA and EPA are generally considered to be similar to natural ones. However, two chemical compounds which were separated from Antarctic krill oil and identified as EPA and DHA by HRESIMS and NMR acted much more effective inhibitive activities on growth of several cell lines (U937, K562, SMMC-7721, PC-3, MDA-MB-231, HL60 and MCF-7) than those from sturgeon liver and commercial fish oil. Taking MCF-7 as an example, the IC50 values of Antarctic krill EPA and DHA were 14.01 and 19.94 mu M, while the IC50 values of sturgeon liver and commercial fish EPA and DHA were 81.45, 73.13, 82.11 and 75.31 mu M, respectively. Raman spectra revealed that the Antarctic krill EPA and DHA have E-configuration structures, which were different from those in commercial fish oil. Additionally, the Antarctic krill EPA and DHA had no effects on human normal liver cell line HL7702. These results indicated that the Antarctic krill E-EPA and E-DHA had a great prospect in cancer therapy.

Swarms of diversity at the gene cox1 in Antarctic krill	HEREDITY												The Antarctic krill, Euphausia superba, is an abundant and key species found in the Southern Ocean that forms dense, discrete swarms. Despite over three decades of research on Antarctic krill, the genetics of individual swarms is yet to be specifically investigated. In this study, we address the genetic diversity, population structure and demographic history of nine Antarctic krill swarms by sequencing 1173 bases of the gene cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (cox1, COI) from 504 individuals. Both haplotype diversity (h = 0.9974-1.0000) and nucleotide diversity (pi = 0.010275-0.011537) of Antarctic krill swarm samples was consistently high compared with populations of other species reported in the literature. Analysis of molecular variance did not show any significant genetic structure, thus implying that the sampled swarms do not appear to reflect discrete genetic units. Fu's Fs and Bayesian Skyride analyses provided strong evidence for a large increase in the population size of Antarctic krill, or selection favouring a particular mitochondrial lineage, within the last few 100 000 years (Pleistocene). The swarm-level results presented in this study not only further our understanding of Antarctic krill biology but, because of the economical importance of this species, also provide data to consider for future krill stock management.

Although ecosystem and management models typically assume that krill are passive drifters, their relatively large size and strong swimming ability suggest that the active movement of krill may play an important role in their spatial distribution. Thus, active swimming behavior by krill may influence spatial structure of food web interactions (e.g. feeding behavior of seabirds and marine mammals) and regional commercial fishery activity. The objective of this work was to model the potential for active movement to affect krill distribution, and consequently growth, reproductive success, and survival. We used state-dependent life history theory, implemented by stochastic dynamic programming, in combination with spatial information on food availability, current velocity, temperature, and predation risk, to predict krill swimming behavior near the northern Antarctic Peninsula. We found that including active krill behavior resulted in distribution patterns that are associated with increased survival, growth, and reproductive success compared to a model that treats krill as passive drifters. The expected reproductive success of actively behaving krill was about 70% greater than that of passively diffusing krill, suggesting that there are strong selective pressures for active behavior along oceanic drift trajectories. This modeling framework will benefit assessments of new catch limits as krill fishing grounds are partitioned into smaller spatial management units.																	0171-8630	1616-1599				JUN 8	2015	529						35	48		10.3354/meps11324							WOS:000356076000003

From sea ice to blubber: linking whale condition to krill abundance using historical whaling records	POLAR BIOLOGY												Krill (Euphausia superba) are fundamentally important in the Southern Ocean ecosystem, forming a critical food web link between primary producers and top predators. Krill abundance fluctuates with oceanographic conditions, most notably variation in winter sea ice, and is susceptible to environmental change. Although links between local krill availability and performance of land breeding, central place foragers are recognised, the effects of krill variability on baleen whales remain largely unclear because concurrent long-term data on whale condition and krill abundance do not exist. Here, we quantify links between whale body condition and krill abundance using a simple model that links krill abundance to sea ice extent. Body condition of humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) caught in west Australian waters between 1947 and 1963 was estimated from oil yields in whaling records. Annual estimates of krill abundance in the Southern Ocean where those whales foraged (70A degrees-130A degrees E) were correlated significantly with contemporary annual winter sea ice extent. We hindcast sea ice extent for the whaling period from reconstructed temperature data and found that whale body condition was significantly correlated with hindcasted winter sea ice extent, supporting the hypothesis that variations in body condition were likely mediated by associated krill fluctuations. As humpback whales migrate and breed on finite energy stores accrued during summer foraging in the Antarctic, changes in sea ice and concomitant changes in krill abundance have long-term implications for their condition and reproductive success.

Lipid content as a function of sex/maturity stage and season was used to calculate the energy density of krill ingested by chicks. Simulations tested the influence of variability in krill size-class distribution, sex-ratio, length-at-maturity, and the timing of spawning on krill population energy density and penguin chick fledging mass. Of the parameters included in simulations, variability in the timing of krill spawning had the greatest influence on predicted Adelie penguin fledging mass, with fledging mass decreasing from 3.30 to 2.92 kg when peak spawning was shifted from early December to early March. Adelie penguin chicks that fledge from colonies along the western Antarctic Peninsula (wAP) and survive to recruit into the breeding population are 0.117 kg heavier than those that do not survive to breed. Thus, it appears that small differences in fledging mass potentially have significant implications for Adelie penguin chick survivorship. Therefore, the timing of krill spawning may have important consequences for Adelie penguins, and other top-predator species, that may time critical activities to coincide with a period of dependable prey availability with maximum energy density.

However, the molecular mechanisms generating these rhythms remain far from understood. The aim of this study was to investigate seasonal differences in gene expression in three different latitudinal regions (South Georgia, South Orkneys/Bransfield Strait, Lazarev Sea) and to identify genes with potential regulatory roles in the seasonal life cycle of Antarctic krill. The RNA-seq data were analysed (a) for seasonal differences between summer and winter krill sampled from each region, and (b) for regional differences within each season. A large majority of genes showed an up-regulation in summer krill in all regions with respect to winter krill. However, seasonal differences in gene expression were less pronounced in Antarctic krill from South Georgia, most likely due to the milder seasonal conditions of the lower latitudes of this region, with a less extreme light regime and food availability between summer and winter. Our results suggest that in the South Orkneys/Bransfield Strait and Lazarev Sea region, Antarctic krill entered a state of metabolic depression and regressed development (winter quiescence) in winter. Moreover, seasonal gene expression signatures seem to be driven by a photoperiodic timing system that may adapt the flexible behaviour and physiology of Antarctic krill to the highly seasonal environment according to the latitudinal region. However, at the lower latitude South Georgia region, food availability might represent the main environmental cue influencing seasonal physiology.

Lipid and fatty acid digestibility in Calanus copepod and krill oil by Atlantic halibut (Hippoglossus hippoglossus L.)	AQUACULTURE												Marine zooplankton represent a significant biomass of marine lipid that could supply lipid in diets for farmed marine fish. Digestibility of lipid and fatty acids of the copepod, Calanus finmarchicus and Antarctic krill, Euphausia superba by farmed juvenile Atlantic halibut (Hippoglossus hippoglossus) was investigated. Halibut were fed diets containing one of the following test oils at 15% inclusion level: fish oil (FO), Calanus copepod oil (CO) and Euphausia krill oil (1(0). KO contained the highest level of saturates (SFA: 39%) and monounsaturates (MUFA; 38%), and was low in polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA; 24%) compared to CO (50%) and FO (43%). CO and FO contained lower levels of SFA (31% and 33%, respectively) and MUFA (19% and 24%, respectively). Lipid digestibility of the CO diet (81%) was significantly lower than that of KO (90%) and FO (93%) diets (P < 0.05), likely due to wax esters in CO. Digestibility of SFA in the CO diet (70%) was significantly lower than FO (75%) and KO (77%) and MUFA in CO (84%) was significantly lower than KO (93%) and FO (93%). Digestibility of PUFA was significantly higher in FO (97%) than CO (94%) and KO (95%). Generally the CO diet was significantly less digestible than FO and KO diets.

Behaviour affects local-scale distributions of Antarctic krill around South Georgia	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												Antarctic krill Euphausia superba are key to most Antarctic ecosystems, particularly at South Georgia, where penguins and seals rely on them for their breeding success each summer. Changes in krill behaviour and local-scale distribution during this time can have large consequences for these predators; however, we currently have little understanding of the behaviour of Antarctic krill in response to changing conditions of predation and food. We used a stochastic dynamic programming model to investigate the behaviour of krill within a region close to South Georgia that is known to be heavily foraged by penguins and seals. In the model, krill responded to changing conditions by adjusting their depth, density of swarm and swimming behaviour. We have shown the optimal behaviour of krill in 3 biologically distinct regions: the on-shelf region, shelf-break region and off-shelf region. We predict significantly higher concentrations of krill will result at the shelf-break region from krill choosing to swim slower and turn more often in a favourable zone. In addition, we predict a diel pattern in swarm density in most conditions of the model, with small krill generally forming lower density swarms than large krill, particularly on-shelf. This work is the first prediction of the effects of krill swarming and swimming behaviour on local-scale distribution.

The krill biomass in the area surveyed (872,500 km(2)) was estimated to be 4.83 million tonnes with a CV of 17%. Dense aggregations of krill, although encountered infrequently, dominated the biomass estimate. At least 97% of these aggregations were less than 200 m in transected length, and the largest was 1 100 m. Large clusters of aggregations ( > 1 km in transected length) were encountered on 4 of the 18 transects, and these dominated the krill biomass encountered during the survey. Krill were more abundant, with a broader latitudinal distribution, in the west of the survey area (80-115 degrees E) than in the east (115-150 degrees E). The absence of krill and the presence of warmer oceanic waters characterized the northeastern sector of the surveyed area. Krill aggregations were most frequently encountered in the shelf break region where the summer ice edge, 1000 m isobath, and the Antarctic Slope Front (ASF) (associated with the cooler coastal and warmer oceanic waters) coincided. The majority of krill aggregations were found in the top LOO m of the water column, and when deeper ( > 100 m) aggregations occurred they were usually coincident with aggregations in the top 100 m. The mean krill density for the area surveyed was 5.54 g m(-2) consistent with previous observations that the Indian Ocean sector is relatively impoverished when compared with krill density values for the South Atlantic. This density is at the low end of the range of values reported for surveys around South Georgia, Elephant Island, and the adjacent Prydz Bay region. However, this low average biomass results from averaging over a few krill-rich areas with large areas where krill is scarce or absent. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Aspects of krill growth and condition during late winter-early spring off East Antarctica (110-130 degrees E)	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY												Antarctic krill, Euphausia superba, is a keystone species in the Southern Ocean. However, information on growth, diet and condition during winter and early spring is limited, hampering our understanding of these fundamental biological parameters at this important period in their lifecycle. Our study assessed diet and condition of larval and postlarval krill collected from open water and below the ice off East Antarctica (110-130 degrees E) in September/October 2007. Condition was assessed using lipid content, growth rates and digestive gland size; feeding history was assessed using fatty acid profiles and stomach content analysis; and a 207-day starvation study investigated the response of krill to long-term food deprivation. Potential food items (Calanus propinquus and sea-ice biota) were analysed for lipid and fatty acid composition to compare with krill samples. Krill were found to be in good condition, with mean growth rate of 0.95% per moult for postlarvae and 14.79% for larvae, and mean lipid content of 24.1% for postlarvae and 6.6% for larvae. Fatty acid profiles and stomach content analysis revealed two main feeding strategies - krill below the ice were feeding mostly on sea-ice diatoms, while those in open water were ingesting copepods and detritus. Krill below the ice had larger digestive glands than those in open water. Furciliae fatty acid profiles indicated a diet of heterotrophic flagellates and/or detritus. Postlarval krill survived 207 days of food deprivation by using body protein and lipid reserves for energy. In contrast, krill furciliae were severely depleted after just 5 days of food deprivation, indicating that they must feed continually at this time of year. Krill, copepods and sea-ice biota were all low in polyunsaturated fatty acids, indicating that krill must rely on later spring phytoplankton blooms to obtain these essential nutrients required for reproduction.

Euphausiid community structure and population structure of Euphausia superba off Adelie Land in the Southern Ocean during austral summer 2003, 2005 and 2008	POLAR SCIENCE												The distribution and community structure of euphausiids and the population structure of Euphausia superba were investigated mainly along 140 degrees E off Adelie Land in the Indian Ocean sector of the Southern Ocean during the austral summers of 2003, 2005 and 2008. Euphausiids were collected from six discrete depth layers, primarily between 0 and 2000 m, using an RMT 8 net. Euphausia frigida and Euphausia triacantha mainly occurred north of the Southern Boundary of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (SB) whereas E. superba was distributed south of the SB, and occurred abundantly in the continental slope area where Antarctic Winter Water was observed. E. frigida and E. triacantha occurred in the upper 200 m during the night whereas they were mainly found below 200 m during the daytime. Cluster analysis on stations suggested that the SB is an important biological boundary for euphausiid communities. The population structure of E. superba in 2003 was different from that of 2005 and 2008. While large mature individuals dominated in 2003, small immature krill (juveniles and subadult males) were more abundant in 2005 and 2008. Further sea-ice extension in the preceding winter in 2005 and 2008 likely provided favourable conditions for spawning and survival. A cluster analysis based on similarity of the maturity stages of E. superba revealed that mature males and gravid females (stage IIIC-E) were mainly distributed in the offshore area and mesopelagic zone, while juveniles and subadult males were found in the epipelagic zone of the continental slope area. Therefore, it is considered that E. superba migrates to the offshore area and mesopelagic zone as it grows. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. and NIPR. All rights reserved.

They allowing primary production and providing new seabed for colonisation, both acting as a negative feedback of climate change. However, the injection of sediment-laden runoff from the melting of land-terminating glaciers may reduce this feedback. Changes in particulate matter will affect nutrition and excretion (faeces stoichiometry and properties) of suspension feeders, reshaping coastal carbon dynamics and pelagic-benthic coupling. Absorption efficiency and biodeposition of Euphausia superba and Cnemidocarpa verrucosa were quantified for different food treatments and varying sediment concentrations. Both species showed high overall absorption efficiency for free-sediment diets, but were negatively affected by sediment addition. High sediment conditions increased krill biodeposition, while it decreased in ascidians. Energy balance estimation indicated high carbon sink potential in ascidians, but it is modulated by food characteristics and negatively affected by sediment inputs in the water column.

The percentage of males in size classes of adult krill was generally high in krill of 30 to 35 mm total length, always low in 38 to 42 mm. krill, sometimes showed higher values in 45 to 50 rum krill, but always decreased in the largest krill (> 50 mm). This pattern was reproduced by a model simulation that assumed faster growth and a shorter lifespan for males when compared to females. These results suggest that the numbers of males should decline with time unless new recruits enter the population. Indeed, interannual variations in PM from the field (net collected data and penguin diet data) showed a decline in the proportion of males when several years of low recruitment followed a recruitment pulse. These results lead us to conclude that male krill grow faster and have a shorter lifespan than females in the natural environment.

In coastal waters, ammonium supply by mesozooplankton indicated a low contribution to fuel primary production. In oceanic waters, however, Antarctic krill Euphausia superba contributed a significant percentage to the nitrogen requirements of primary producers. Thus, the ontogenetic migration of adult krill during austral summer should be a key factor regulating the regenerated ammonium for primary production. A significant coupling of ammonium concentration in the water column and in situ krill biomass supported the significant role of krill excretion in the epipelagic realm. Results from short-term experiments with E. superba indicated that ammonium excretion rates were much higher than previously found. Because the use of experimental metabolic rates that are close to field rates would be more appropriate, we suggest to re-assess the ammonium supplied by the epipelagic marine biota. Moreover, the outcomes of experimental krill excretion rates, in situ measurements of ammonium and a review of data on primary production suggest that Antarctic krill sustain a high proportion of the daily phytoplankton production.

LFK was prepared by removing exoskeletons from dried whole krill to give a fluoride content of approximately one-fourth of krill meal (KM) at 230 ppm for LFK and 870 ppm for KM. Experimental diets replaced FM with LFK at the replacement proportions of 0.0%, 7.7%, 15.4%, 30.8%, 46.2% and 100.0% (control, LFK7, LFK15, LFK30, LFK46 and LFK100) and were fed to groups of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) in duplicate for 95 days in fresh water and growth was observed. In all experimental groups, feed intake, feed efficiency, specific growth rate and hepatosomatic index were unchanged compared with fish fed the control diet (P<0.05). After 95 days, the fluoride concentration in dorsal muscles of the fish of each experimental group, except LFK100, was below the detectable limit (1 mg/kg), and in vertebral bones it was between 220 mg/kg and 420 mg/kg. However, the dorsal muscle and the vertebral bone of LFK100 contained 1 mg/kg and 1800 mg/kg of fluoride, respectively. Tissue specimens of the liver of each experimental group at 95 days had no histopathological changes.

Four diets containing 0% (S0 group), 10% (S10 group), 20% (S20 group), and 30% (S20 group) FDPE were used in the present study. At the end of growth trial, the final body weight, weight gain rate, and specific growth rate in the S10, S20, and S30 groups were higher than those in the S0 group. The shrimp in the S10 and S20 groups exhibited better molting synchronism than those in the S0 group. The astaxanthin content in the hepatopancreas from the shrimp in the groups supplemented with FDPE was significantly higher than that in the S0 group (p < 0.05) and increased as the FDPE content in the feed increased. The shrimp in the S10, S20, and S30 groups had a higher monounsaturated fatty acid (MUFA) content in the hepatopancreas than those in the S0 group. The sum of EPA and DHA in the muscles from the shrimp in the S0 group was lower than that in the other groups. These results indicate that the dietary inclusion of 10%-20% FDPE can be used as practical diets in L. vannamei farmed under a clear water system.

We hypothesized that sea ice provides additional benefits because it hosts fewer competitors and provides reduced predation risk for krill larvae than the water column. To test our hypothesis, zooplankton were sampled in the Weddell-Scotia Confluence Zone at the ice-water interface (0-2 m) and in the water column (0-500 m) during August-October 2013. Grazing by mesozooplankton, expressed as a percentage of the phytoplankton standing stock, was higher in the water column (1.97 +/- 1.84%) than at the ice-water interface (0.08 +/- 0.09%), due to a high abundance of pelagic copepods. Predation risk by carnivorous macrozooplankton, expressed as a percentage of the mesozooplankton standing stock, was significantly lower at the ice-water interface (0.83 +/- 0.57%; main predators amphipods, siphonophores and ctenophores) than in the water column (4.72 +/- 5.85%; main predators chaetognaths and medusae). These results emphasize the important role of sea ice as a suitable winter habitat for larval krill with fewer competitors and lower predation risk. These benefits should be taken into account when considering the response of Antarctic krill to projected declines in sea ice. Whether reduced sea-ice algal production may be compensated for by increased water column production remains unclear, but the shelter provided by sea ice would be significantly reduced or disappear, thus increasing the predation risk on krill larvae.

Although the adaptive significance of this seasonal metabolic shift seems obvious, the driving factors are still unclear. In particular, it is debated whether the seasonal metabolic cycle is driven by changes in food availability, or if an endogenous timing system entrained by photoperiod might be involved. In this study, we used different long-term photoperiodic simulations to examine the influence of light regime and endogenous rhythmicity on the regulation of krill seasonal metabolic cycle. Krill showed a seasonal cycle of growth characterized by null-to-negative growth rates during autumn-winter and positive growth rates during spring-summer, which was manifested also in constant darkness, indicating strong endogenous regulation. Similar endogenous cycles were observed for the activity of the key-metabolic enzyme malate dehydrogenase (MDH) and for the expression levels of a selection of metabolic-related genes, with higher values in spring-summer and lower values in autumn-winter. On the other side, a seasonal cycle of oxygen consumption was observed only when krill were exposed to simulated seasonal changes in photoperiod, indicating that light-related cues might play a major role in the regulation of krill oxygen consumption. The influence of light-regime on oxygen consumption was minimal during winter, when light-phase duration was below 8 h, and it was maximal during summer, when light-phase duration was above 16 h. Significant upregulation of the krill clock genes clk, cry2, and tim1, as well as of the circadian-related opsins rh1a and rrh, was observed after light-phase duration had started to decrease in early autumn, suggesting the presence of a signaling cascade linking specific seasonal changes in the Antarctic light regime with clock gene activity and the regulation of krill metabolic dormancy over the winter.

J	VIRTUE, P; NICOL, S; NICHOLS, PD				VIRTUE, P; NICOL, S; NICHOLS, PD			CHANGES IN THE DIGESTIVE GLAND OF EUPHAUSIA-SUPERBA DURING SHORT-TERM STARVATION - LIPID CLASS, FATTY-ACID AND STEROL CONTENT AND COMPOSITION	MARINE BIOLOGY												During a period of short-term (19 d) starvation, total lipid in the digestive gland of Euphausia superba Dana decreased from 21 to 9% dry weight. Total lipid per digestive gland decreased significantly during starvation compared to Day 0 individuals, falling from 1960 (+/-172) to 385 (+/-81) mu g. Polar lipid was the major lipid class utilised during starvation, falling from 1510 (+/-225) to 177 (+/-46) mu g per digestive gland (76 to 45%). Absolute levels of triacylglycerol fell from 300 (+/-41) to 76 (+/-5) mu g; however, relative levels remained unchanged. The relative level of free fatty acid increased significantly with starvation (4 to 39%) with absolute levels ranging from 79 (+/-1) to 156 (+/-20) mu g per digestive gland. Absolute levels of all fatty acids per digestive gland declined continually until the end of the starvation period. The long-chain polyunsaturated acids eicosapentaenoic (20:5 omega 3) and docosahexaenoic (22:6 omega 3), decreased with starvation from 37 to 26% and 15 to 10%, respectively whereas the saturated fatty acid, palmitic acid (16:0), increased from 15 to 22%. Cholesterol, the major sterol in this organ, increased from 17 (+/-20) to 44 (+/-13) mu g per digestive gland by Day 3, and by Day 19 had returned to levels found in the digestive gland of Day 0 individuals. Desmosterol followed a similar pattern to cholesterol, increasing from 3 (+/-1) mu g per digestive gland on Day 0 to 11 (+/-4) mu g on Day 3, and falling to 2 (+/-1) mu g on Day 19. Other sterols in the digestive gland, predominantly of algal origin, fell from the levels found in Day 0 individuals to near zero amounts by Day 6. The digestive gland of E. superba plays a dynamic role during shortterm starvation in terms of lipid content and composition. The relative levels of polar lipids, free fatty acids and cholesterol in the digestive gland may provide reliable indices of the nutritional condition of E. superba in the field. Sterols in the digestive gland are indicative of recent dietary composition of krill, and may also be used to quantify dietary input from individual phytoplanktonic species.

J	Phleger, CF; Nelson, MM; Mooney, BD; Nichols, PD				Phleger, CF; Nelson, MM; Mooney, BD; Nichols, PD			Interannual and between species comparison of the lipids, fatty acids and sterols of Antarctic krill from the US AMLR Elephant Island survey area	COMPARATIVE BIOCHEMISTRY AND PHYSIOLOGY B-BIOCHEMISTRY & MOLECULAR BIOLOGY												Antarctic euphausiids, Euphausia superba, E. tricantha, E. frigida and Thysanoessa macrura were collected near Elephant I Island 1 during 1997 and 1998. Total lipid was highest in E. superba small juveniles (16 mg g(-1) wet mass), ranging from 12 to 15 mg in other euphausiids. Polar lipid (56-81% of total lipid) and triacylglycerol (12-38%) were the major lipids with wax esters (6%) only present in E. tricantha. Cholesterol was the major sterol (80-100% of total sterols) with desmosterol second in abundance (1-18%). 1997 T macrura and E. superba contained a more diverse sterol profile, including 24-nordehydrocholesterol (0.1-1.7%), trans-dehydrocholesterol (1.1-1.5%), brassicasterol (0.5-1.7%). 24-methylenecholesterol (0.1-0.4%) and two stanols (0.1-0.2%). Monounsaturated fatty acids included primarily 18:1(n-9)c (7-21%), 18:1(n-7)c (3-13%) and 16:1(n-7)c (2-7%). The main saturated fatty acids in krill were 16:0 (18-29%), 14:0 (2-15%) and 18:0 (1-13%). Highest eicosapentaenoic acid [EPA, 20:5 (n-3)] and docosahexaenoic acid [DHA, 22:6(n-3)] occurred in E. superba (EPA, 15-21%; DHA, 9-14%), and were less abundant in other krill. E. superba is a good source of EPA and DHA for consideration of direct or indirect use as a food item for human consumption. Lower levels of 18:4(n-3) in E. tricantha, E. frigida and T macrura (0.4-0.7% of total fatty acids) are more consistent with a carnivorous or omnivorous diet as compared with herbivorous E. superba (3.7-9.4%). The polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) 18:5(n-3) and the very-long chain (VLC-PUFA), C-26 and C-28 PUFA, were not present in 1997 samples, but were detected at low levels in most 1998 euphausiids. Interannual differences in these biomarkers suggest greater importance of dinoflagellates or some other phytoplankton group in the Elephant Island area during 1998. The data have enabled between year comparisons of trophodynamic interactions of krill collected in the Elephant Island region, and will be of use to groups using signature lipid methodology.

The use of fishing vessels to provide acoustic data on the distribution and abundance of Antarctic krill and other pelagic species	FISHERIES RESEARCH												A fishery for Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) has existed for over 3 decades and the Commission for Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR) manages this fishery using precautionary catch limits, fishery data collection and a scientific observer programme operating on the fishing vessels. A recent increase in the number of vessels fishing and the rising costs of undertaking scientific research cruises have focussed attention on being able to use fishing vessels to collect more extensive scientific data sets. In 2011, CCAMLR's Subgroup on Acoustic Survey and Analysis Methods (SG-ASAM) was tasked with assessing the use of acoustic data collected from fishing vessels to provide qualitative and quantitative information on the distribution and relative abundance of Antarctic krill and other pelagic species. SG-ASAM conceived a proof of concept programme and implemented the first stage in 2013 to determine the current setup of acoustic equipment on participating fishing vessels and to establish whether these vessels could collect geo- and time-referenced acoustic data. To date data have been received from 7 krill fishing vessels and SG-ASAM has now focussed on the development of data collection protocols to enable fishing vessels to collect quantitative acoustic data along prescribed transects. While this development work continues, the willingness of fishing industry to participate in such studies has already been demonstrated by several fishing companies, and Norwegian- and Chinese-flagged fishing vessels are undertaking krill biomass surveys in two key fishery Areas in the South Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean.

Extraction and characterisation of lipids from Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba)	FOOD CHEMISTRY												There is significant commercial interest in oil extraction from krill because it is rich in omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFA) such as eicosapentaenoic (EPA, 20:5n3) and docosahexaenoic (DHA, 22:6n3) acids. The objectives were to determine oil extraction efficiency using different solvent systems and the composition of extracted oil and spent krill following extraction. Extraction efficiency was the highest (P < 0.05) for one-step extraction using freeze-dried krill with 1:12 or 1:30 krill:solvent ratio (w:v) compared to Folch, Soxhlet, and conventional two-step extraction. Extracted oils contained predominantly phospholipids (20-33%), polar non-phospholipids (64-77%), and minor triglycerides (1-3%). Triglycerides contained much less (P < 0.05) total n-3 (4.0%), DHA (1.1%), and EPA (2.3%), but more < 0.05) saturated FA (38.7%) than phospholipids (total n-3-47.4%, DHA-18.0%, EPA-28.2%, saturated FA-23.5%). Antioxidant capacity of krill oil extracted by one-step extraction (9.4-14.2 mu mol Trolox Equivalents/ml oil) was generally similar to antioxidant capacity of krill oil extracted by ethanol (22.9), but greater (P < 0.05) than antioxidant capacity of krill oil extracted by acetone (1.2) and Folch method (1.5). The spent krill following oil extraction contained protein (72.9-75.8%, dry basis). Based on the extraction efficiency and composition of the extracted oil, the one-step extraction using 1:12 krill:solvent ratio is recommended. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Diet of a specialist in a changing environment: the crabeater seal along the western Antarctic Peninsula	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												Although crabeater seals Lobodon carcinophaga are among the most abundant consumers of Antarctic krill Euphausia superba, their diet has rarely been studied throughout most of the species' range. Using delta C-13 and delta N-15 values in vibrissae from 53 seals, we examined the trophic ecology of crabeater seals from the western Antarctic Peninsula (wAP) in 2001, 2002 and 2007. We observed a wide variability in individual seal mean delta C-13 values, which ranged from -19.8 parts per thousand to -24.9 parts per thousand, whereas mean delta N-15 value varied from 5.4 parts per thousand to 7.9 parts per thousand. We identified a positive significant effect of seal mass on delta C-13 values, as well as a significant seasonal effect (higher delta C-13 values in austral winter), which likely resulted from changes in the composition of the community of primary producers. delta N-15 values for crabeater seals, on the other hand, were affected by year, with individuals in 2002 having higher delta N-15 values. The median (with range) contribution of Antarctic krill to the diet of crabeater seals, as estimated using the Bayesian mixing model MixSIR, was 87.9% (81.2 to 94.8%). During 2002, krill biomass in the wAP was at one of its lowest levels during the last 2 decades, coinciding with a slight reduction in the importance of krill for the diet of the seals that year, which reached 84.5% (75.1 to 92.4%). Despite the relative plasticity observed in the diet of crabeater seals, it is unknown to what extent, and at what rate, crabeater seals might be able to switch to a more generalized diet, which might impact their fitness, given the ongoing environmental change along the wAP.

Variability in tissue-specific trophic discrimination factors ( increment C-13 and increment N-15) between Antarctic krill Euphausia superba and free-ranging Pygoscelis penguins	POLAR BIOLOGY												For top consumers in marine environments, trophic discrimination factors ( increment C-13 and increment N-15) between food and consumers' tissues are expected to be similar among related species. However, few studies conducted in the laboratory indicate a large variability among species, which should be potentially higher in free-ranging animals. Here, we test for differences in tissue-specific increment C-13 and increment N-15 values of two wild penguin species (Chinstrap Pygoscelis antarctica and Gentoo P. papua) breeding in sympatry at Livingston Island, Antarctica. A total of 41 adults and 28 chicks, and food items comprised exclusively by Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba, n = 22) in Chinstraps and almost exclusively in Gentoos, were sampled for stable isotope analyses. Overall, Delta C-13 values varied between -1.8 and 4.0 parts per thousand and Delta N-15 values ranged from 1.2 to 6.1 parts per thousand, and these differed between species, tissues and age-classes. Delta C-13 in adult penguins differed between species for feather and blood. Species-specific differences in Delta C-13 and Delta N-15 were seen in chick nail and muscle, while only Delta C-13 values differed between species in feathers. Our results show that trophic discrimination factors can differ substantially between closely related species consuming similar prey, especially in Delta C-13 value. Variation in Delta C-13 was driven by species, tissue and age-class, while variation in Delta N-15 was mostly driven by tissue type. Trophic discrimination factors may be associated to physiological and/or stress factors which may fluctuate in the wild, and this was particularly evident on chicks. This study highlights the use of diet-specialised species for the determination of trophic discrimination factors in the wild.

C.; Bracher, Astrid; Schroeder, Michael; Gutt, Julian			Horizontal niche partitioning of humpback and fin whales around the West Antarctic Peninsula: evidence from a concurrent whale and krill survey	POLAR BIOLOGY												A dedicated aerial cetacean survey was conducted concurrently to a standardised net trawl survey for krill in order to investigate distribution patterns of large whales and different krill species and to investigate relationships of these. Distance sampling data were used to produce density surface models for humpback (Megaptera novaeangliae) and fin whales (Balaenoptera physalus) around the West Antarctic Peninsula (WAP). Abundance for both species was estimated over two strata in the Bransfield Strait and Drake Passage. Distinct distribution patterns suggest horizontal niche partitioning of the two whale species around the WAP, with fin whales aggregating at the shelf edge of the South Shetland Islands in the Drake Passage and humpback whales in the Bransfield Strait. Krill biomass estimated from the concurrent krill survey was used along with CTD data from the same expedition, bathymetric parameters and satellite data on chlorophyll-a and ice concentration to model krill distribution. Comparisons of the predicted distributions of both whale species with the predicted distributions of Euphausia superba, Euphausia crystallorophias and Thysanoessa macrura suggest a complex relationship rather than a straightforward correlation between krill and whales. However, results indicate that fin whales were feeding in an area dominated by T. macrura, while humpback whales were found in areas of higher E. superba biomass. Our results provide abundance estimates for humpback whales and, for the first time, fin whales in the WAP and contribute important information on feeding ecology and habitat use of these two species in the Southern Ocean.

LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY-METHODS												A calibrated 120 kHz single-beam echo-sounder was integrated into an ocean glider and deployed in the Weddell Sea, Southern Ocean. The glider was deployed for two short periods in January 2012, in separate survey boxes on the continental shelf to the east of the Antarctic Peninsula, to assess the distribution of Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba). During the glider missions, a research vessel undertook acoustic transects using a calibrated, hull-mounted, multi-frequency echo-sounder. Net hauls were taken to validate acoustic targets and parameterize acoustic models. Krill targets were identified using a thresholded schools analysis technique (SHAPES), and acoustic data were converted to krill density using the stochastic distorted-wave Born approximation (SDWBA) target strength model. A sensitivity analysis of glider pitch and roll indicated that, if not taken into account, glider orientation can impact density estimates by up to 8-fold. Glider-based, echo-sounder-derived krill density profiles for the two survey boxes showed features coherent with ship-borne measurements, with peak densities in both boxes around a depth of 60 m. Monte Carlo simulation of glider subsampling of ship-borne data showed no significant difference from observed profiles. Simulated glider dives required at least an order of magnitude more time than the ship to similarly estimate the abundance of krill within the sample regions. These analyses highlight the need for suitable sampling strategies for glider-based observations and are our first steps toward using autonomous underwater vehicles for ecosystem assessment and long-term monitoring. With appropriate survey design, gliders can be used for estimating krill distribution and abundance.

Glider-Based Estimates of Meso-Zooplankton Biomass Density: A Fisheries Case Study on Antarctic Krill (Euphausia superba) Around the Northern Antarctic Peninsula	FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE												We compare estimates of krill density derived from gliders to those from contemporaneous and previous ship-based surveys. Our comparisons cover several temporal and spatial scales within two strata around the northern Antarctic Peninsula (off Cape Shirreff on the north side of Livingston Island and in the Bransfield Strait). Our objective is to explore the feasibility of using gliders to supplement or replace vessel-based surveys of fishery resources. We deployed two long-duration Slocum G3 gliders manufactured by Teledyne Webb Research (TWR), each equipped with a suite of oceanographic sensors and a three-frequency (38, 67.5, and 125 kHz, each single-beam) Acoustic Zooplankton Fish Profiler. We used the acoustic data collected by these gliders to estimate biomass densities (g.m(-2)) of Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba). The two gliders were, respectively, deployed for 82 and 88 days from mid-December 2018 through mid-March 2019. Off Cape Shirreff, glider-based densities estimated from two repeat small-scale surveys during mid-December and January were 110.6 and 55.7 g.m(-2), respectively. In Bransfield Strait, the glider-based estimate of biomass density was 106.7 g.m(-2) during December-January. Contemporaneous ship-based estimates of biomass density, from a multi-ship broad-scale krill survey (Macaulay et al., 2019) restricted to the areas sampled by the gliders, were 84.6 g.m(-2) off Cape Shirreff and 79.7 g.m(-2) in Bransfield Strait during January. We compared two alternative krill-delineation algorithms (dB differencing and SHAPES); differences between biomass densities estimated by applying these algorithms were small and ranged between 4 and 7%. Alternative methods of sampling krill length-frequency distributions (LFDs) (nets or predator diets), which are required to convert acoustic energy to biomass density, also influenced the glider-based results. In Bransfield Strait, net-based estimates of biomass density were 6% less than those based on predator diets. Off Cape Shirreff the biomass density of krill estimated from a net-based LFD was 20% greater than that based on predator diets. Development of a variance estimator for glider-based biomass surveys is ongoing, but our results demonstrate that fisheries surveys using acoustically-equipped gliders are feasible, can provide density estimates to inform management, and may be conducted at lower cost than ship surveys in some cases.																		2296-7745				MAR 25	2021	8								604043	10.3389/fmars.2021.604043							WOS:000637885500001

E.; Statscewich, Hank; Steinberg, Deborah K.; Winsor, Peter			Factors that affect the nearshore aggregations of Antarctic krill in a biological hotspot	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART I-OCEANOGRAPHIC RESEARCH PAPERS												Antarctic krill, Euphausia superba, is a highly abundant and ecologically important zooplankton species in the Southern Ocean. Regions of elevated Antarctic krill biomass exist around Antarctica, often as a result of the concentrating effect of bathyrnetry and ocean currents. Such areas are considered biological hotspots and are key foraging grounds for numerous top predators in the region. A hotspot of Antarctic krill biomass exists off the southern extent of Anvers Island, Western Antarctic Peninsula, and supports a population of Adelie penguins that feed almost exclusively on it, as well as numerous other top predators. We investigated the spatio-temporal variability in Antarctic krill biomass and aggregation structure over four consecutive summer seasons, identifying environmental factors that were responsible. We identified three distinct krill aggregation types (Large dense, Small-close and Small-sparse), and found that the relative proportion of each type to total aggregation numbers varied significantly between survey days. Large-dense aggregations occurred more frequently when westerly winds predominated and when the local mixed tide was in the diurnal regime. Small-close aggregations were also more frequent during diurnal tides and were negatively correlated with phytoplankton biomass. Small sparse aggregations, on the other hand, were more prevalent when the mixed tide was in the semi-diurnal phase. We suggest that, under certain conditions (i.e. diurnal tides and westerly winds), the biological hotspot in the nearshore waters off Palmer Station, Anvers Island, functions as a zone of accumulation, concentrating krill biomass. Our findings provide important information on the dynamics of Antarctic krill at the local scale.				schofield, oscar/H-4169-2018	schofield, oscar/0000-0003-2359-4131												0967-0637	1879-0119				AUG	2017	126						139	147		10.1016/j.dsr.2017.05.008							WOS:000408076600012

A quantified Bayesian Maximum Entropy estimate of Antarctic krill abundance across the Scotia Sea and in small-scale management units from the CCAMLR-2000 survey	CCAMLR SCIENCE												A probabilistic Bayesian Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) technique was used to estimate the abundance of Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) across the Scotia Sea using data from the CCAMLR 2000 Krill Synoptic Survey of Area 48 (CCAMLR-2000 Survey) and to map the density distribution of krill across the survey area. Density values for the unsurveyed off-transect portions of the survey area were inferred, and thus values for total biomass across the survey area, and within individual small-scale management units (SSMUs), were estimated. Abundance in some of the individual SSMUs had not previously been estimated due to the sparseness of data in these regions. The MaxEnt formalism allows an objective choice of the parameters of the estimation method, and hence an objective choice of the most probable reconstruction of krill distribution, given the data. The Bayesian framework also allows intrinsic calculation of the error in the density estimates. The total biomass inferred for the survey area was 208 million tonnes, with a standard deviation of 10 million tonnes. The MaxEnt method provides new insights into the extremely sparse survey data (only 0.6% of the survey area was directly acoustically sampled), and enhances the conservation and management potential of the CCAMLR-2000 Survey.

We quantified albatross foraging behaviour both from ships using binoculars and from land using satellite-tracked transmitters. Black-browed Albatrosses changed their movement behaviour in the vicinity of krill swarms whereas Grey-headed Albatrosses did not. We compared the patterns of population dispersal of both species around South Georgia in three years of very different krill abundance. In 1994, a year of exceptional krill scarcity, Black-browed but not Grey-headed, Albatrosses dispersed much farther offshore than during either 1986 or 1993, years of plentiful krill. The tendency for Black-browed Albatrosses to disperse farther offshore when krill was scarce was confirmed both by satellite tracking and by offshore surveys of population distribution.																	0373-2266						1997	85	1					129	134									WOS:A1997XZ41200012

The key species Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) has evolved metabolic and behavioural seasonal rhythms to cope with these seasonal changes. We investigate the switch between a physiological less active and active period for adult krill, a rhythm which seems to be controlled by internal biological clocks. These biological clocks can be synchronized by environmental triggers such as day length and food availability. They have evolved for particular environmental regimes to synchronize predictable seasonal environmental changes with important life cycle functions of the species. In a changing environment the time when krill is metabolically active and the time of peak food availability may not overlap if krill's seasonal activity is solely determined by photoperiod (day length). This is especially true for the Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean where the spatio-temporal ice cover dynamics are changing substantially with rising average temperatures. We developed an individual-based model for krill to explore the impact of photoperiod and food availability on the growth and demographics of krill. We simulated dynamics of local krill populations (with no movement of krill assumed) along a south-north gradient for different triggers of metabolic activity and different levels of food availability below the ice. We also observed the fate of larval krill which cannot switch to low metabolism and therefore are likely to overwinter under ice. Krill could only occupy the southern end of the gradient, where algae bloom only lasts for a short time, when alternative food supply under the ice was high and metabolic activity was triggered by photoperiod. The northern distribution was limited by lack of overwintering habitat for krill larvae due to short duration of sea ice cover even for high food content under the ice. The variability of the krill's length-frequency distributions varied for different triggers of metabolic activity, but did not depend on the sea ice extent. Our findings suggest a southward shift of krill populations due to reduction in the spatial sea ice extent, which is consistent with field observations. Overall, our results highlight the importance of the explicit consideration of spatio-temporal sea ice dynamics especially for larval krill together with temporal synchronization through internal clocks, triggered by environmental factors (photoperiod and food) in adult krill for the population modelling of krill.

J	Meyer, B				Meyer, Bettina			The overwintering of Antarctic krill, Euphausia superba, from an ecophysiological perspective	POLAR BIOLOGY												A major aim of this review is to determine which physiological functions are adopted by adults and larvae to survive the winter season with low food supply and their relative importance. A second aim is to clarify the extent to which seasonal variation in larval and adult krill physiology is mediated by environmental factors with a strong seasonality, such as food supply or day light. Experimental studies on adult krill have demonstrated that specific physiological adaptations during autumn and winter, such as reduced metabolic rates and feeding activity, are not caused simply by the scarcity of food, as was previously assumed. These adaptations appear to be influenced by the local light regime. The physiological functions that larval krill adopt during winter (reduced metabolism, delayed development, lipid utilisation, and variable growth rates) are, in contrast to the adults, under direct control by the available food supply. During winter, the adults often seem to have little association with sea ice (at least until early spring). The larvae, however, feed within sea ice but mainly on the grazers of the ice algal community rather than on the algae themselves. In this respect, a miss-match in timing of the occurrence of the last phytoplankton blooms in autumn and the start of the sea ice formation, as has been increasingly observed in the west Antarctic Peninsula (WAP) region, will impact larval krill development during winter in terms of food supply and consequently the krill stock in this region.

J	BRINTON, E				BRINTON, E			DISTRIBUTION AND POPULATION STRUCTURES OF IMMATURE AND ADULT EUPHAUSIA-SUPERBA IN THE WESTERN BRANSFIELD STRAIT REGION DURING THE 1986-87 SUMMER	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART A-OCEANOGRAPHIC RESEARCH PAPERS												Interrelationships among body size, maturity state and spatial distribution in immature and adult Euphausia superba were examined through the course of the 1986-87 reproductive season in a region centered in western Bransfield Strait and extending northward into Drake Passage and southward into Gerlache Strait. During an initial (December to January) peak in production of phytoplankton and krill larvae in Gerlache Strait and adjacent parts of Bransfield Strait, so few post-larvae and adults were caught that the parent stock of those larvae could not be identified with certainty. However, small adults of 36-42 mm body length were caught in abundance later in the summer (February to March), after larval recruitment in and near Gerlache Strait had ceased. Many of these small adults then appeared to be post-reproductive. In Bransfield Strait during late summer (late February to March) there was a nearly equal mixture of small adults (which dominated in Gerlache Strait) and large adults (> 42 mm); the large adults showed most evidence of recent reproductive activity and could have been responsible for much of the late summer larval recruitment in Bransfield Strait. In Drake Passage, large adults were usually dominant; the few caught in December were undergoing maturation near the South Shetlands, and in January they were reproductive and dispersed in more offshore oceanic waters. During late February to March, krill became more available in Drake Passage with many having reassembled in aggregations near Livingston Island (South Shetlands). By then, not only small adults but also large adults appeared post-reproductive in all areas. Evidence relating to growth rate in adults was obscured by erratic variations in ratios of body-length classes, month-to-month, considered artifacts on sampling. However, adult growth appeared negligible during January to March. After midsummer (January) there were distinct changes in relative abundances of males to females of > 42 mm: within 43-47 mm the modal frequencies favored females, and within 48-55 mm males were dominant, suggesting differential survivorship. The Gerlache-Bransfield Straits and similar coastal habitats must be considered nursery areas, not only for immature krill as has been previously proposed, but also for early summer larvae. In particularly productive years, as in 1986-87, these coastal waters may become spawning localities for small adult krill before reproduction by large adults develops farther away from the Peninsula. Immatures of < 12 mm in December and ca 16-30 mm by March, comprised a subgroup of the smallest immature krill though not consistently abundant enough to be distinguished as a year class. Their distributions suggest origins and early growth outside of the study area, possibly in the Weddell Sea and coastal waters of the Bellingshausen Sea.																	0198-0149					AUG-SEP	1991	38	8-9					1169	1193		10.1016/0198-0149(91)90101-K							WOS:A1991GH34600013						
J	Siegel, V				Siegel, Volker			Krill stocks in high latitudes of the Antarctic Lazarev Sea: seasonal and interannual variation in distribution, abundance and demography	POLAR BIOLOGY												The motivation of the LAKRIS project (Lazarev Krill Study) was to investigate the seasonal and interannual variability in distribution, demography, phenology and population dynamics of Antarctic krill Euphausia superba in poorly studied high-latitude areas. The core data set consists of four RMT-net-sampling surveys that were conducted in early summer (December 2005 and 2007), autumn (April 2004) and winter (July to August 2006). Supplementary data were analysed from the 1980s to view the results in a wider geographical context. The major observations are the following: (1) krill abundance and distribution showed geographical, seasonal and interannual fluctuations. Krill abundance was almost one order of magnitude lower compared to the Southwest Atlantic. (2) Krill density showed substantial differences between day and night for autumn and winter surveys. (3) A spatial gradient was observed for krill size groups, with larger sized (adult spawning) krill further south and medium-sized juveniles and immatures mainly between 60A degrees and 67A degrees S. (4) Data on maturity stage composition and larvae occurrence indicate an active and successful spawning in these high-latitude areas even under the conditions of sea-ice cover. At the end of the spawning season, females and males regressed in their external sexual characteristics ('re-juvenation') to overwintering immature stages. Major conclusions relate to a conceptual view of the spatial distribution of krill size classes and the occurrence of larvae in the context of major oceanographic features and current systems in the Lazarev Sea and adjacent ocean sectors. The Lazarev Sea obviously does not support a single self-maintaining population, but represents a complex transition zone of stocks with different origins from the Scotia Sea and the Cosmonaut Sea.																	0722-4060	1432-2056				AUG	2012	35	8					1151	1177		10.1007/s00300-012-1162-y							WOS:000306345800003

According to the Fischer ratio, granular activated carbon of XHJ-200 (200mesh) showed the best way to remove aromatic amino acids and its optimal parameters were pH value of 6.0, adsorption time of 2.5hr, temperature of 25 degrees C, and solid-liquid ratio of 1:20. The Fischer ratio and average molecular weight of HFP were 21.12 (>20) and 779.9Da, respectively. In addition, the peptide profile of HFP was established using RP-HPLC and 23 oligopeptides isolated from HFP including 6 dipeptides, 9 tripeptides, 3 tetrapeptides, and 5 pentapeptides were identified using protein amino acid sequence analyzer and mass spectrum. Furthermore, HFP exhibited high radical scavenging activity, reducing power, and lipid peroxidation inhibition capability. Practical applicationsHigh Fischer ratio oligopeptides (HFO) is a kind of small peptide mixture with the mole ratio of branched-chain amino acids (BCAA) to aromatic amino acids (AAA) higher than 20, which has drawn a great attention due to its great potential in clinical nutrition approaches for the treatment of liver disease when amino acid composition is out of proportion characterized by low levels of BCAA and high levels of AAA in the systemic blood. Antarctic krill is regarded as the largest animal protein resource for various food and pharmaceutical products. However, there is no report on the preparation of HFO of Antarctic krill (HFP). Therefore, the aim of the present study was to investigate the preparation process, peptide profiles and in vitro antioxidant activity of HFP. This study will potentially enhance the value-added utilization of Antarctic krill by making it an important raw material in the health-promoting functional products.																	0145-8884	1745-4514				MAY	2019	43	5							e12827	10.1111/jfbc.12827							WOS:000468395500011	31353526

Mice were fed a low-fat control diet or a 3% (w/w) krill powder low-fat diet for 3 months. Gene expression profiling on liver samples revealed that the krill powder supplemented diet modulated a large number of pathways compared to the control diet. Metabolic pathways that were down-regulated included beta-oxidation, glucose metabolism, and amino acid catabolism. In contrast, the mitochondrial electron transport chain pathway was upregulated. Krill powder affected more pathways involved in protein metabolism than krill oil. Thus, a krill powder supplemented diet had potent and specific effects on energy metabolism and oxidative phosphorylation at the gene level. This indicates that krill powder supplementation could be an approach to prevent decline in mitochondrial respiratory chain function. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Such variability was likely related to advected populations having spent variable lengths of time in the area studied. Lipid content and class among organs were studied in 5 body fractions: abdomen, stomach, digestive gland, gonad and fat body. In absolute terms, the highest concentrations were observed in the ovaries of mature females and the abdomens of the other stages. In relative terms (% dry weight), the digestive gland displayed the highest level, except in mature females. Distribution varied with stages, with low triglyceride levels in abdomen tissues of most stages and in the fat body and stomach fractions of subadults. High triglyceride levels were recorded in the other fractions for post spawning females and males, as well as in the fat body fraction for mature females and in subadult gonads. A reverse pattern was observed for the relative content of phosphatidyl choline. Phosphatidyl ethanolamine showed maximum values in the abdomen and the gonad. Glycolipid percentages were maximum in the abdomen, suggesting a structural role. The roles of the different lipid classes are discussed with respect to the function of the organ.																	0171-8630						1998	173						149	162		10.3354/meps173149							WOS:000077093600013						
J	Pauly, T; Penrose, JD				Pauly, T; Penrose, JD			Laboratory target strength measurements of free-swimming Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba)	JOURNAL OF THE ACOUSTICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA												Target strength measurements of free-swimming krill at 120 kHz were made using a single-beam monostatic system in a 10-m(3) laboratory tank. Krill (grouped according to length classes) swam freely in the tank triggering a data acquisition system when generating a backscattered signal larger than a threshold, determined by the system noise level. Dorsal and ventral target strength estimates were calculated indirectly by deconvolution of the cumulative probability function of echo ensembles of single-animal insonifications. For mean length classes in the range [29.6 to 36.2] mm the median single-animal target strengths are in the range [-76.7 to -71.8] dB. Monte Carlo computer simulations were used to evaluate the effects of varying the ratio of largest to smallest echo amplitudes for a given ensemble, thus enabling the estimation of threshold induced bias in the target strength estimates. The threshold induced bias was then determined for each ensemble of experimental data and used to determine corrections which were in the range of [-0.84 to -0.33] dB. An error analysis of the target strength estimates detailing the components due to measurement accuracy and precision, and the indirect signal processing techniques used is also presented.

Multibeam echosounder observations reveal interactions between Antarctic krill and air-breathing predators	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												A multibeam echosounder (MBE) was deployed on an inflatable boat (length = 5.5 m) to observe swarms of Antarctic krill Euphausia superba in the nearshore environment off Livingston Island, South Shetland Islands, Antarctica. Visual observations of air-breathing predators, including penguins and fur seals, were made from the boat at the same time. MBEs extend the 2-dimensional acoustic observations that can be made with conventional vertical echosounders to 3 dimensions, enabling direct observation of the surface areas and volumes of entire krill swarms. Krill swarms exhibited a wide range of various size metrics (e.g. height, length and width) but only a narrow range of surf ace-area-to-volume ratios or 'roughnesses', suggesting that krill adopt a consistent group behavior to maintain swarm shape. The variation in R was investigated using generalized additive models (GAMs). GAMs indicated that the presence of air-breathing predators influenced swarm shape (R decreased as the range to predators decreased, and the swarms became more spherical), as did swarm nearest-neighbor distance (R decreased with increasing distance) and swarm position in the water column (R decreased in the upper 70% of the water column). Therefore, swarm shape appears to be influenced by a combination of behavioral responses to predator presence and environmental variables. MBEs have the potential to contribute much to studies of krill, and can provide data to improve our understanding of the behavior of krill in situ.

J	Hagen, W; VanVleet, ES; Kattner, G				Hagen, W; VanVleet, ES; Kattner, G			Seasonal lipid storage as overwintering strategy of Antarctic krill	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												Conflicting hypotheses prevail on the overwintering strategies of the Antarctic krill Euphausia superba due to the difficult accessibility of Antarctic waters, especially in winter, and hence, to the lack of seasonal data. This study reports on the seasonal lipid dynamics of E. superba (25 to 56 mm) collected in the Weddell Sea in late winter/spring, summer, autumn and mid-winter. Total lipid data provide evidence of large seasonal accumulation of reserve lipids in austral summer with a mean Lipid content of 28.2% of dry mass and particularly in autumn, when mean lipid levels peak with 39.2% of dry mass. After the overwintering period mean lipid contents decrease to a minimum of 10.5% of dry mass, indicating extensive utilisation of lipid reserves during winter. These data suggest that lipids contribute significantly to the overwintering success of this extremely versatile species. Lipid class analyses of spring and summer specimens (10 to 56 mm) from the Antarctic Peninsula and the Weddell Sea revealed that not only triacylglycerol, but also phosphatidylcholine may serve as important storage lipids of E. superba. In the other dominant Antarctic krill species, E. crystallorophias (10 to 40 mm) and Thysanoessa macrura (10 to 27 mm), wax esters are the primary depot lipid, but phosphatidylcholine also functions as a storage lipid in these species. Phosphatidylcholine is unusual as a reserve lipid, being an essential component of biomembranes. In contrast, phosphatidylethanolamine, the other major phospholipid class, seems to have exclusively membrane functions, since it does not increase (in percent of dry mass) with increasing lipid levels in these 3 euphausiid species.

Regional differences in quality of krill and fish as prey along the Western Antarctic Peninsula	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												The warming trend in the northern part of the Western Antarctic Peninsula (WAP) has led to a decrease in perennial and summer sea ice, an increase in heat content over the shelf, and lower phytoplankton biomass, which could affect the prey quality of krill and fish that are utilized by apex predators. We compared prey quality metrics, including elemental (C, N) content; total, neutral, and polar lipid content; and energy densities of known penguin prey items including krill (Euphausia superba, Thysanoessa macrura, and E. crystallorophias) and fish (silverfish Pleuragramma antarcticum and the myctophid Electrona antarctica) along the WAP latitudinal gradient each January from 2009 to 2011. E. antarctica had the highest prey quality in terms of lipid content and energy density, followed by T. macrura and P. antarcticum, then E. crystallorophias and E. superba. For all species, variations in C and N content were most strongly correlated with the animals' neutral lipid content, in that animals with the larger neutral lipid stores had significantly higher C and lower N content. Across all sexes and maturity stages, E. superba in the southern study region had ca. 20% higher total lipid content than E. superba in the north, and a stepwise multiple linear regression analysis showed that latitude, sexual differences, and upper water column temperatures best explained this regional difference in lipid content. This regional variability in E. superba prey quality could affect the ability of apex predators that rely on E. superba to meet their energetic demands, and should be considered in future modeling efforts.																	0171-8630	1616-1599					2014	509						39	55		10.3354/meps10868							WOS:000341570100004

ENSO and variability of the Antarctic Peninsula pelagic marine ecosystem	ANTARCTIC SCIENCE												The West Antarctic Peninsula region is an important source of Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) in the Southern Ocean. From 1980-2004 abundance and concentration of phytoplankton and zooplankton, krill reproductive and recruitment success and seasonal sea ice extent here were significantly correlated with the atmospheric Southern Oscillation Index and exhibited three- to five-year frequencies characteristic of El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) variability. This linkage was associated with movements of the Southern Antarctic Circumpolar Current Front and Boundary, a changing influence of Antarctic Circumpolar Current and Weddell Sea waters, and eastward versus westward flow and mixing processes that are consistent with forcing by the Antarctic Dipole high-latitude climate mode. Identification of hydrographic processes underlying ecosystem variability presented here were derived primarily from multidisciplinary data collected during 1990-2004, a period with relatively stable year-to-year sea ice conditions. These results differ from the overwhelming importance of seasonal sea ice development previously established using 1980-1996 data, a period marked by a major decrease in sea ice from the Antarctic Peninsula region in the late 1980s. These newer results reveal the more subtle consequences of ENSO variability on biological responses. They highlight the necessity of internally consistent long-term multidisciplinary datasets for understanding ecosystem variability and ultimately for establishing well-founded ecosystem management. Furthermore, natural environmental variability associated with interannual- and decadal-scale changes in ENSO forcing must be considered when assessing impacts of climate warming in the Antarctic Peninsula-Weddell Sea region.

Weight loss during breeding is adaptive for female macaroni penguins, Eudyptes chrysolophus	EVOLUTIONARY ECOLOGY RESEARCH												Question: How does the female macaroni penguin balance her own needs with those of her chick during breeding? Features of the model: We model the behaviour of female macaroni penguins during a sensitive life-history stage as a function of the availability of their main prey species, Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba), using stochastic dynamic programming. In the model, females maximize accumulated delivery to the chick, accounting for metabolic losses. Chick fullness is included as a state in the model. Range of key variables: We test three scenarios for krill availability, which changes with distance from the nest. In the first, krill abundance increases with distance from the nest, with no variability in the reward at each distance. In the second, variability increases proportionally with the increasing amount of krill available at each distance from the nest. In the third, the abundance of krill at each distance from the nest is constant, but variability decreases further from the nest. Conclusions: Natural selection should produce females that sacrifice their own condition to meet the increasing demands of their chicks. We predict a weight loss of 10-20%, which is comparable to the empirical average of 14%. We also predict that females will endure the cost of travelling further from the nest to obtain a more predictable meal of krill, even if the mean reward does not change with distance from the nest.																	1522-0613	1937-3791				NOV	2007	9	7					1053	1076									WOS:000251194600001						
J	Perissinotto, R; Pakhomov, EA				Perissinotto, R; Pakhomov, EA			Gut evacuation rates and pigment destruction in the Antarctic krill Euphausia superba	MARINE BIOLOGY												Krill grazing data collected during cruises in the region of the Antarctic Polar Front (S.A. ''Agulhas'' Voyage 70) and the South Georgia shelf (R,V. ''Africana'' Voyage 119) during the austral summer of 1993 were analyzed to estimate the variability of crucial parameters of the gut fluorescence technique in relation to food availability and krill feeding history. Gut evacuation rates (k) and passage or throughput times (1/k) varied in the ranges of 0.101 to 0.424 h(-1) and 2.3 to 9.9 h and were strongly correlated (p <0.001, r(2) = 0.98) to krill feeding activity (estimated as initial gut pigment content, G(o)) but not to ambient chlorophyll a concentration. A significant difference was found when k values derived from incubations in filtered seawater and low charcoal particle concentrations (0.4 to 0.8 mg l(-1)) were compared with values derived from krill fed high concentrations of charcoal (6 mg l(-1)). The efficiency of gut pigment destruction was among the highest recorded for zooplankton organisms, 58.1 to 98.4%, and did not covary significantly (p > 0.05) with ambient food concentration. However, the pigment lost per individual krill was strongly correlated with the total amount of pigment ingested(p < 0.001, r(2) = 0.99). We suggest that both gut evacuation rates and pigment destruction efficiency may be realistically estimated only when krill is allowed to continue ingesting particles uninterruptedly. Charcoal particle concentration should be equivalent to the in situ wet weight of total seston per unit volume. An objective criterion for the standardization of the measurement and calculation of k values is also proposed.																	0025-3162					MAR	1996	125	1					47	54		10.1007/BF00350759							WOS:A1996UD84100005

Throughout the survey, multi-frequency echosounder data and ancillary environmental data were collected to determine the distribution and abundance of Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) and to explore its broad relationship with the bio-physical environment. The acoustic data were analysed using three different methods to provide measurements of krill abundance that can be set in context with previous studies. Based on the most recently developed acoustic method, the mean biomass-density of krill across the survey area (1.3 million km(2)) was estimated to be 24 g m(-2). Total biomass was estimated to be 28.75 million tonnes (Mt) with a coefficient of variation (CV) of 16.18%. This biomass estimate has been used by the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR) to update the precautionary catch limit for krill in this area (CCAMLR Division 58.4.2) from 0.450 to 2.645 Mt. Overall, krill were widely distributed at relatively low densities: 25% of the 2-km along-track echo-integration intervals were devoid of krill, 50% registered densities of 1 g m(-2) of krill or less and 75% registered densities of 12 g m(-2) or less. Mean densities were highest in the waters to the south of the Southern Boundary (SB) of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC), while the waters to the north of the Southern ACC Front (SACCF) were almost devoid of krill. Half of the cumulative krill density across the survey was found within 80 km of the 1000 m isobath (the shelf break), and 40% within 40 km. This was mostly due to particularly high densities (up to 4400 g m(-2)) around the shelf break on 3 of the 11 transects surveyed. The majority of acoustic krill detections were in the top 100 m of the water column, centred around 50 m depth.

Krill (Euphausia superba) abundance and Adelie penguin (Pygoscelis adeliae) breeding performance in the waters off the Bechervaise Island colony, East Antarctica in 2 years with contrasting ecological conditions	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY												In 2001 and 2003 small-scale acoustic surveys of Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) distribution and abundance were conducted offshore from an East Antarctic colony of Adelie penguins on Bechervaise Island (67 degrees 35'S, 62 degrees 49'E) that has been monitored for 15 years. Although the distribution of krill was similar between the two summers, their abundance in 2001 was estimated to be 3 times higher than in 2003. This biomass difference was reflected in the breeding performance of the penguins at the monitored colony. Significant differences were observed between the two seasons in foraging trip duration during chick rearing, breeding success, meal mass and dietary composition. Penguins travelled further to forage in 2003 than 2001, stayed away longer and brought back smaller meals. Fish (mostly Pleuragramma antarcticum) contributed significantly to the diet in 2003 but were only a minor component in 2001. Differences between years were particularly apparent during the late guard to early creche stages of chick rearing, coinciding with the timing of the krill survey. Chick mortality peaked during this period also. Krill demographics showed little difference between the 2 years. Oceanographically, the two summers differed; in 2003 the mixed layer was fresher and shallower, indicating a delayed melting of sea-ice in the study area when compared to 2001. Satellite observations indicated that the pack-ice directly offshore from the Mawson coast broke out earlier in 2001 and the perennial fast-ice along the coast persisted later in 2003.

Mercedes			Size structure of Antarctic krill inferred from samples of Pygoscelid penguin diets and those collected by the commercial krill fishery	MARINE BIOLOGY												In the Antarctic Peninsula, during the chick-rearing period Adelie (Pygoscelis adeliae) and gentoo (P. papua) penguins feed primarily on Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba), which is also exploited by the commercial fishery. Krill length and proportion of juvenile krill consumed by these predators that breed at Stranger Point, South Shetland Islands (from 2007/2008 to 2015/2016), and those collected by the krill fishery in the Mar de la Flota/Bransfield Strait (from 2009/2010 to 2015/2016) were compared to evaluate the potential of each data source as an indicator of changes in the size composition and so, in the demographic structure of the krill population. Overall, the mean krill size taken by gentoo penguins was larger than that ingested by Adelie penguins, which consumed higher proportions of juvenile (<= 35 mm) and one-year-old (<= 25 mm) krill. Although the krill size caught by the fishery was statistically similar to that taken by both penguin species, there were differences in the frequency distributions of krill size among the three databases. Furthermore, when only adult krill (> 35 mm) was considered, the three sources of krill data showed a similar inter-annual variation in the availability of adult krill cohorts. Our findings suggest that each database analysed here can potentially provide different information (although complementary) about krill size composition. In addition, inter-annual fluctuations in the smaller size classes of krill likely reflect their first year of recruitment and, therefore, may be used as an indicator of shifts in local krill availability.

J	Karlsen, O; Suontama, J; Olsen, RE				Karlsen, Orjan; Suontama, Jorma; Olsen, Rolf Erik			Effect of Antarctic krillmeal on quality of farmed Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua L.)	AQUACULTURE RESEARCH												Farmed Atlantic cod with a mean weight of 4.8 kg were maintained for 9 weeks in sea cages and fed diets where the dietary fishmeal component was substituted with increasing proportions (0%, 22%, 63% and 100%) of meal from Antarctic krill, Euphausia superba. Wild-caught cod were included in the study as external control. At termination of feeding, all fish were slaughtered and muscle pH was immediately recorded. The fish were then stored on ice for three days and assessed for muscle pH and objective (skin and fillet colour, and fillet texture) and subjective (sensory evaluation) quality criteria. Replacement of fishmeal with krillmeal in the diets resulted in the skin colour above and below the lateral line to be more red than the control group without krillmeal substitutions, even though this difference was not significant, and with more yellow hue. Additions of krillmeal increased the muscle whiteness and yellow hue compared with the control group and wild fish. There was no difference in red hue between the groups. Muscle pH, texture or sensory attributes were unaffected by dietary inclusion level of krillmeal. Wild-caught cod deviated in several aspects from the farmed cod. It is concluded that the replacement of fishmeal with Antarctic krillmeal in the diets two months before slaughter did not move the sensory attributes more towards wild fish.

The purified enzyme (62.6 kDa; 2.62 unit/mg) was unstable at temperatures exceeding 30 degrees C. Denaturants, such as sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), guanidine HCl, and urea, were applied to evaluate the folding mechanism, including kinetics and thermodynamics, of krill ALP. Sodium dodecyl sulfate elicited no significant effect on ALP activity even at excessively high concentrations (300 mM), whereas guanidine HCl and urea effectively inactivated the enzyme at concentrations of 2 and 3.5 M, respectively. Kinetic studies showed that the enzymatic inhibition by guanidine HCl and urea represented a first-order reaction that was a monophasic unfolding process. This process was found to be associated with conformational changes without significant transient free-energy changes. Additionally, the overall structural changes occurred proximally to the active site pocket. Our study provides new insight into ALP of the Antarctic krill, which lives in extreme environmental conditions. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

A quantitative relationship between the fluoride concentration in the aqueous solution and the dielectric loss at 0.3GHz was also established with a regression coefficient over 0.98. The concentrations of fluoride in fresh and dried krill samples with different krill positions, such as shell and meat, were determined. The detected value agrees well with that determined using other methods, such as fluoride ion-selective electrode (ISE) and potassium permanganate titration (PPT). The fluoride concentrations in fresh krill were 0.0127, 0.0133, and 0.0152 mg/mL using dielectric spectroscopy, PPT, and ISE, respectively. These results show that the proposed dielectric loss technique is suitable and effective for determining fluoride content in Antarctic krill.																	0253-2964	1229-5949				JUN	2015	36	6					1557	1562		10.1002/bkcs.10295							WOS:000355986100002

In krill this involves partial digestion and resorption of the old exoskeleton and synthesis of new cuticle. Molecular events that underlie the moult cycle are poorly understood in calcifying crustaceans and even less so in non-calcifying organisms such as krill. To address this we constructed an Antarctic krill cDNA microarray in order to generate gene expression profiles across the moult cycle and identify possible activation pathways. Results: A total of 26 different cuticle genes were identified that showed differential gene expression across the moult cycle. Almost all cuticle genes were up regulated during premoult and down regulated during late intermoult. There were a number of transcripts with significant sequence homology to genes potentially involved in the synthesis, breakdown and resorption of chitin. During early premoult glutamine synthetase, a gene involved in generating an amino acid used in the synthesis of glucosamine, a constituent of chitin, was up regulated more than twofold. Mannosyltransferase 1, a member of the glycosyltransferase family of enzymes that includes chitin synthase was also up regulated during early premoult. Transcripts homologous to a beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase (beta-NAGase) precursor were expressed at a higher level during late intermoult (prior to apolysis) than during premoult. This observation coincided with the up regulation during late intermoult, of a coatomer subunit epsilon involved in the production of vesicles that maybe used to transport the beta-NAGase precursors into the exuvial cleft. Trypsin, known to activate the beta-NAGase precursor, was up regulated more than fourfold during premoult. The up regulation of a predicted oligopeptide transporter during premoult may allow the transport of chitin breakdown products across the newly synthesised epi- and exocuticle layers. Conclusion: We have identified many genes differentially expressed across the moult cycle of krill that correspond with known phenotypic structural changes. This study has provided a better understanding of the processes involved in krill moulting and how they may be controlled at the gene expression level.

J	SIEGEL, V				SIEGEL, V			ASSESSMENT OF THE KRILL (EUPHAUSIA-SUPERBA) SPAWNING STOCK OFF THE ANTARCTIC PENINSULA	ARCHIV FUR FISCHEREIWISSENSCHAFT												A net sampling survey for krill was carried out by RV 'Meteor' along the Antarctic Peninsula from 26 December 1989 to 14 January 1990. Results were compared with data from a survey conducted by RV 'Polarstern' in 1987/88. Krill were distributed over 80% (89% in 1987/88) of the survey area. Main concentrations were observed near Elephant Island, King George Island, in the central Bransfield Strait and on the south-western shelf of the Peninsula. Four distinct site clusters of krill size classes and maturity stages were found, confirming the spatial succession of maturity stages from nearshore (7% juveniles, 84% early subadult stages) to oceanic waters (97%) gravid and spent stages). The spawning area can be characterized as a continuous belt with some local higher densities. Almost no gravid females occurred in Bransfield Strait waters. First occurrence of spent females indicated the onset of the breeding season in early january. juvenile krill of age group 1+ (year-class 1988/89) was almost missing in the stock. Total amount of krill was higher in 1987/88 than in 1989/90. Stratified mean biomass integrated over 200 m depth was 4.5 g/m2 and 6.13 g/m2 in 1987/88. Total instantaneous biomass was calculated as 1.16 - 10(6) tonnes (1989/90) and 1.65 . 10(6) tonnes (1987/88), respectively. More than 96% of the krill biomass occurred in the upper 0-60 m depth stratum. Seasonal variation between summer and winter abundance/biomass data exceeded a factor of 35 times, while interannual variability between available summer surveys reached only a factor of 1.6 times. Krill mortality was calculated by linearized catch curve analysis and resulted in a rate of Z=M=0.88 (1989/90) and 0.96 (1987/88). Production was estimated and resulted in a P/B ratio of 0.88 to 0.94 for different years. The exchange rate of water masses and krill biomass within one summer season was roughly estimated as 2 times from which follows a maximum total effective biomass (including production) of 4.3 and 5.0 . 10(6) tonnes passing through the survey area during the respective summers.																	0003-9063					JUN	1992	41	2					101	130									WOS:A1992HX59400001						
J	Brown, M; Kawaguchi, S; Candy, S; Virtue, P				Brown, Matthew; Kawaguchi, So; Candy, Steven; Virtue, Patti			Temperature effects on the growth and maturation of Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba)	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY												This paper describes growth and maturation of individual Antarctic krill for a complete annual cycle in an artificially controlled environment. Antarctic krill were kept individually and maintained under temperature regimes of -1, 1 and 3 degrees C. while light conditions simulated natural seasonal conditions for the 14 months of the experiment starting in April. The growth increment (GI), instantaneous growth rate (IGR), daily growth rate (DGR), intermoult period (IMP) and maturity scores (MS) were tracked by measuring the consecutively moulted exoskeletons and modelled using linear mixed models (LMMs). There was a clear seasonal trend in growth and maturity in the three different temperature treatments. Males generally reached peak growth rates and matured earlier than females, but females showed higher growth rates overall. Negative growth occurred towards the end of January for both males and females, coinciding with the regression of external sexual characteristics. There was, as expected, a significant decline in IMP with increasing temperature, which was moderated by increasing trends with total length (TL) and month for the -1 degrees C treatment. For the 1 and 3 degrees C treatments there was no relationship with TL and the season effect declined after October and December, respectively. For krill with a TL of 40 mm in October, the predicted mean IMP values at -1, 1 and 3 degrees C were 28 days, 24 days and 19 days, respectively. There was some evidence to suggest that 1 degrees C was optimum for growth, as the IMP was significantly lower than at -1 degrees C but the difference in Cl between the two temperatures was not significantly different from zero, while all growth variables were significantly lower for the 3 compared to the -1 degrees C treatment. For the first time, this study has been able to confirm, by fitting a bivariate LMM, that compensation mechanisms do exist between IMP and IGR and to quantify the degree of compensation at both the between- and within-animal levels. This will allow modelling of growth trajectories in the wild to quantify the distribution of length given age. Crown Copyright (C) 2009 Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Distributions of krill and Antarctic silverfish and correlations with environmental variables in the western Ross Sea, Antarctica	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												Antarctic krill Euphausia superba, crystal krill E. crystallorophias, and Antarctic silverfish Pleuragramma antarctica are key mid-trophic level species in the Ross Sea, connecting primary production to the upper trophic levels. Distributions of these species were constructed from observations made in the western Ross Sea from 1988 to 2004. Distributions of environmental conditions were obtained from a 5-km resolution circulation model (temperature, mixed layer depth, surface speed) and satellite-derived observations (chlorophyll, sea ice cover). A hierarchy of statistical methods determined correlations and relationships between species and environmental conditions. Each species occupies a localized habitat defined by different environmental characteristics. Antarctic krill are concentrated along the northwestern shelf break in a habitat characterized by deep (>1000 m) bottom depth, warm temperature (1 to 1.25 degrees C), decreased sea ice, and proximity to the shelf break. Crystal krill and Antarctic silverfish are concentrated in Terra Nova Bay. Common characteristics of the habitat for these species are southwesterly location, coastal proximity, and cold temperature (-1.75 to -2 degrees C). The habitat characteristics obtained for the 3 species provide a basis for projecting potential distribution changes in response to environmental change and for delineating regions of the Ross Sea for focused management and selection of marine protected areas that support ecosystem-level conservation plans.

J	Arana, PM; Rolleri, R				Arana, Patricio M.; Rolleri, Renzo			Incidental catch of marine organisms registered in the Chilean Antarctic krill fishery, years 2012-2016	LATIN AMERICAN JOURNAL OF AQUATIC RESEARCH												Krill (Euphausia superba) catch is currently the most relevant fishery industry in Antarctic waters. This resource is a keystone species in the Antarctic food web, sustaining the contribution to the trophic ecology of many invertebrate and vertebrate species. To catch hill, part of the fleet in this fishery uses large mid-water nets that also retain a diversity of other organisms like plankton, meroplankton, and fish species as bycatch. Therefore, it is necessary to understand and evaluate the magnitude of this incidental catch, as well as the potential interactions between hill fishing gear with seabirds and mammals. To estimate the composition and extent of bycatch for this fishery included 784 samples of 25 kg and an equal number of 1 kg sub-samples obtained from Antarctic hill catches in Subarea 48, between years 2012 and 2016. A total of 15 fish species were identified along with the record of five other taxa and other unidentified specimens. The most relevant fish species bycaught by weight were mackerel icefish Champsocephalus gunnari, South Georgia icefish Pseudochaenichthys georgianus, and painted notie Lepidonotothen larseni. Additionally, 20 interactions with seabirds and nine interactions with Antarctic fur seals (Arctocephalus gazella) were registered. In the five years of operations, only three seabirds died, and only two individuals of A. gazelle caught by the net were killed.																	0718-560X	0717-7178					2020	48	3					429	439		10.3856/vol48-issue3-fulltext-2434							WOS:000547330500008

Prey differences drive local genetic adaptation in Antarctic fur seals	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												Antarctic fur seal (Arctocephalus gazella) colonies are found on sub-Antarctic islands around the continent. These islands experience a range of conditions in terms of physical and biological habitat, creating a natural laboratory to investigate local genetic adaptation. One striking habitat difference is in the availability of Euphausia superba krill as prey, which has led to A. gazella exhibiting a range of diets. A. gazella in some colonies consume exclusively krill, while their conspecifics in other colonies feed mainly on fish and consume few to no krill. To investigate potential adaptations to these different prey fields, reduced representation genome sequencing was conducted on A. gazella from the 8 major colonies. Twenty-seven genomic regions exhibiting signatures of natural selection were identified. Two of these genomic regions were clearly associated with seals living in krill-dominated areas or those in fish-dominated areas. Twenty-two additional genomic regions under selection showed a pattern consistent with prey differences as the driver of selection after historical migrations from krill-dominated habitats where lineages evolved to present krill-poor habitat areas were taken into account. Only 1 of the genomic regions identified appeared to be explained by any other environmental variable analysed (depth). Genomic regions under prey-driven selection included genes associated with regulation of gene expression, skeletal development, and lipid metabolism. Adaptation to local prey has implications for spatial management of this species and for the potential impacts of climate- or harvest-driven reductions in krill abundance on these seals.

Two survey areas were sampled focussed on Marguerite Bay in the south, and the tip of the Antarctic Peninsula in the north. Data from 177 stations showed that the highest concentrations of krill were found in the southern sampling area. Differences between areas were associated with a few large catches of one year old krill found in anomalously warm and productive waters in Marguerite Bay, and small krill catches in the less-productive, offshore waters in the north. Estimated krill density across the survey area was 3.4 krill m(-2), and was low compared to the long-term average of 45 krill m(-2) for the Elephant Island area. Overall recruitment between the two survey regions was similar, but per capita recruitment was about 60% lower than historical mean recruitment levels measured at Elephant Island since the late 1970s. Demographic patterns showed small krill concentrated near the coast, and large krill concentrated offshore on the shelf and slope all along the survey area. The offshore distribution of adult krill was delineated by the warm (similar to 1 degrees C), low salinity (33.8) water at 30 m, suggesting that most krill were present shoreward of the southern boundary of Antarctic Circumpolar Current Front. Distributions of larvae indicated that three hotspot areas were important for the production of krill: slope areas outside Marguerite Bay and north of the South Shetland Islands, and near the coast around Antarctic Sound. Successful spawning, as inferred from larval abundance, was roughly coincident with the shelf break and not with inshore waters. Given the rapid changes in climate along the Antarctic Peninsula and the lower per capita recruitment observed in recent years, studies comparing and contrasting production, growth, and recruitment across the Peninsula will be critical to better understand how climate change will impact krill populations and their dependent predators in the Scotia Sea.

Stable isotope analyses (C-13/C-12 and N-15/N-14) were used to compare the dietary preferences and trophic relationships of major zooplankton species under pack ice during two winter spring transitions (2007 and 2012). During sampling, furcilia of Euphausia superba demonstrated dietary plasticity between years, herbivory when feeding on sea-ice biota, and with a more heterotrophic diet when feeding from both the sea ice and the water column. Carbon isotope signatures suggested that the pteropod Limacina helicina, small copepods Oithona spp., ostracods and amphipods relied heavily on sea ice biota. Post larval E. superba and omnivorous krill Thysanoessa macrura consumed both water column and ice biota, but further investigations are needed to estimate the contribution from each source. Large copepods and chaetognaths overwintered on a water column-based diet. Our study suggests that warm and permeable sea ice is more likely to provide food for zooplankton species under the ice than the colder ice. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Zhao, L; Yin, BZ; Liu, Q; Cao, R				Zhao Ling; Yin Bangzhong; Liu Qi; Cao Rong			Purification of antimicrobial peptide from Antarctic Krill (Euphausia superba) and its function mechanism	JOURNAL OF OCEAN UNIVERSITY OF CHINA												The preliminary purification and antimicrobial mechanism of antimicrobial peptide from Antarctic Krill were studied in this paper. The results showed that the molecular weight range of antimicrobial polypeptide (CMCC-1) obtained by cation exchange chromatography was between 245-709D as detected by molecular sieve chromatography, and the minimum inhibition concentration (MIC) of CMCC-1 against Staphylococcus aureus was 5.0 mg mL(-1). The antimicrobial mechanism of CMCC-1 was studied with S. aureus as indicator bacterium. Compared with control group, the results of the experimental group in which S. aureus was treated with CMCC-1 were as follows: 1) CMCC-1 could inhibit cell division at logarithmic phase. 2) The protein and reducing sugar content, and the conductivity of culture medium increased, and the activity of alkaline phosphatase and beta-galactosidase could be detected in the culture medium. 3) Observation under scanning electron microscope revealed that somatic morphology became irregular, and then somatic surface became coarse. The cell became much smaller, and most somatic cells gathered. The boundary between cells became dim and finally fused as a whole. 4) Observation under transmission electron microscope showed that the surface of S. aureus became rough and the reproducing ability was restrained. The cell wall became thin and the cytoplasm shrunk. Substances inside cell leaked out, which caused cells death. 5) SDS-PAGE analysis showed that some bands disappeared, and the residual bands became vague. 6) The genomic DNA electrophoresis results showed that the genomic DNA bands of S. aureus were not degraded but the brightness significantly reduced. Thus, it is supposed that CMCC-1 could destroy the cell wall and membrane of S. aureu, increase the cell membrane permeability and the leaking-out of intracellular substances, and thus cause the death of S. aureu.																	1672-5182	1993-5021				SEP	2013	12	3					484	490		10.1007/s11802-013-2180-2							WOS:000322258300021

BHT was separated from the volatile oil of Antarctic krill using high performance thin layer chromatography (HPTLC) with petroleum ether/ethyl acetate/hexane (4:1:0.5, v/v/v) was used as the developing solvent. The content of BHT in volatile oil was 9.20mg/g and the content of BHT in dried Antarctic krill was 0.35mg/g (0.070mg/g in frozen whole Antarctic krill). The linearity, accuracy, stability, and recovery of the analysis showed that HPTLC is the most suitable method for the determination of BHT in Antarctic krill. The BHT crude sample was obtained by scraping the separated spot in the thin layer chromatography plate, which was then analyzed using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The resulting sample was identified with 96.05% purity based on the HPLC analysis. The structure of BHT was determined using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The results of the HPLC and GC-MS analysis validated the HPTLC method. BHT is a widely used antioxidant in food, pharmaceuticals, and in industrial production. The exploitation and utilization of BHT in Antarctic krill is of great economic value.																	1082-6076	1520-572X					2017	40	14					725	731		10.1080/10826076.2017.1357570							WOS:000415802300003

The extrudates were hard and porous agglomerates. The pellets still showed intact structure without obvious disintegration in response to hexane extraction. The oil recovery rates for raw krill meal and the extrudate of single krill meal were 55.08% and 59.08%, respectively. For extrudates, oil recovery rate increased along with the increasing additive amount of starches, with a maximum of 83.13%. Oil extracted from raw krill meal contained 49.30% of triglycerides (TG), 44.16% of phospholipids (PL), 1.45% of free fatty acids (FFA) and 4.69% of cholesterols (CHO). Meanwhile, polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) and saturated fatty acids (SFA) account for 20.89%, 37.84% and 41.27% of the total fatty acids, respectively. By contrast, oils extracted from extrudates contained more TG but less PL and more SFA but less PUFA.

Its characteristics were examined by biochemical and immunohistochemical techniques. The major a component of the krill collagen, referred to as a I(Kr) component, occupied more than 80% of the total pepsin-solubilized collagen and showed typical compositional feature of crustacean major collagens, with low and high contents of alanine and hydroxylysine, respectively. The alpha 1(Kr) component was mainly distributed in relatively thick connective tissues, epimysium and perimysium. These results suggest that the alpha 1(Kr) component may functionally correspond to the major ct component of collagen in decapods, alpha 1(AR-I) (AR-I: Arthropod-Type I), and comprise a major homotrimeric collagen molecule, [alpha 1(AR-I)(3)].

We examined swarms across the Scotia Sea in January and February 2003 using a Simrad EK60 (38 and 120 kHz) echosounder, concurrent with net sampling. The acoustic data were analysed through applying a swarm-identification algorithm and then filtering out all non-krill targets. The area, length, height, depth, packing-concentration and inter-swarm distance of 4525 swarms was derived by this method. Hierarchical clustering revealed 2 principal swarm types, which differed in both their dimensions and packing-concentrations. Type 1 swarms were generally small (<50 m long) and were not very tightly packed (<10 in.m(-3)), whereas type 2 swarms were an order of magnitude larger and had packing concentrations up to 10 times greater. Further subdivisions of these types identified small and standard swarms within the type 1 group and large and superswarms within the type 2 group. A minor group (swarm type 3) was also found, containing swarms that were isolated (>100 km away from the next swarm). The distribution of swarm types over the survey grid was examined with respect to a number of potential explanatory variables describing both the environment and the internal-state of krill (namely maturity, body length, body condition). Most variables were spatially averaged over scales of similar to 100 km and so mainly had a mesoscale perspective. The exception was the level of light (photosynthetically active radiation (PAR)) for which measurements were specific to each swarm. A binary logistic model was constructed from four variables found to have significant explanatory power (P < 0.05): surface fluorescence, PAR, krill maturity and krill body length. Larger (type 2) swarms were more commonly found during nighttime or when it was overcast during the day, when surface fluorescence was low, and when the krill were small and immature. A strong pattern of diel vertical migration was not observed although the larger and denser swarms tended to occur more often at night than during the day. The vast majority of krill were contained within a minor fraction of the total number of swarms. These krill-rich swarms were more common in areas dominated by small and immature krill. We propose that, at the mesoscale level, the structure of swarms switches from being predominantly large and tightly packed to smaller and more diffuse as krill grow and mature. This pattern is further modulated according to feeding conditions and then level of light. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

From April 13 to 24, 2016, acoustic data were collected along 24 survey lines using the frequencies 38 and 120 kHz, and middle trawling was performed at 7 stations. Using the difference between the dB values of two volume backscattering strength (Sv) frequencies (38 and 120 kHz), a clear acoustic distinction could be made between Antarctic krill (4.9 to 12.0 dB) and fish (-4.0 to -0.2 dB). The distributions and mean Sv of krill swarms in the Elephant Island peripheries and south of South Shetland Island were higher than those in the west of South Shetland Island. The mean length/ height ratio of krill swarms in the west of the South Shetland Island (64.5) was higher than that in the south (35.9) and the Elephant Island peripheries (33.8), with the length of the aggregations exceeding their height. Most krill swarms were distributed between the surface layer (less than 10 m below sea level) and within 200 m of water depth. These results are expected to serve as baseline data for evaluating krill density and biomass by distinguishing them from fish, using acoustics.																	1738-5261	2005-7172				DEC	2018	53	4					667	677		10.1007/s12601-018-0043-x							WOS:000454745000006

J	Sun, JN; Mao, XZ				Sun, Jianan; Mao, Xiangzhao			An environmental friendly process for Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) utilization using fermentation technology	JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION												Antarctic krill was efficiently fermented by Bacillus subtilis OKF04 after the optimization of fermentation conditions. Bio-active substances were detected in fermentation broth, including polypeptides (9.5 g/L), phenols (1.1 g/L), polysaccharides (200.8 mg/L), and free amino acids (3469.4 mg/L). The fermentation broth was found to be rich in essential amino acids and non-protein amino acids, particularly methionine, leucine, lysine, and taurine. The fermentation broth was separated into 4 fractions: AKF-I (<1 kDa), AKF-II (1-3 kDa), AKF-III (3-5 kDa), and AKF-IV (>5 kDa), using membrane ultrafiltration. Antioxidative properties of the fermentation broth fractions were investigated, using DPPH (2, 2-diphenyl-1-picryl-hydrazyl-hydrate) scavenging activity, metal chelating activity and reducing capacity. The results showed that AKF-I and AKF-II had higher antioxidant activities than other fractions and the entire fermentation broth. These results indicate that bio-active substrates could be effectively and cleanly produced using fermentation of Antarctic krill by B. subtilis, and the antioxidant activity (DPPH scavenging activity, metal chelating activity and reducing capacity) of the fermentation broth is enhanced by ultrafiltration.

To demonstrate and quantify these negative biases on both the estimates of biomass distribution and abundance, a time-depth-density analysis was performed. Data were collected, as part of the United States Antarctic Marine Living Resources Program (AMLR), in the vicinities of Elephant Island, Antarctica, during the austral summers of 1992 and 1993. Five surveys were conducted in 1992; two covered a 105 by 105 n.mi. area centered on Elephant Island, two encompassed a 60 by 35 n.mi. area immediately to the north of the Island, and one covered a 1 n.mi.(2) area centered on a large krill swarm to the west of Seal Island. The 1993 data include repetitions of the two small-area and two large-area surveys. Average krill volume densities were calculated for each hour as well as for three daily periods: day, twilight and night. These data were normalized and presented as a probability of daily average density. With spectral analysis to identify the frequencies of migration, a four-term periodic function was fitted to the probability density function of average daily biomass versus local apparent time. This function was transformed to create a temporal compensation function (TCF) for upwardly adjusting acoustic biomass estimates. The TCF was then applied to the original 1992 survey data; the resulting biomass estimates are an average of 49.5% higher than those calculated disregarding biases due to diel vertical migration. The effect of DVM on the estimates of krill distribution are illustrated by a comparison of compensated and uncompensated density maps of two 1992 surveys. Through this technique, high density krill areas are revealed where uncompensated maps indicated low densities.																	0967-0637					APR	1995	42	4					455	475		10.1016/0967-0637(94)E0005-C							WOS:A1995RG45600003

A partially purified krill extract (enzymatic debrider) intended for clinical use was electrophoretically characterized by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and by crossed immunoelectrophoresis (CIE) using polyclonal rabbit antibodies. 2. Three main types of proteolytic enzymes (serine proteinase, carboxypeptidase A and B) with mol. wts of 33,000, 28,000 and 35,000, respectively, could be separated by SDS-g-PAGE under reducing conditions. 3. Routine CIE analysis of krill samples revealed four protease-active immunoprecipitates. Two of these precipitates were associated with the proteinase activity, one with carboxypeptidase A and one with carboxypeptidase B. 4. Improving resolution of CIE by extending electrophoresis in the first dimension permitted separation of three serine proteinases of which two were isozymes (II and III) and the third one was unique (1). 5. Furthermore carboxypeptidase A could also be separated into two isozymes (AI and AII) while carboxypeptidase B still exhibited one single component. 6. Six individual immunoprecipitates were thus identified and proved to be related to the protease activity. Highly purified enzymes were used as references in CIE and tandem-CIE to establish identification of each enzyme in the krill mixture.																	0305-0491						1991	100	4					817	820		10.1016/0305-0491(91)90296-P							WOS:A1991GY67700027

The nature of this interaction is poorly understood, particularly during the critical period of winter-spring transition. To investigate the role of sea-ice and underlying water-column properties in structuring under-ice communities during late winter/early spring, we used a Surface and Under Ice Trawl to sample animals and environmental properties in the upper 2-m layer under the sea ice in the northern Weddell Sea from August to October 2013. The area of investigation was largely homogeneous in terms of hydrography and sea-ice coverage. We hypothesised that this apparent homogeneity in the physical regime was mirrored in the structure of the under-ice community. The under-ice community was numerically dominated by the copepods Stephos longipes, Ctenocalanus spp. and Calanus propinquus (altogether 67 %), and furcilia larvae of Antarctic krill Euphausia superba (30 %). In spite of the apparent homogeneity of the environment, abundance and biomass distributions at our sampling stations indicated the presence of three community types, following a geographical gradient in the investigation area: (1) high biomass, krill-dominated in the west, (2) high abundance, copepod-dominated in the east, and (3) low abundance, low biomass at the ice edge. Combined analysis with environmental data indicated that under-ice community structure was correlated with sea-ice coverage, chlorophyll a concentration, and bottom depth. The heterogeneity of the Antarctic under-ice community was probably also driven by other factors, such as advection, sea-ice drift, and seasonal progression. The response of under-ice communities to changing sea-ice habitats may thus considerably vary seasonally and regionally.

J	MARQUARDT, FH; CARRENO, RR				MARQUARDT, FH; CARRENO, RR			THE PRODUCTION OF COLORLESS CHITIN FROM ANTARCTIC KRILL (EUPHAUSIA-SUPERBA) SHELL WASTE	ARCHIV FUR FISCHEREIWISSENSCHAFT												Up to now, the pigments from the eyes of krill, caused an intense, in acetone non-extractable, pink coloration. In the course of a demineralisation (prior to a deproteinisation), the eyes lose their solid structure and change into a sticky mass, which retains their pigmentation. This mass attaches itself to the walls and baffles of the reactor, and in this way can be separated with ease from the suspension of solid shell residues. Treatment of these residues with acetone, followed by deproteinisation, yields colourless chitin. This technique for the removal of the pigmented eye-mass could be used to develop a process for the production of colourless chitin in industrial scales. The chitin-colouring eye pigments of krill were found to be of two types, which differ in their solubility in acetone. Aside from the well-known red acetone-soluble astaxanthines, a brown, acetone-insoluble pigmentation, was also observed, which was assumed to be the krill ommochrome and/or xanthomatin. If the chitin is coloured by a mixture of both types of pigments, the astaxanthines apparently lose their solubility in acetone.																	0003-9063					JUN	1992	41	2					159	163									WOS:A1992HX59400003						
J	Quetin, LB; Ross, RM				Quetin, LB; Ross, RM			Episodic recruitment in Antarctic krill Euphausia superba in the Palmer LTER study region	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												As part of the Palmer Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) program, the size structure of the population of Antarctic krill found between Anvers and Adelaide Islands west of the Antarctic Peninsula has been analyzed for patterns in recruitment success. The data were from a series of 11 cruises, 1 in spring (November 199 1) and 10 in summer (January 1993 to January 2002). A maximum-likelihood fitting procedure was used to fit a mixture of normal distributions to the length-density distributions derived from net data. The recruitment index was calculated as the proportion of age-class 1 krill of the total. Antarctic krill in the Palmer LTER region showed a pattern of episodic recruitment, with 2 strong year classes in succession followed by 3 or 4 moderate or poor year classes. The 2 strong year classes represented 85 to 90% of the krill caught for 5 or 6 yr, and as the absolute abundance of the year class declined due to mortality, so did the abundance of Antarctic krill in the region. The recruitment index was positively correlated with the absolute value of a seasonal El Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) index, with strongest recruitment during the neutral or moderate periods of ENSO. The mechanism underlying the strong link between the recruitment index and ENSO is most likely the effects of seasonal sea-ice dynamics on both reproduction and winter-over survival of the resulting larvae as previously documented.																	0171-8630	1616-1599					2003	259						185	200		10.3354/meps259185							WOS:000186029000016

A re-appraisal of the total biomass and annual production of Antarctic krill	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART I-OCEANOGRAPHIC RESEARCH PAPERS												Despite much research on Euphausia superba, estimates of their total biomass and production are still very uncertain. Recently, circumpolar krill databases, combined with growth models and revisions in acoustics have made it possible to refine previous estimates. Net-based databases of density and length frequency (KRILLBASE) yield a summer distributional range of similar to 19 x 10(6) km(2) and a mean total abundance of 8 x 10(14) post-larvae with biomass of 379 million tonnes (Mt). These values are based on a standardised net sampling method but they average over the period 1926-2004, during which krill abundance has fluctuated. To estimate krill biomass at the end of last century we combined the KRILLBASE map of relative krill density around Antarctica with an acoustics-derived biomass estimate of 37.3 Mt derived for the Scotia Sea area in 2000 by the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR). Thus the CCAMLR 2000 survey area contains 28% of the total stock, with total biomass of similar to 133 Mt in January-February 2000. Gross postlarval production is estimated conservatively at 342-536 Mt yr(-1), based on three independent methods. These are high values, within the upper range of recent estimates, but consistent with the concept of high energy throughput for a species of this size. The similarity between the three production estimates reflects a broad agreement between the three growth models used, plus the fact that, for a given population size, production is relatively insensitive to the size distribution of krill at the start of the growth season. These production values lie within the envelope of what can be supported from the Southern Ocean primary production system and what is required to support an estimated predator consumption of 128-470 Mt yr(-1). Given the range of recent acoustics estimates, plus the need for precautionary management of the developing krill fishery, our net-based data provide an alternative estimate of total krill biomass.

The power of ecosystem monitoring	AQUATIC CONSERVATION-MARINE AND FRESHWATER ECOSYSTEMS					Symposium in Honor of Professor John Croxall held at the British-Antarctic-Survey	APR 06-07, 2006	Cambridge, ENGLAND	British Antarctic Survey				1. Implementing an ecosystem approach to fisheries management requires an effective ecosystem monitoring programme, the utility of which depends upon its ability (measured by the statistical power) to detect effects that trigger management action. 2. Using data from a long-term ecosystem monitoring programme of the predators of Antarctic krill Euphausia superba at South Georgia together with a krill population model to simulate natural and fisheries induced variability in krill abundance, the power to detect the effects of different levels of fishing was examined. 3. The power to detect the effects of fishing using either the krill population or a combined predator response index was low (20-40% power after 20 years with the probability of a type I error (alpha) = 0.05). The power increased to > 50% when a was increased to 0.2 when the ability to detect change was greater with the predator response index than using the krill population itself. 4. The results indicate that although this monitoring programme has a proven ability to detect the effects of natural variability in krill abundance, its ability to detect the effects of fishing may be limited if there is a requirement for statistical significance at the 95% level. A situation where changing a produces a marked increase in statistical power, and the difference in the relative ecological costs of making type I and type II errors is likely to be high, may require a more flexible approach to choosing significance levels required to trigger management action. 5. Although long-term monitoring provides a wealth of basic ecological information it is essential to evaluate, the ability to detect specific changes in order that management action is not delayed because of an inability to detect an effect rather than the lack of an effect of the fishery.

J	Marin, VH; Delgado, LE				Marin, VH; Delgado, LE			A spatially explicit model of the Antarctic krill fishery off the south shetland islands	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS												We show the development of a spatially explicit ecosystem model for the Euphausia superba fishery in the South Shetland Islands area (Antarctic Peninsula). We generated a virtual ecosystem, using a spatial automaton-geographic information system technique, to study management scenarios. We used literature data to generate the advection field, the initial krill biomass, and the distribution and size of penguin colonies in the area. Parameters for the fishing fleet were extracted from analysis of Chilean krill-fishing vessels. The model assumes that krill are passive current drifters and that penguin foraging occurs in areas close to their colonies. We analyzed the effect that a simulated 20-vessel fishing fleet would have on the availability of prey, considering the krill flux due to advection. The results show that it would be reasonable to manage the krill fishery in the South Shetland Islands as an interconnected set of ecotrophic modules, allocating the fleet downstream from the main penguin foraging sector.

Krill-derived peptides are renowned for their antioxidant activities. Hence, these peptides may have protective effects against oxidative stress. Alcoholic liver disease is a prevalent cause of death worldwide. The present study explores the hepatoprotective effects of krill peptide hydrolysate fractions against ethanol-induced liver damage in BALB/c mice. Methods: Hydrolysis was carried out by mimicking the gastrointestinal digestion environment and the filtrate was fractionated based on molecular weight (<1 kDa, 1-3 kDa, and >3 kDa). The 1-3 kDa fraction (KPF), which indicated the highest antioxidant effect, was further investigated for its effect on weight and survival rate increase in mice and its influence on serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase, glutamic pyruvic transaminase, and liver cholesterol levels. Moreover, superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) levels were measured, followed by Nrf2 and HO-1 expression. Histopathology studies were conducted to assess hepatic tissue damage. Results: KPF enhanced the weight and survival rate of mice while reducing serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase, glutamic pyruvic transaminase, and liver cholesterol levels. Moreover, KPF upregulated SOD, CAT, and GPx in liver tissues, while downregulating tumor necrosis factor alpha and interleukin-6 mRNA expression. KPF further increased Nrf2 and HO-1 expression and suppressed ethanol-induced apoptotic proteins in the liver. Histopathology of KPF-treated mice showed less hepatic tissue damage compared to ethanol-treated mice. Conclusions: Hydrolysates and bioactive peptides prepared from krill can be employed as functional foods to enhance liver function and health. Further investigations of KPF could lead to the development of functional foods.

The details of the laboratory setup suitable for krill to school are described. Light intensity and food condition were found to affect krill swimming patterns and schooling behaviour. Krill swam in polarised groups and responded as a group to objects that produced sharp contrasts but not to less distinct objects. Schools broke up when they encountered dense phytoplankton patches, and aggregated more tightly when kept with a white featureless background. The diel nature of school formation was observed under simulated natural light conditions with stronger and tighter schools during daytime and no obvious schooling behaviour during night. These behavioural patterns are further discussed in terms of their costs and benefits of feeding and predation risk, in conjunction with the diel vertical migration behaviour of krill.

Impact of climate change on Antarctic krill	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												Antarctic krill Euphausia superba (hereafter 'krill') occur in regions undergoing rapid environmental change, particularly loss of winter sea ice. During recent years, harvesting of krill has in creased, possibly enhancing stress on krill and Antarctic ecosystems. Here we review the overall impact of climate change on krill and Antarctic ecosystems, discuss implications for an ecosystem-based fisheries management approach and identify critical knowledge gaps. Sea ice decline, ocean warming and other environmental stressors act in concert to modify the abundance, distribution and life cycle of krill. Although some of these changes can have positive effects on krill, their cumulative impact is most likely negative. Recruitment, driven largely by the winter survival of larval krill, is probably the population parameter most susceptible to climate change. Predicting changes to krill populations is urgent, because they will seriously impact Antarctic ecosystems. Such predictions, however, are complicated by an intense inter-annual variability in recruitment success and krill abundance. To improve the responsiveness of the ecosystem-based management approach adopted by the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR), critical knowledge gaps need to be filled. In addition to a better understanding of the factors influencing recruitment, management will require a better understanding of the resilience and the genetic plasticity of krill life stages, and a quantitative understanding of under-ice and benthic habitat use. Current precautionary management measures of CCAMLR should be maintained until a better understanding of these processes has been achieved. [GRAPHICS] .

We present a new method for staging sexual development of female krill, and a key which can be used for live animals and Formalin-fixed samples. The key takes into account female general appearance, thelycum development, ovarian morphology, and developmental steps of changes in the ovarian cells. This staging method is based on the results of a histological study of ovarian development, but the use of the key itself involves only simple observations and rapid execution of a squash from a piece of the ovary. The reproductive cycle of krill is divided into 10 stages: 8 stages for ovarian development leading to egg production, and 2 stages for sexual regression and reorganization after spawning periods. We believe that such a method could be useful for predicting spawning events and their timing for Antarctic krill, and for a better estimation of fecundity and related energy requirements. Similar keys devised for other euphausiids and free-spawning pelagic crustaceans will allow comparisons among different reproductive strategies.																	0278-0372					MAY	1991	11	2					236	249		10.2307/1548361							WOS:A1991FL24900005

Cephaloidophora pacifica was found at all stations around the Antarctic, with 96.4% of the euphausiids infected (n = 195). The numbers of C pacifica per krill ranged from 0 to 8089 krill(-1), and the average was 350.0 +/- 787.8 (mean +/- SD). The frequency distributions of C. pacifica showed an overdispersed parasite population (i.e. the variance was greater than the mean) at all locations. Statistical analysis showed that whilst the geographical location did not have a significant effect on intensity of C. pacifica the maturity stage of krill did, with an increasing intensity of infection as Krill matures. The infestation of E. superba by eugregarinid protozoan is considered to be a circum-Antarctic phenomenon, and it occurs equally throughout the Southern Ocean.

The acid value and free fatty acid content were constant when PRKO was stored at -20C, 4C and room temperature. The two values remained stable for 3 weeks, and then increased slowly when PRKO was stored at 40C. The peroxide value of PRKO stored at all conditions was constant during the 8-week storage. However, the thiobarbituric reactive substance of sample stored at most conditions showed a firstly increased and then decreased pattern. Meanwhile, after 8-week storage, the fatty acid composition of PRKO changed slightly, with a decrease in polyunsaturated fatty acids and an increase in saturated fatty acids. Furthermore, astaxanthin content of PRKO decreased when the sample was stored at 40C. Practical ApplicationsThese years, krill oil (KO) has captured increasing consumer interest and market share as an alternative source of omega-3 long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 LC-PUFA). Especially, most of the n-3 LC-PUFA in KO is incorporated into phospholipids (PL). Some studies showed that n-3 LC-PUFA in PL form had higher bioavailability than those in ethyl esters (EE) form and triglycerides (TG) form, giving a basis for developing a new type of commercial krill product using krill PL. The present study prepared a PL-rich KO (PRKO) through a supercritical carbon dioxide coupled to ethanol extraction procedure. The influences of storage temperature (-20C, 4C, room temperature and 40C), light and oxygen on stability of the PRKO with storage time up to 8 weeks were evaluated. Results of this research revealed that the PRKO had very good storage stability, which provides information for determining the storage conditions of krill PL.																	0145-8892	1745-4549				DEC	2016	40	6					1247	1255		10.1111/jfpp.12709							WOS:000390351000013

We present biomass estimates for 2 survey boxes, located over the shelf-break to the northeast and northwest of the island, derived from the first of these surveys conducted in January 1996. We contrast these with the most recent previous estimates for the region obtained in January 1994. Weighted mean krill density (and weighted variances) estimates for the 1996 surveys were 40.57 g m(-2) (13.37) and 26.48 g m(-2) (54.30) for the eastern and western boxes respectively These are high compared with those obtained in January 1994, when estimates for similar areas were 1.87 g m(-2) (0.14) and 7.43 g m(-2) (1.33) respectively. The greater than 20-fold difference between surveys reveals a very large interannual variability in krill abundance at South Georgia. In 1994 the low abundance resulted in greatly reduced breeding success in most habitual krill predator species there. In the 1996 season, however, breeding success of these species was normal. Instantaneous estimates of krill abundance using acoustic techniques are therefore consistent with measurements from predators, whose breeding performances provide a longer-term indication of prey abundance in the surrounding pelagic ecosystem in a particular season.

Antarctic krill peptide powder (AKPP) prepared from the tail meat by enzymatic hydrolysis significantly decreased the systolic blood pressure in spontaneously hypertensive rats by a single oral administration (1, 10, or 100 mg). Presumably, the effect of AKPP was through inhibition of the conversion of angiotensin, which mediates blood pressure elevation, from its inactive propeptide to the mature angiotensin. Two potent angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory peptides were isolated from AKPP by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and identified as Val-Trp (IC50 = 2.75 mu g/mL; 12.9 mu M) and Leu-Lys-Tyr (IC50 = 4.26 mu g/mL; 10.1 mu M). Val-Trp and Leu-Lys-Tyr comprised 0.025% +/- 0.0023% (w/w) and 0.018% +/- 0.0023% (w/w) of AKPP, respectively, as measured by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS). The contributions of Val-Trp and Leu-Lys-Tyr to the ACE inhibitor activity of AKPP were 17.7% +/- 1.60% and 8.04% +/- 1.03%, respectively, suggesting that these 2 peptides constitute a substantial portion of the overall ACE inhibitor potential of AKPP.																	0022-1147	1750-3841				MAY	2009	74	4					H116	H120		10.1111/j.1750-3841.2009.01138.x							WOS:000265937800031	19490329

Interannual differences were observed in zooplankton species composition, developmental stages, and abundances, which were linked to unusually high chlorophyll concentrations in the Bellingshausen Sea and Marguerite Bay during spring-summer 2000/2001. Copepod abundance was significantly higher in 2001 than in 2002 (46.3 and 28.3 ind m(-3) in 2001 and 2002, respectively). During 2001, the copepod community was dominated by two species. Calanoides acutus, a herbivore, and Metridia gerlachei, an omnivore, accounted for 46% and 45% of the community, respectively. During 2002, however, several species were relatively abundant, including M. gerlachei, Ctenocalanus spp., C acutus, Oithona spp., and Paraeuchaeta spp. Euphausiids also showed a rapid population response to high chlorophyll levels in 2001. Even though average total euphausiid (juvenile/adult) abundances were similar during both years (0.20 and 0.15 ind m(-3) for 2001 and 2002, respectively), species composition showed marked interannual differences due to varying life history strategies among species. Thysanoessa macrura, which has a relatively rapid development from larval to juvenile stages between spring and fall of the same year, was the most abundant euphausiid in 2001. In contrast, Euphausia crystallorophias and Euphausia superba juvenile/adult populations increased in 2002, owing to a slower development in which larval stages overwinter and recruit to juveniles during the following spring/summer. Other zooplankton groups those were abundant in Marguerite Bay, but showed little variability between years, included ostracods, pteropods, chaetognaths, medusae, amphipods, and mysids. Summer phytoplankton concentrations strongly influenced copepods and euphausiids; however, there were no clear associations between zooplankton distributions and fall environmental conditions (i.e., pigment concentrations and surface salinity) or bottom depth. It is notable that ostracods and pteropods had the highest abundances of non-copepod zooplankton. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

The aim of this experiment was to investigate the bioavailability of dietary fluoride from either krill shell or sodium fluoride (NaF) to rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss). The second aim was to investigate if the fluoride bioavailability was affected by adding calcium to the feed. Five experimental diets were produced; one control diet and four test diets containing 700 mg fluoride kg(-1) either from NaF or from krill shell, with or without added calcium chloride (15 g Ca kg(-1)). Triplicate groups of fish were given one meal in excess of appetite prior to sampling. Five fish from each replicate tank were terminally sampled for blood; 0, 1, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18,24, and 36 h postprandial. Fluoride in blood plasma was used as an indicator of fluoride absorption. Fish fed NaF showed a clear peak in plasma fluoride of 1.17 mg l(-1) 3 h postprandial, followed by a rapid decline. The fish fed krill shell did not obtain a clear peak but had a maximum fluoride plasma concentration (C(max)) of 0.32 mg l(-1) 3 h postprandial. The addition of dietary calcium reduced the fluoride uptake in fish fed the NaF diet by nearly 100%, while adding calcium to the diets with krill shell reduced the uptake of fluoride to nearly the half. To conclude, fluoride from krill shell had a lower bioavailability than fluoride from NaF. Dietary calcium was an efficient way to reduce the fluoride uptake of rainbow trout reared in fresh water.

External parasite infestation depends on moult-frequency and age in Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba)	POLAR BIOLOGY												Levels of infestation by the suctorian Ephelota sp. were determined in Antarctic krill taken in the north-eastern region of the Scotia sea, close to the island of South Georgia. Individuals caught in summer between 2002 and 2004 were measured for body length, eye diameter, moult stage, sex, sexual maturity and number of suctorian parasites. All krill samples were found to contain at least two modal size-classes and the complete range of maturity- and moult stages. Sample analysis for the different characters identified moult stage as an important determinant of infestation by Ephelota sp., with 66% of those about to moult (pre-moult individuals) being infested compared with 0% of post-moult individuals. Multiple Correspondence Analysis also identified a strong link between age and degree of suctorian infestation with large-eyed (and hence old) males having very high numbers of suctorian bodies. Moulting is costly in terms of energy and vulnerability, but it is believed that krill moult at relatively high rates throughout their life to facilitate growth and "shrinkage". Here, we demonstrate that the control of external parasitism is also a major advantage of moulting at high frequency. The capacity of krill to maintain a high moult rate decreases with age, leading to older krill enduring higher parasitic loads.																	0722-4060	1432-2056				JAN	2008	31	2					121	130		10.1007/s00300-007-0339-2							WOS:000251231000001

A new method was developed to extract and separate Antarctic krill PC. The PC was extracted only by acetone from Antarctic krill oil and separated by silica gel column chromatography mixtures of chloroform and methanol as eluting solvents. Thin-layer chromatography, high-performance liquid chromatography, and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy analyses were used to characterize the acetone-soluble Antarctic krill PC. The purity of the purified PC was able to reach 97.77 +/- A 0.65 %, which provided a reference basis for the preparation of standard Antarctic krill PC. Moreover, it was found in the fatty acid analysis that the purified PC contained mainly five fatty acids, including palmitic acid (41.25 %), oleic acid (8.62 %), 7-hexadecenoic acid (4.60 %), EPA (31.34 %), and DHA (14.52 %). The result is helpful for the analysis of Antarctic krill PC's molecular structures and the evaluation of its nutritional value.																	1438-2377	1438-2385				JUN	2014	238	6					1023	1028		10.1007/s00217-014-2178-z							WOS:000336269200013

Modelling Southern Ocean ecosystems: krill, the food-web, and the impacts of harvesting	BIOLOGICAL REVIEWS												The ecosystem approach to fisheries recognises the interdependence between harvested species and other ecosystem components. It alms to account for the propagation of the effects of harvesting through the food-web. The formulation and evaluation of ecosystem-based management strategies requires reliable models of ecosystem dynamics to predict these effects. The krill-based system in the Southern Ocean was the focus of some of the earliest models exploring such effects. It is also a suitable example for the development of models to support the ecosystem approach to fisheries because it ha a relatively simple food-web structure and progress has been made in developing models of the key species and interactions, some of which has been motivated by the need to develop ecosystem-based management. Antarctic krill, Euphausia superba, is the main target species for the fishery and the main prey of many top predators. It is therefore critical to capture the processes affecting the dynamics and distribution of krill in ecosystem dynamics models. These processes include environmental influences on recruitment and the spatially variable influence of advection. Models must also capture the interactions between krill and its consumers, which are mediated by the spatial structure of the environment. Various models have explored predator-prey population dynamics with simplistic representations of these interactions, while others have focused on specific details of the interactions. There is now a pressing need to develop plausible and practical models of ecosystem dynamics that link processes occurring at these different scales. Many studies have highlighted uncertainties in our understanding of the system, which indicates future priorities in terms of both data collection and developing methods to evaluate the effects of these uncertainties on model predictions. We propose a modelling approach that focuses on harvested species and their monitored consumers and that evaluates model uncertainty by using alternative structures and functional forms in a Monte Carlo framework.

However, it is not acceptable for direct consumption as traditional food, as its high content of fluoride is harmful to adults and children. Therefore, the safety of fluoride residue in Antarctic krill for food production should be investigated. In this research, the fluoride toxicity in Antarctic Krill was evaluated through mice feeding experiment. Their body weight was found not to be influenced by fluoride. However, dental fluorosis was observed in the krill group and the NaF group. Fluoride content in liver, kidney, urine, and bones are significantly different (P<0.05) among these three groups, which amount to plateau during the first ten days of feeding, except the fluoride in bone which keeps increasing all through the experimental time. Furthermore, less amount of fluoride was determined in the krill group compared with the amount in NaF group, even if they have the same concentration of fluoride. Besides, lesions in livers, kidneys and bones of the two experimental groups were observed through histopathological studies.

Stomach contents from 2239 C. gunnari (130-560 mm total length) were examined. A bootstrapping technique was used to calculate confidence intervals for an index of relative importance of prey categories (% IRIDC). Diet varied significantly between years and age classes but there was little regional difference in diet. In general, diet was dominated by krill, Euphausia superba and by the amphipod Themisto gaudichaudii. Smaller (younger) fish tended to prey on a higher proportion of T. gaudichaudii and small euphausiids such as Thysanoessa sp. and took smaller quantities of E. superba. In a season of poor krill availability (summer of 2003-2004) the proportion of krill in the diet, stomach fullness and fish condition (indicated by length-weight relationships) were significantly lower than in the other summer seasons. A large reduction (> 80%) in the estimated annual (2005) biomass of the C. gunnari stock directly followed the season of poor krill availability. This decline was largely because of mortality of 2+ and 3+ fish, which were more krill dependent than 1+ fish. Younger fish appear to have survived, leading to an increase in the estimated population biomass in 2006.				, Martin/ABE-6728-2020; Collins, Martin A/J-8560-2017													0722-4060	1432-2056				APR	2009	32	4					569	581		10.1007/s00300-008-0552-7							WOS:000264328700006						
J	Richerson, K; Driscoll, R; Mangel, M				Richerson, Kate; Driscoll, Ryan; Mangel, Marc			Increasing temperature may shift availability of euphausiid prey in the Southern Ocean	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												Climate change is predicted to affect Southern Ocean biota in complex ways. Euphausiids play a crucial role in the trophodynamics of the ecosystem, and their status under future environmental scenarios is the subject of much concern. Thysanoessa macrura is the most widely distributed, numerically abundant, and ubiquitous euphausiid south of the Polar Front and may be an underappreciated prey species. T. macrura is eurythermic and may be better able to tolerate warming ocean temperatures in comparison to the more stenothermic Antarctic krill Euphausia superba. We use temperature-dependent growth models and biomass per recruit to investigate how the availability of this euphausiid to predators may change under a range of temperature scenarios. We contrast this with the availability of E. superba and find that, under some ranges of temperature change, increasing T. macrura growth may be able to partially compensate for decreasing E. superba growth in terms of biomass available for predators. However, in spite of its considerable biomass, other aspects of this species, such as its size and habitat, may limit its potential to replace E. superba in the diet of many predators.																	0171-8630	1616-1599				FEB 8	2018	588						59	70		10.3354/meps12460							WOS:000426258100005

S.; Clark, Melody S.; Gaten, Edward; Rosato, Ezio			Effects of simulated light regimes on gene expression in Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba Dana)	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY												A change in photoperiod has been implicated in triggering a transition from an active to a quiescent state in Antarctic krill. We examined this process at the molecular level, to identify processes that are affected when passing a photoperiodic threshold. Antarctic krill captured in the austral autumn were divided into two groups and immediately incubated either under a photoperiod of 12 h light:12 h darkness (LID), simulating the natural light cycle, or in continuous darkness (DID), simulating winter. All other conditions were kept identical between incubations. After 7 days of adaptation, krill were sampled every 4h over a 24h period and frozen. Total RNA was extracted from the heads and pooled to construct a suppression subtractive hybridisation library. Differentially expressed sequences were identified and annotated into functional categories through database sequence matching. We found a difference in gene expression between LD and DD krill, with LID krill expressing more genes involved in functions such as metabolism, motor activity, protein binding and various other cellular activities. Eleven of these genes were examined further with quantitative polymerase chain reaction analyses, which revealed that expression levels were significantly higher in LD krill. The genes affected by simulated photoperiodic change are consistent with known features of quiescence, such as a slowing of moult rate, a lowering of activity levels and a reduction in metabolic rate. The expression of proteases involved in apolysis, where the old cuticle separates from the epidermis, showed particular sensitivity to photoperiod and point to the mechanism by which moult rate is adjusted seasonally. Our results show that key processes are already responding at the molecular level after just 7 days of exposure to a changed photoperiodic cycle.

Horizontal and vertical distribution of euphausiid species on the Western Antarctic Peninsula U.S. GLOBEC Southern Ocean study site	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY												The Western Antarctic Peninsula (WAP) is a site of high krill abundance and a likely source region for krill populations found to the north and east of the area. The U.S. GLOBEC Southern Ocean program studied factors that contribute to the overwintering success of krill in the region of Marguerite Bay, WAP. A MOCNESS net system was used to sample the vertical distribution and abundance of zooplankton relative to physical features (hydrography and circulation) during four broad-scale survey cruises in the fall and winter of 2001 and 2002. Four species were found throughout the study area on all four cruises: Euphausia superba, Euphausia crystallorophias. Euphausia triacantha, and Thysanoessa macrura. The species had significantly different horizontal and vertical distributions. Both E. superba and T. macrura were broadly distributed throughout the area, but the central 50% of their vertical distributions were distinct with E. superba most abundant in the upper 100 m in the coldest, freshest water (average temperature and salinity: -1.13 degrees C; 33.80) and T. macrura occurring between 100 and 250 m (at 0.01 degrees C; 34.228). E. crystailorophias had a more coastal distribution and was usually found deeper in slightly warmer and saltier water (-0.44 degrees C; 33.9982) than E. superba and either overlapped or was above T. macrura in depth. E. triacantha was much rarer and sporadically distributed in the study area and was found substantially deeper (center of distribution about 300 m) in the warmest saltiest water (1.40 degrees C; 34.65) than the other three euphausiid species. Larval distributions for E. superba indicated that at least some proportion of the populations resulted from reproduction and development on the continental shelf, and not solely from offshore reproduction and transport onto the shelf. A neutral particle tracking model was used to gain insight into the relative importance of shelf versus off-shelf origins for the larvae. The results suggest that a combination of offshore and onshore reproduction can account for the observed E. superba larval distributions in the U.S. SO GLOBEC study site. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Crustaceans ranked first by number (98 %) and second by reconstituted mass (37 %). The hyperiid Themisto gaudichaudii and the euphausiid Thysanoessa sp. were the dominant prey items, accounting each for 42 % by number, and for 12 and 4 % by mass of the diet, respectively, Other important crustacean prey were the Antarctic krill Euphausia superba (2% by number and 10% by mass) and the large shrimp Pasiphaea scotiae (<1 and 5 %, respectively). Fish were minor items by number (<1%) but, owing to their large size, they dominated the diet by reconstituted mass (57 %), Mesopelagic fish of the families Myctophidae (14 % by mass) and Melamphaidae (12 %) were the main fish prey together with the gempylid Paradiplospinus gracilis (19 %). Adult blue petrels use a 2-fold foraging strategy, performing short trips (ST, 2 d on average) and long trips (LT, 7 d) during the chick-rearing period, Birds fed more on T gaudichaudii during ST and more on Thysanoessa sp, during LT. The subantarctic krill Euphausia vallentini were found in ST samples, and Antarctic krill and stomach oil were found in LT samples. Biogeography of the prey shows that blue petrels fed in a wide variety of marine habitats, During ST, they foraged in the kelp belt and over the shelf, but favoured oceanic waters in the vicinity of the archipelago. During LT, the occurrence of Antarctic krill indicates feeding in southern Antarctic waters, > 1000 km from the breeding colonies, but blue petrels also foraged on their way back to Iles Kerguelen from these distant foraging grounds to feed their chicks. A comparison of the stable carbon and nitrogen isotopic compositions of chick and adult feathers reveals that adult blue petrels fed at the same trophic level during the chick-rearing and moulting period, and that they renew their flight feathers in Antarctic waters.

A response surface design was used to obtain the best SDE extraction parameters. The optimum extraction efficiency of 93.77 +/- 0.92% was obtained at a stirring speed of 1030 rpm, temperature of 47 degrees C and dynamic extraction time of 90 min. Compared with n-hexane, ethanol, supercritical CO2 and subcritical n-butane extraction, the krill oil extracted by SDE exhibited low peroxide values (1.46 +/- 0.26 mmol kg(-1)), high astaxanthin (218.06 +/- 4.74 mg kg(-1)), phosphatidylcholine (PC) (33.95 +/- 0.65%), and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) (11.67 +/- 0.23%) content. Moreover, krill oil extracted by SDE has high levels of EPA (16.38 +/- 0.05%) and DHA (7.91 +/- 0.07%). SDE extraction proved to be an efficient and safe method for extraction of quality krill oil from wet Antarctic krill, and it could be a promising method for oil extraction in wet food in future.

Additionally, the influence of fatty acid composition on AST degradation in the three types of KO was compared. The results revealed that the degradation of AST followed first-order kinetics, and the temperature dependence of the reaction was well explained by the Arrhenius relationship. A high storage temperature led to faster AST degradation. AST degradation rates under nitrogen were lower than those under an oxygen atmosphere. The higher degradation rate of AST in PKO is ascribed to its higher level of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) in comparison to WKO and TKO. This is the first time the energy of activation of AST degradation was evaluated to determine how the fatty acid composition of the oil matrix and storage atmosphere affect the reaction kinetics.																	0003-021X	1558-9331				SEP	2018	95	9					1171	1178		10.1002/aocs.12129							WOS:000443231900005

Two bacterial cultures were isolated and tested for the degradation of krill shell waste. According to the morphological examination, physiological tests, and applied molecular techniques conducted, isolates were identified as Bacillus subtilis and Lactobacillus plantarum. At a temperature of 37 degrees C, both strains were cultivated separately in flasks containing krill shell waste. At determined periods of time, deproteinization and demineralization of residuals were measured. For deproteinization tests, the liquid phase fermentation of krill shell waste showed protein removal of 88.9% after 60 h. For demineralization tests, the liquid phase fermentation of krill shell waste showed calcium carbonate removal of 84.6% after 72 h. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) analysis of chitin prepared by the process was carried out and compared with spectra of samples treated by strong acids and bases.																	1049-8850	1547-0636					2017	26	10					1210	1220		10.1080/10498850.2015.1094686							WOS:000419358200011

Life Cycle Environmental Impacts of Three Products Derived from Wild-Caught Antarctic Krill (Euphausia superba)	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Concern has been voiced in recent years regarding the environmental implications of the Antarctic krill fishery. Attention has focused primarily on ecological concerns, whereas other environmental aspects, including potentially globally problematic emissions and material and energy demands, have not been examined in detail. Here we apply life cycle assessment to measure the contributions of krill meal, oil, and omega-3 capsules to global warming, ozone depletion, acidification, eutrophication, energy use, and biotic resource use. Supply chains of one krill fishing and processing company, Aker BioMarine of Norway, were assessed. Impacts of krill products were found to be driven primarily by the combustion of fossil fuels onboard the fishing vessel and a transport/resupply vessel. Approximately 190 L of fuel are burned per tonne of raw krill landed, markedly higher than fuel inputs to reduction fisheries targeting other species. In contrast, the biotic resource use associated with extracting krill is relatively low compared to that of other reduction fisheries. Results of this study provide insight into the broader environmental implications of the krill fishery, comparisons between products derived from krill and other species targeted for reduction, opportunities for improving the fishery's performance, and a baseline against which to measure future performance.

Spatial heterogeneity in the timing of ice melt generates temporal variability in the development of these events across the habitat, offering a natural framework to assess how foraging marine predators respond to the spring phenology. We combined 4 yr of tracking data of Antarctic petrels Thalassoica antarctica with synoptic remote-sensing data on sea ice and chlorophyll a to test how the development of melting ice and primary production drive Antarctic petrel foraging. Cross-correlation analyses of first-passage time revealed that Antarctic petrels utilized foraging areas with a spatial scale of 300 km. These areas changed position or disappeared within 10 to 30 d and showed no spatial consistency among years. Generalized additive model (GAM) analyses suggested that the presence of foraging areas was related to the time since ice melt. Antarctic petrels concentrated their search effort in melting areas and in areas that had reached an age of 50 to 60 d from the date of ice melt. We found no significant relationship between search effort and chlorophyll a concentration. We suggest that these foraging patterns were related to the vertical distribution and profitability of the main prey, the Antarctic krill Euphausia superba. Our study demonstrates that the annual ice melt in the Southern Ocean shapes the development of a highly patchy and elusive food web, underscoring the importance of flexible foraging strategies among top predators.

Four different pretreatment methods were used for the extraction of fluoride: double-deionised water extraction, sulphuric acid distillation, hydrochloric acid extraction, and pH adjustment with buffer after hydrochloric acid extraction. Four methods of comparative analysis revealed that sulphuric acid distillation was suitable preparation for ion chromatography determination of fluoride in Antarctic krill (fluoride content 288.7 +/- 10.2 mg/kg). The method was partially validated in linearity, accuracy, and precision. The linear range was from 0.1 to 10.0 mg/l with the regression coefficient of 0.99998. The accuracy expressed as the recoveries of standard addition ranged from 95.3% to 101.3%, the relative standard deviation (n = 8) was 1.8-1.9%. With this method, the 3 sigma limit of detection was 0.06 mg/l of fluoride in Antarctic krill. Our results indicate that the method (limit of quantification 0.2 mg/l) could be well applied for the determination of fluoride in Antarctic krill.

Krill oil is being developed for the health. food and dietary supplement because it possesses of omega. 3 fatty acids and phospholipid. derived fatty acids; however, it was limited due to its multiple arsenic species residues. Here, we presented a high performance liquid chromatography. inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometric (HPLC-ICP-MS) method for the simultaneous, sensitive, and rapid quantification of five arsenic metabolites including organic and inorganic forms, then the method was applied to the analysis of arsenic species in krill oil. The analytes were separated on a hydroxide-selective anion. exchange column with sodium carbonate (38 mmol/L) and sodium acetate (15 mmol/L) as mobile phase at a flow rate of 0.6 mL/min for 15 min. Arsenic analytes were monitored with a triple quadrupole ICP mass spectrometer. Validation revealed that the method had a linear range from 0.5 to 500 mu g/L with R > 0. 9993. The LOD was 0.1-0.2 mu g/L and LOQ was 1.5-2.6 mu g/L with RSD< 5%. The standard addition method displayed a recovery range from 88.9% to 106.3%. Application of the method to arsenic species analysis in krill oil indicated that krill oil was a safe food or diet supplement.																	0253-3820	1872-2040				MAY	2016	44	5					767	772		10.11895/j.issn.0253.3820.150942							WOS:000378354200010

To test this hypothesis, we grew cultures of Phaeocystis antarctica that had been grown under either photosynthetically active radiation (PAR, 400-750 nm) plus UV irradiation (UVR, 280-400 nm), or else PAR-only. Algae grown under PAR-only produced high concentrations of porphyra-334, whereas additional UVR caused formation of high concentrations of mycosporine-glycine:valine and lower concentrations of porphyra-334. Krill were fed with either of these two cultures on eight occasions over 63 days. A third group was starved for the duration of the experiment. Animals were analysed after 36 and 63 days for MAA content. Remaining animals from all treatments were starved for a further 35 days and analysed to examine MAA retention characteristics. Our findings are that krill acquired different MAAs from dietary algae depending on the light conditions under which the algae were grown. Specifically, krill fed algae grown under PAR-only had higher concentrations of porphyra-334 than starved krill. Conversely, krill fed algae grown under PAR with additional WR had high body concentrations of mycosporine-glycine :valine. MAA concentrations in starved krill remained static throughout the experiment. However, long term starvation (35 days) caused levels of certain acquired MAAs to decline. From this we can infer that MAA concentrations in krill are dependent on the MAA content of phytoplankton, and therefore the algae's response to UV exposure. This has implications for transfer of MAAs through marine trophic webs. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science BN. All rights reserved.

T gaudichaudii occurred in high densities (up to 61 individuals m(-3)) in the water column, being more abundant within islands in the western part of the gulf than at open gulf and shelf stations. The amphipod was a major prey of all seabird species investigated except the South Georgian diving petrel, accounting for 39, 80, 68, 59 and 46% of the total number of prey of blue petrels, thin-billed prions, Antarctic prions, common diving petrels and southern rockhopper penguins, respectively. The length-frequency distribution of T gaudichaudii was similar between the 2 diving species, which fed on 1 large size class of adult individuals, whereas the 3 surface-feeding seabirds preyed upon 2 size classes but in different proportions. Juveniles and adults T gaudichaudii were equally important in the diet of blue petrels, whereas juveniles and adults predominated in the food of thin-billed and Antarctic prions, respectively. Comparison of T gaudichaudii found in nets and food samples together with observations at sea indicated that common diving petrels and southern rockhopper penguins fed in the close vicinity of the colonies in the Golfe du Morbihan, whereas blue petrels, and thin-billed and Antarctic prions mainly preyed upon amphipods outside the sampled area. Our study shows that T.gaudichaudii an important local component of the macrozooplankton community and the main prey for planktivorous seabirds inhabiting the Kerguelen archipelago. In certain areas of the subantarctic zone, it therefore has a trophic role similar to that of Antarctic krill Euphausia superba further south, in Antarctic waters.																	0171-8630						2001	223						261	276		10.3354/meps223261							WOS:000173348700023

Protein from Northern krill (Thysanoessa inermis), Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) and the Arctic amphipod (Themisto libellula) can partially replace fish meal in diets to Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) without affecting product quality	AQUACULTURE NUTRITION												The main objective of the present study was to evaluate the effect of using three different crustacean meals (Tysanoessa inermis, Euphausia superba, Themisto libellula) on product quality of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.). In order to do this, a total of six iso-protein, iso-lipid and iso-carotenoid diets were prepared. Two experimental diet series were prepared. In the first series, a control feed (K0) was compared with diets where 20%, 40% and 60% of the fish meal protein were replaced with protein from Northern krill T. inermis (K20, K40 and K60, respectively). In the second series, control feed (K0) was compared with diets where 40% of the dietary protein was replaced by protein from T. inermis (K40), Antarctic krill E. superba (AK40) and the Arctic amphipod T. libellula (AMP40). The salmon groups were fed the various diets for 160 days and the average weight of the fish increased from 410 g to around 1500 g. Fish given diets containing krill displayed a general better growth compared with the ones given pure fish meal diet. Replacing fish meal protein with protein from the crustacean sources had, in general, only minor effects on the flesh quality measured both by technical and sensory methods. However, some significant effects were noted. Postmortem muscle pH was generally lower (P < 0.05), for K20, K40, AMP40 in fish fed crustacean diets compared with those receiving the control diet. Increasing the replacement level of non-fish meal protein from Northern krill (K20, K60) significantly reduced the rigor contraction. Fish given K20 had a slightly firmer meat texture, measured as resistance to post-rigor compression, especially when compared with K60 (P < 0.05). Fish from the K20 and AMP40 groups had a deeper red flesh coloration [both light reflection (A*-value and chroma) and flesh astaxanthin concentration] than fish fed K0 and higher inclusions of krill meal. The groups with the highest astaxanthin flesh content also showed the best growth and had the highest feed intake. Finally, a sensory panel analysis differed slightly from the technical measurements in that K0, rather than K20 was given the highest score for hardness and colour. In comparison with K0, AK40 got the lowest salty taste and hardness scores from the panellists relative to the control fish (P < 0.05). Despite minor effects on the present quality measures, it is concluded that meal from three different crustacean species can successfully replace fish meal up to 60% with Northern krill, and 40% of Antarctic krill and amphipod meal of dietary proteins.

In this study, iron -binding peptides were isolated from Antarctic krill using enzymatic (trypsin) hydrolysis and im- mobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC); the binding mode and surface morphology of Antarctic krill peptides (AKP)-iron complexes as well as their iron delivery behavior in the gastrointestinal tract were in-vestigated. Results showed that the AKP bound 79.3% of available iron from the enzymatic hydrolysis for 180 min. The contents of negatively-charged amino acids (Asp and Glu) on the AKP showed a positive corre-lation (r = 0.80) with iron-binding activities (the data includes Asn and Gln), while positively-charged amino acids showed a negative correlation (r = -0.83). Moreover, His, Ser and Thr on the AKP were also involved in the iron-binding activities. Iron-binding peptides from Antarctic krill hydrolysates, isolated using IMAC-Fe3+ and identified using HPLC-MS/MS, showed a mass of 712-2451 Da, and were enriched in Asp (Asn), Glu (Gln), His, Ser or Thr. The iron ions mainly bound to carboxyl groups of AKP, thus forming nano-scale, spherical particles. The iron nanocarriers formed by AKP showed a significant iron transport activity after simulated gastrointestinal digestion, as compared to FeSO 4 (P < 0.05). The results suggested that the AKP-iron nano - composite has the potential to be a nutraceutical supplement for improving iron absorption.																	2212-4292	2212-4306				AUG	2020	36								100657	10.1016/j.fbio.2020.100657							WOS:000549901100005

In this study, the use of high-intensity ultrasound for the preparation of low oil emulsion gel (oil fraction of 0.25) was investigated. Specifically, defatted Antarctic krill protein (dAKP) was used to stabilize the interface of soybean oil and water. Then, the microstructure and the stabilization mechanism of the formed emulsion gel were evaluated by cryoSEM, CLSM, zeta potential, rheological measurements, and FTIR. Besides, the particle diameter was measured to be around 5 mu m. The results of CLSM indicated that the emulsion gel was the oil-in-water type. The emulsion gel exhibited gel-like viscoelastic behavior even at a low concentration of dAKP due to the formation of a rigid particle network while the rheological behavior of the emulsion gel was significantly affected by the concentration of dAKP. The stabilization of the emulsion gel can be maintained by space steric hindrance and hydrophobic interactions between particles in the emulsion gel system.																	1350-4177	1873-2828				JAN	2021	70								105294	10.1016/j.ultsonch.2020.105294							WOS:000595254400004	32759019

A 56% FM-based diet was regarded as a high FM inclusion diet (HFM), and a low-FM diet (LFM) was prepared by replacing 50% FM from the HFM. Four other diets were prepared by supplementing 3%, 6%, 9% and 12% KM into the LFM diet gradually replacing soy protein concentrate and tankage meal (designated as KM3, KM6, KM9 and KM12 respectively). Quadruplicate groups of fish were fed one of the diets for 12 weeks. The growth performance and feed utilization efficiency were improved by the dietary KM supplementation. Digestibility of dietary protein and dry matter was increased by the KM3-9 diets. Haematocrit and haemoglobin were increased by KM supplementation. The innate immunity and antioxidant capacity assessed by Ig, antiprotease, lysozyme, GPx and SOD and the condition factor of fish were significantly increased by KM3-9 diets. Moreover, goblet cell counts, villi length and fillet yield of fish were significantly improved by all the KM-containing diets (KM3-12). A 25-day-long challenge test with the Edwardsiella tarda pathogen showed that the cumulative mortality was higher in fish fed the LFM diet than in fish fed the HFM or KM-supplemented diets. The results indicate that dietary KM supplementation in a LFM diet can increase growth performance and feed utilization efficiency, diet digestibility, intestinal development and functions, innate immunity and disease resistance of olive flounder. The recommended level of KM inclusion in a LFM diet seems to be 6.6% according to quadratic regression analysis.

Each enzyme showed a single protein band (30000 Daltons) in sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gradient gel electrophoresis indicating high purity and identical molecular weights. Moreover, each enzyme demonstrated one inmunoprecipitate on crossed immunoelectrophoresis (two-dimensional agarose gel electrophoresis) using polyclonal rabbit antibodies which confirmed the high purity of the individual enzymes. A mixture of the three enzymes (I, II, III) revealed two immunoprecipitates. not one or three which should have been the case for identical or nonidentical immunological properties. Double immunodiffusion test according to Ouchterlony exhibited immunological identity between enzyme II and III. Enzyme I showed only partial identity with II III. These findings correlated well with biochemical data on the three serine proteinases. Enzyme I is able to liberate free amino acids from polypeptides in comparison with enzyme II and III (classical true endopeptidases), which do not. We suggest that these unique biochemical properties also have their immunological counterpart expressed as other antigenic determinants of the molecular structure.																	0722-4060	1432-2056				DEC	1991	11	7					495	500									WOS:A1991GU47800010

The content of glycerol was 1.3725 +/- 0.218 mg/g in freeze-dried Antarctic krill. The structure of glycerol in the Antarctic krill was subsequently determined by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) which verified the presence of the material in the krill. The HPTLC method exhibited excellent accuracy with a recovery of 90.1-103.3% and good precision with a relative standard deviation (RSD) of 1.59-4.84%. The results clearly exhibited the applicability of the proposed for quantifying glycerol in Antarctic krill.																	1233-2356	2083-5736				DEC	2018	30	4					274	277		10.1556/1326.2017.00298							WOS:000450760400012

Dynamic histological analysis on days 11, 24, and 35 postsurgery showed that PP-AKP promoted hypertrophy and mineralization of cartilage callus, formation of new bone tissue, and remodeling of boney callus. Biomechanical property tests on day 35 postsurgery demonstrated that PP-AKP significantly improved callus stiffness. Real-time PCR analysis showed that on day 11 postsurgery, PP-AKP significantly decreased mRNA expression of aggrecan and collagen type X (Col10a), and increased vascular endothelial growth factor level, suggesting that it promoted chondrocytes hypertrophy and vascular invasion. On day 24 postsurgery, PP-AKP significantly decreased matrix metalloproteinase 13 expression, and increased expression of collagen type I and bone gla protein, suggesting that it promoted cartilage matrix degradation and new bone formation. Practical applicationsAs a novel food material, Antarctic Krill possesses an enormous biomass (0.65-1 billion tons) and utilization potential. It has the largest amount of protein among reported organisms worldwide with better biological value than other animal proteins. This study demonstrated that phosphorylated peptides from Antarctic Krill could promote osteoporotic fracture healing on ovariectomized mice by facilitating endochondral ossification, which may provide theoretical basis for use of Antarctic Krill protein as bone protective functional food in future.																	0145-8884	1745-4514				DEC	2017	41	6							e12408	10.1111/jfbc.12408							WOS:000417120500007						
J	Jansen, JK; Boveng, PL; Bengtson, JL				Jansen, JK; Boveng, PL; Bengtson, JL			Foraging modes of chinstrap penguins: contrasts between day and night	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												Penguins rely on vision to travel and hunt at sea. Vision in marine predators, particularly those hunting phototactic prey under a broad range of light intensities, must be better understood to realize how these species respond to changes in their environment. We studied the effects of daily cycles in light intensity on visual predators by examining the duration and timing of chinstrap penguins' Pygoscelis antarctica foraging trips and the size, composition, and timing of their meals. We used radio telemetry and stomach-contents sampling to study adult penguins that were provisioning chicks during the summers of 1993 and 1994 at Seal Island, Antarctica. The penguins rarely initiated or terminated foraging trips at night, but otherwise varied the timing and duration of trips to sea. Cluster analyses using departure and arrival times revealed 5 distinct modes of foraging: 3 were strictly diurnal (early, mid-, and late) and 2 were partly nocturnal (overnight and extended). Durations of diurnal trips (4 to 11 h) were shorter than overnight (13 to 14 h) and extended trips (18 to 22 h). Early and mid-diurnal trips and extended trips were significantly shorter in 1993 than in 1994; late diurnal and overnight trip durations did not differ between years. Diurnal foraging was most common in 1993, whereas overnight foraging predominated in 1994. Shortened diurnal foraging in 1993 appears to have increased the frequency of diurnal foraging by allowing more parent birds to alternate diurnal trips within a single day and by reducing the incidence of birds extending diurnal foraging through the night. That penguins foraged more frequently by day when permitted by shorter trip durations tin 1993) suggests that they opted to forage diurnally whenever possible. Returning diurnal and overnight foragers had greater than 99 and 74% Antarctic krill Euphausia superba by weight in their stomachs, respectively. However, overnight foragers also returned with significant amounts of highly digested remains of pelagic fish, suggesting birds were in offshore waters taking fish during the night. In contrast, only 1 out of 40 diurnal foragers from both years combined had evidence of fish. Thus, the daily light cycle affected both the timing and duration of chinstrap penguin foraging as well as the type of prey consumed during trips to sea.																	0171-8630						1998	165						161	172		10.3354/meps165161							WOS:000073828700014

A.			The Application of Optical Coherence Tomography to Image Subsurface Tissue Structure of Antarctic Krill Euphausia superba	PLOS ONE												Many small open ocean animals, such as Antarctic krill, are an important part of marine ecosystems. To discover what will happen to animals such as krill in a changing ocean, experiments are run in aquaria where conditions can be controlled to simulate water characteristics predicted to occur in the future. The response of individual animals to changing water conditions can be hard to observe, and with current observation techniques it is very difficult to follow the progress of an individual animal through its life. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is an optical imaging technique that allows images at high resolution to be obtained from depths up to a few millimeters inside biological specimens. It is compatible with in vivo imaging and can be used repeatedly on the same specimens. In this work, we show how OCT may be applied to post mortem krill samples and how important physiological data such as shell thickness and estimates of organ volume can be obtained. Using OCT we find an average value for the thickness of krill exoskeleton to be (30 +/- 4) mu m along a 1 cm length of the animal body. We also show that the technique may be used to provide detailed imagery of the internal structure of a pleopod joint and provide an estimate for the heart volume of (0.73 +/- 0.03) mm(3).

POLAR BIOLOGY												This study presents data on krill demography west of the Antarctic Peninsula covering many years since 1982. The recruitment indices are compared with those for other mesoscale study regions collected over the last 25 years. We use these data to investigate whether results from such mesoscale surveys are representative of large-scale stocks or regional populations. Generally, the proportional recruitment indices for 1- (R-1) and 2-year-old (R-2) krill differ substantially between years for a given area. However, indices were in conformity with the results from other regional scientific surveys. Recruitment indices showed a significant correlation for age-class 1 krill between scientific surveys from the northern Bellingshausen Sea, the Elephant Island area and South Georgia. The correlation becomes weaker for R-2 recruitment indices. There was no correlation between krill recruitment indices from Atlantic and Indian Ocean survey sites. Problems of single-year outliers from Elephant Island are discussed, as well as the problem of 'undersized' length classes of the age-1 group that occur in the samples of some years.																	0722-4060					OCT	2003	26	10					672	679		10.1007/s00300-003-0537-5							WOS:000185917700007

J	Brierley, AS; Watkins, JL				Brierley, AS; Watkins, JL			Acoustic targets at South Georgia and the South Orkney islands during a season of krill scarcity	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												Dual frequency (38 and 120 kHz) acoustic surveys of shelf-break regions in the vicinity of the Willis Islands, South Georgia, and Coronation Island, South Orkneys, both in the Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean, were carried out from RRS 'James Clark Ross' during January 1994. The difference in echo signal strength between the 2 frequencies [delta MVBS (mean volume backscattering strength) = MVBS 120 kHz - MVBS 38 kHz] was used to partition acoustic targets into 3 biological categories: Antarctic krill Euphausia superba, nekton (larger than krill) and zooplankton (smaller than krill). Krill density estimates were derived for both survey areas, and the relative contribution of each class of target to overall regional pelagic biomass determined. Krill distribution in both regions was extremely patchy, resulting in a highly skewed frequency distribution of density; for example one echo-integration interval contained 10(4) times the mean krill density. An approximate B-fold difference in mean krill abundance was detected between the 2 areas but, in comparison with previously published density estimates, krill densities in both regions were extremely low (1.7 and 10.7 gm(-2) for Willis and Coronation Islands respectively). Gross regional differences in pelagic faunal composition were apparent ent from inspection of echo charts, and were quantified by detailed analysis of acoustic signals. The water column in the vicinity of the Willis Islands was characterised by a series of diffuse but continuous scattering layers visible only at 120 kHz, and 73% by mass of acoustic targets in this region were classified as zooplankton. In marked contrast, the Coronation Island region was dominated by dense, discrete acoustic target patches which were classified as larger, nektonic, sound scatterers (fish or squid), and only 12% of targets there were classified as zooplankton. Elsewhere, data from predator diet analyses carried out at Bird Island, South Georgia, during the same season that our acoustic measurements were made, confirm the profoundly low levels of krill availability there and support the acoustic observation that the Willis Islands region contained large numbers of small zooplankton such as the amphipod Themisto gaudichaudii. Similarly, available data on analyses of stomach contents of Chinstrap penguins nesting in a neighbouring region within an oceanographic setting similar to that of Coronation Island reveal the presence of more fish in the diet than usual. Conclusions drawn from acoustic observations as to the relative regional composition of pelagic biomass are therefore clearly supported by independent evidence gathered from predators, and the value of integrating predator/prey and acoustic studies to characterise the content of localised marine ecosystems is demonstrated.

XRD results showed that the major phase in AAKI was ascribed to apatite. Besides, it was noticed that the (300) peak of AAKI shifted to 33.07 degrees, which was coincident with that of fluorapatite (FA). The FTIR results confirmed the presence of phosphate ions, and the absence of -OH. The EDS results confirmed the presence of Ca, P, O and F elements in the ash sample. The content of FA in the ash was determined to be 50.4%, and the proportion of fluorine in the form of FA to the total fluorine in the integument was 40.5%. Based on the XRD, FTIR and EDS results, it can be concluded that FA was the main form of fluoride in the integument of Antarctic krill.																	2045-2322					MAY 27	2019	9								7853	10.1038/s41598-019-44337-6							WOS:000469011800001	31133736

FITTING EUPHAUSIA SUPERBA INTO SOUTHERN OCEAN FOOD-WEB MODELS: A REVIEW OF DATA SOURCES AND THEIR LIMITATIONS	CCAMLR SCIENCE												This paper aims to provide the overview needed to include krill in food-web models and to guide modellers to key sources of data. It describes the strengths of each method of sampling krill, i.e. with nets (for historical time series, demographic information and live krill), acoustics (distribution, time series, biomass and swarm-scale information), the fishery (sustained sampling in one place and wide area and time coverage) and via predators (long time series, demographic indices). Each data source has caveats and more efforts to combine them are recommended. Observations that krill occupy the under-ice layer, the 0-10 m layer, the deeper water column and the benthos have fundamental implications, both for assessing biomass and for modelling the food web. Temporally, the intense (order of magnitude) interannual variability in krill population size within the southwest (SW) Atlantic sector is a major scale of variability, driven by sea-ice and climate effects on recruitment. This variability masks top-down predation controls that may operate over multi-decadal scales. Growth in spring, summer and autumn is now fairly well quantified, but mortality remains an enigma. We are still not yet confident which are the major predators of krill but studies increasingly suggest that they are not currently birds or mammals. Krill feed across three trophic levels and can control food populations through locally high grazing impact and nutrient regeneration. They also have fundamental regional differences in overwintering strategies, on-shelf/off-shelf distributions, relationships with sea-ice and diet. Whether this reflects 'subpopulations' with regionally specific life cycles is still unclear. However, caution is urged when scaling-up food-web models and their parameterisations, either from individual to schooling krill, or from one region to another.

In this study, 1-octacosanol was extracted from Antarctic krill for the first time. Separation of 1-octacosanol was achieved using high-performance thin-layer chromatography (TLC) with a mobile phase consisting of petroleum ether/ethyl acetate/toluene (4 : 1 : 0.05, v/v/v) on precoated silica gel GF(254) high-performance TLC plates. The separated 1-octacosanol was quantified using spectrodensitometry with distilled water/bromothymol blue/sodium hydroxide (100 : 0.1 : 0.7, v/w/w) as a chromogenic system. The high-performance TLC method was validated with respect to specificity, linearity, intra-and interplate variation. The stability of the 1-octacosanol-chromogen complex and recovery of 1-octacosanol were also evaluated. Containing similar to 10.6 mg/mg 1-octacosanol, Antarctic krill is potentially a rich and renewable source of 1-octacosanol.																	0021-9665	1945-239X				MAY-JUN	2015	53	5					811	815		10.1093/chromsci/bmu098							WOS:000360833600025	25146498

Impacts on phytoplankton dynamics by free-drifting icebergs in the NW Weddell Sea	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY												Glacier ice released to the oceans through iceberg formation has a complex effect on the surrounding ocean waters. We hypothesized that phytoplankton communities would differ in abundance, composition and production around or close to an iceberg. This paper tests the influence of individual icebergs on scales of meters to kilometers, observed through shipboard oceanographic sampling on March-April 2009. Surface waters (integrated 0-100 m depth, within the euphotic zone) sampled close to the iceberg C-18a ( <1 km) were characterized by lower temperatures, more dissolved nitrate, less total chlorophyll a (chla) concentration, less picoplankton ( <3 mu m) cell abundance, and higher transparency than surface conditions 18 km upstream. However, enrichment of large cells, identified as diatoms, was the basis of an active food chain. Upward velocity of meltwater and dissolved Fe concentrations in excess of 1-2 nM are expected to facilitate diatom specific growth. The presence of diatoms close to the iceberg C-18a and the higher variable fluorescence (Fv/Fm) indicated healthy cells, consistent with Antarctic waters rich in micronutrients. Furthermore, chla increased significantly 2 km around the iceberg and 10 days after the iceberg's passage. We hypothesize that the lower biomass next to the iceberg was due to high loss rates. Underwater melting is expected to dilute phytoplankton near the iceberg by entraining deep water or by introducing meltwater. In addition, high zooplankton biomass within 2 km of the iceberg, mainly Antarctic krill Euphausia superba and salps Salpa thompsonii, are expected to exert heavy grazing pressure on phytoplankton, the krill on large cells >10 mu m and the salps on smaller cells, 3-10 mu m. The iceberg's main influence in the austral fall is measured not so much by phytoplankton accumulation but by reactivation of the classic Antarctic food chain, facilitating diatom growth and sustaining high Antarctic krill populations.

Malnutrition is one of the main causes of children's short stature; therefore, nutritional intervention in adolescence is the key to prevent short stature. The peptides from Antarctic Krill (AKPs), the ideal protein model, act in bone formation and anti-osteoporosis. However, the studies on promoting longitudinal bone growth by AKPs have not been reported. Methods: Three-week-old male ICR mice, to construct the adolescent mice model, randomly divided into three groups: normal group, casein group (casein, 300 mg/kgmiddotBW), and AKPs group (AKPs, 300 mg/kgmiddotBW). After 21 days of drug administration, the effects of AKPs on serum biochemical indexes and femur histomorphology of mice, and the mechanism of AKPs promoting longitudinal bone growth was discussed. Results: AKPs significantly increased longitudinal bone growth and improved bone strength. In addition, AKPs remarkably promoted proliferation and hypertrophy of chondrocytes in the growth plate. The further mechanism revealed that AKPs increased serum Growth Hormone (GH) and Insulin-Like Growth Factors-1(IGF-1) contents, which activated the downstream GH/IGF-1 axis signaling pathways. Moreover, AKPs induced the secretion and expression of bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP2) and triggered the activation of BMP2-dependent Smads signaling. AKPs also activated Wnt/beta-catenin signaling, and synergistically activated the expression of Runt-related transcription factor 2 (Runx 2) and Osterix (OSX). Conclusion: AKPs promoted longitudinal bone growth by activating GH/IGF-1 axis, BMP-2/Smads and Wnt/beta-catenin pathways, suggesting AKPs to be a potential nutrient fortifier for longitudinal bone growth.

The encapsulation of KO in chitosan nanoparticles (CSNPs) was confirmed by using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) techniques. Loading capacity (LC) and encapsulation efficiency (EE) of the obtained particles were about 9-25 and 33-59% respectively, when the initial KO content was in the ratio of 0.25-1.25 g/g of Chitosan. Bulk KO showed less protection to oxidation and showed more formation of hydroperoxides during first week as noted by FTIR. However, KO loaded CSNPs showed better prevention of KO towards oxidation with less hydroperoxide formation even after two weeks of storage at elevated temperature (45 degrees C). The obtained KO-loaded CSNPs were irregular in shape with an average particle diameter of <130 nm as observed by SEM. The results obtained confirmed the suitability of the emulsion and later electrostatic interaction of CS with TPP for the formation of KO loaded CSNPs with greater EE & LC, which will enhance their usage in the Food and Pharmaceutical industries.

Krill SC-CO2 extraction was performed under the conditions of temperature range from 35 to 45 degrees C and pressure, 150-250 bar for 2.5 h with a constant flow rate of 22 g/min. Extraction yields of lipids increased with pressure and temperature. The digestive enzyme activities of protease, lipase and amylase of SC-CO2 treated krill residues were slightly decreased comparing to organic solvent, n-hexane and acetone treated residues. In SC-CO2 treated samples, all of the digestive enzymes showed slightly higher temperature stability. In the other hand the crude extracts of SC-CO2 and n-hexane treated krill samples showed almost same optimum pH and pH stability for each of the digestive enzymes.

Bengtson			Behavioural sensitivity of a key Southern Ocean species (Antarctic krill, Euphausia superba) to p,p '-DDE exposure	ECOTOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY												Persistent organic pollutants (POPs) have been frequently measured throughout the Southern Ocean food web for which little information is available to assess the potential risks of POP exposure. The current study evaluated the toxicological sensitivity of a key Southern Ocean species, Antarctic krill, to aqueous exposure of p,p'-dichlorodiphenyl dichloroethylene (p,p'-DDE). Behavioural endpoints were used as indicators of sublethal toxicity. Immediate behavioural responses (partial immobility and tail flicking) most likely reflect neurotoxicity, while the p,p'-DDE body residue causing a median level of sublethal toxicity in Antarctic krill following 96 h exposure (IEC50(sublethal) (toxicity) = 3.9 +/- 0.21 mmol/kg lipid weight) is comparable to those known to cause sublethal narcosis in temperate aquatic species. Critical body residues (CBRs) were more reproducible across tests than effective seawater concentrations. These findings support the concept of the CBR approach, that effective tissue residues are comparable across species and geographical ranges despite differences in environmental factors.

Effect of a carnivorous diet on the lipids, fatty acids and condition of Antarctic krill, Euphausia superba	ANTARCTIC SCIENCE					9th Scar International Biology Symposium	JUL 25-29, 2005	Curitiba, BRAZIL					Krill are thought to be predominantly herbivorous, but a heterotrophic diet might be crucial for their growth and survival. To compare the influence of herbivory and carnivory on krill we conducted a nine month feeding trial. We examined lipid composition of the hepatopancreas, abdomen and remaining body portions of krill fed diatoms at bloom condition levels, and diatoms with the addition of pellets or minced clam meat to simulate a partly carnivorous diet. Mortality, dry mass and lipid content were similar among treatments. We examined lipid class and fatty acid profiles, with emphasis placed on the ratio of storage (triacylglycerol) to structural (polar lipid) lipid and key essential omega 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids: 20:5 omega 3 and 22:6 omega 3. The triacylglycerol : polar lipid ratio increased in krill fed on the mixed diet as did the 20:5 omega 3 : 22:6 omega 3 ratio. Overall these findings indicate that provision of clam in the diet improved krill condition, and further suggest that carnivory may aid krill growth in the wild under certain environmental conditions.

Ability of the proteins to stabilize sunflower oil-based emulsions was firstly evaluated, and further the effects of NaCl concentration, pH values and storage temperatures on their stabilization were investigated. Results showed that the krill proteins contained much balanced essential amino acids compared to some plant proteins, and hydrophobic interactions and disulfide bonds greatly contributed to the development and stabilization of the protein aggregates. Antarctic krill proteins formed emulsions with their particle size less than 20 mu m under 3%-4% protein and oil/water ratios of 3:7-5:5. Moreover, higher krill proteins content (>= 3%), lower NaCl concentration (<= 100 mM) or higher temperatures (>= 40 degrees C) greatly favored the formation of gel-like networks of emulsions. Notably, the emulsions stabilized by 3% Antarctic krill proteins and oil/water ratio of 3:7 could resist the fluctuation of pH (3-9), salt concentration (50-400 mM) and temperatures (4-60 degrees C). Meanwhile, the emulsions exhibited a comparable long-term stability after 30 days storage compared to the existing proteins or biopolymers-stabilized emulsions. This study expends the knowledges of constructing novel Antarctic krill proteins-stabilized emulsions to unlock the high value-added utilization of marine protein resources in food industry.																	0023-6438	1096-1127				JUN	2020	128								109492	10.1016/j.lwt.2020.109492							WOS:000540290000049

The aim of this study was to compare seasonal differences in enzyme activity and respiration rates of larval and postlarval krill to provide insights into their overwintering strategies. Respiration rates, activity of the metabolic enzyme citrate synthase (CS), and those of the digestive enzymes laminarinase and total proteinase were measured in austral summer west of the Antarctic Peninsula, and in autumn in the southwestern Lazarev Sea. The 100-fold difference in chlorophyll a concentrations between the two studies is representative of the classic transition from a summer bloom to sparse winter conditions. Correspondingly, adult krill showed reduced respiration rates and CS activity in autumn. However, their digestive enzyme activity was significantly higher, suggesting more efficient assimilation of food, at low food levels. Similar-sized larvae showed no summer-autumn differences in respiration rates and enzyme activity, supporting suggestions that they need to feed and grow year-round. However, trends in enzymatic activity varied between the larval stages measured, implying ontogenetic changes in body structure and function.

A reference pattern with 34 arbitrarily numbered immunoprecipitates was established for a crude krill extract using IgG rabbit antiserum. A zymographic technique for detection of proteolytic activity was applied and revealed 4 casein-positive antigens. Introduction of different affinity media as intermediate gels in CIE demonstrated several proteins which strongly interacted with Sepharose-bound arginine and Con A. These results suggest the presence of trypsin-like enzymes and other serine proteases and a high content of glycoproteins with alfa-D-mannopyranoside and alfa-D-glycopyranoside residues. The CIE method thus offers a reliable and reproducible tool for identification and characterization of different krill enzymes as well as application in process control, when purifying individual proteins/enzymes. Moreover this technology may serve as a fingerprinting method suitable for biological studies such as classification of geographical subpopulations, genotyping a specific species as well as comparisons between different species.																	0722-4060					DEC	1991	11	7					489	493									WOS:A1991GU47800009						
J	Zhou, M; Zhu, YW; Peterson, JO				Zhou, M; Zhu, YW; Peterson, JO			In situ growth and mortality of mesozooplankton during the austral fall and winter in Marguerite Bay and its vicinity	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY												Zooplankton play a critical role in the austral winter ecosystem of the Southern Ocean, transporting biomass from lower to higher trophic level organisms through their consumption and growth, and ultimately determining the survival of marine animals such as sea birds and mammals. Previous studies have provided evidence that krill utilize zooplankton through austral winter when the primary production is negligible. Though they are different, all survival strategies produce the same result, a decrease in total zooplankton biomass. It is difficult to examine the total zooplankton biomass balance and process rates from traditional net tow samples because of the spatial variation in zooplankton distribution and the lack of applicable mathematical methods to estimate population process rates. This study focuses on short-term (overnight) loss rates of mesozooplankton associated with adult krill grazing in austral fall and the long-term (winter) body growth and removal rates of mesozooplankton in austral winter based on measurements of zooplankton size structures obtained using an Optical Plankton Counter (OPC) mounted on a Multiple Opening and Closing Nets and Environmental Sensing System (MOCNESS). In order to target an adult Euphausia superba aggregation for a short period, a 153 kHz Vessel-Mounted (VM) Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP) was used for the acoustic backscattering. The in situ process rates of growth and mortality are estimated based on the biomass balance and biomass spectrum theory. The overnight in situ grazing by adult E. superba on mesozooplankton is examined based on the in situ measurements of mesozooplankton biovolume within the water where an adult E. superba aggregation remained during a short study period in late April. The measurements show that approximately 16% of the existing mesozooplankton biovolume was removed in 4 h, which leads to an average specific daily grazing rate of 0.96 day(-1) assuming a daily feeding period of 16 h from dusk to dawn. From the amount of biovolume removed and the abundance of adult euphausiids of approximately 3 individuals m(-3) estimated from the volume backscattering strength and the size of adult euphausiids, the daily ration for an adult euphausiid is approximately equal to 7% body biovolume or biomass day(-1). The total mesozooplankton biovolume decreased at a specific rate of 0.017 day(-1) over the austral winter 2002, while the specific individual body growth was approximately 0.045 day(-1). The sum of these two rates leads to the specific mortality rate equal to approximately 0.07 day(-1) for the winter. These rates lead to a system efficiency of 67% for recycling the biomass during the winter. The measurements indicate that approximately 90% of biovolume (biomass) was removed in the period between the fall cruise in April-May and the winter cruise in August-September 2002.

Rapid warming of the ocean around South Georgia, Southern Ocean, during the 20th century: Forcings, characteristics and implications for lower trophic levels	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART I-OCEANOGRAPHIC RESEARCH PAPERS												The Southern Ocean is known to have warmed considerably during the second half of the 20th century but there are few locations with data before the 1950s. In addition, assessments of change in this region are hampered by the strong seasonal bias in sampling, with the vast majority of data collected during the austral summer. However, oceanographic measurements near South Georgia span most of the last century, and we here consider almost year-round data from this location over an 81-year period (1925-2006). We observe significant warming between the early and late 20th century, with differential warming between summer and winter months and an indication that late 20th century summer temperatures peaked similar to 6 days earlier. To quantify the long-term warming trend in this highly variable data, a mixed model utilising a Residual Maximum Likelihood (REML) method was used. Over the 81-year period, a mean increase of similar to 0.9 degrees C in January and similar to 2.3 degrees C in August was evident in the top 100 m of the water column. Warming diminished below 100 m and approached 0 at 200 m. Thus the long-term warming around South Georgia is substantial-more so than documented previously for the circumpolar warming of the Southern Ocean. We examine potential causal effects of this trend, including local atmospheric and cryospheric change, the influence of upstream waters and the role of coupled modes of climate variability such as El Nino/Southern Oscillation and the Southern Annular Mode (SAM). It is likely that all of these play a part in the observed temperature increase. However, the role of the SAM is strongly indicated, via its likely role in the circumpolar warming trend in the Southern Ocean, and also by the atypical response of the South Georgia region to changes in heat fluxes associated with the SAM. Furthermore. the combination of a regional decline in ice extent and strong upstream warming likely explains a significant part of the strong seasonal variation apparent in the warming trend. In addition, we consider the implications that long-term warming has for South Georgia's lower trophic levels. For Euphausia superba, at their northern limit, we find a significant negative relationship between summer South Georgia water temperatures and mean summer density of E superba across the southwest Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean. Simple abundance and growth rate relationships with our long-term temperature data appear to show declining habitat suitability for E superba. In contrast, the warming trend is likely to favour other macro- and mesozooplankton species that occupy the more northerly parts of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current, and it is likely to promote phytoplankton growth.

Krill reproductive and recruitment success, hence supply of krill to predator populations locally and in downstream areas, are extremely variable on interannual and longer time scales. Interannual ecosystem variability in this region has long been recognized and thought related to El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events, but understanding of how has been limited by the hydrographic complexity of the region and lack of appropriate ocean-atmosphere interaction models. This study utilizes multidisciplinary data sets collected in the region from 1990 to 2004 by the U.S. Antarctic Living Marine Resources (AMLR) Program. We focus on hydrographic conditions associated with changes in the distribution, abundance and composition of salp- and copepod-dominated zooplankton assemblages during 1998 and 1999, years characterized respectively by a strong El Nino event and La Nina conditions. We provide detailed analyses of hydrographic, biological and ecological conditions during these dichotomous years in order to identify previously elusive oceanographic processes underlying ecosystem variability. We found that fluctuations between salp-dominated coastal zooplankton assemblages and copepod-dominated oceanic zooplankton assemblages result from the relative influence of Weddell Sea and oceanic waters and that these fluctuations are associated with latitudinal movement of the Southern Antarctic Circumpolar Current Front (sACCf). Latitudinal movements of the sACCf can be explained by meridional atmosphere teleconnections instigated in the western tropical Pacific Ocean by ENSO variability and are consistent with out-of-phase forcing in the South Pacific and South Atlantic Oceans by the Antarctic Dipole high-latitude climate mode. During El Nino decreased northwest winds, equatorward movement of the sACCf and an intensified Weddell Gyre allow Weddell Sea water to flow into eastern Bransfield Strait. During these periods mixing between oceanic and coastal waters is reduced, chlorophyll a concentrations are low, salps numerically dominate the zooplankton, and krill recruitment success is poor. During La Nina increased and more frequent northwest winds and poleward movement of the sACCf allows increased influence of oceanic waters and mixing of these with cold coastal waters. These periods are characterized by numerical dominance of copepods, elevated concentrations of oceanic zooplankton taxa and phytoplankton blooms that promote krill reproduction and recruitment success. Hydrographic and ecological changes after the 1998 El Nino are associated with a shift from frequent El Ninos to the prevalence of La Nina and neutral conditions and conform to a decadal-scale climate regime shift in the Antarctic Peninsula region.

To shorten thawing time, the effects of salt, sucrose and moisture contents on dielectric properties at 915 and 2450MHz were also studied during microwave thawing (MT) and microwave heating (MH). The results indicate that the change in sucrose content had a smaller effect on dielectric properties, and only addition of salt had a significant influence (p < 0.05) on dielectric properties during MT. Moreover, when these shrimps with addition of a salt-sucrose mixture at 3% w/w were thawed and heated to 20 degrees C, the microwave processing time was no more than 130 s. Compared with the samples without any additives, thawing time shortened significantly when salt and sucrose were simultaneously added to the samples. Besides, the centre temperature and temperature distribution within the cross section of shrimps confirmed effects of various additives on dielectric properties, suggesting that MT and MH can be applied to the processing of freshwater and oceanic shrimp, and that addition of only salt or the salt-sucrose mixture can further quicken thawing and heating rates to optimize the industrial processing of shrimp.																	0832-7823						2017	51	1					3	30		10.1080/08327823.2017.1291067							WOS:000399572200002

Habitat-based density models of pack-ice seal distribution in the southern Weddell Sea, Antarctica	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												Climate variability and changes in sea ice dynamics have caused several ice-obligate or krill-dependent populations of marine predators to decline, eliciting concern about their demographic persistence and the indirect ecological consequences that predator depletions may have on marine ecosystems. Pack-ice seals are dominant ice-obligate predators in the Antarctic marine ecosystem, but there is considerable uncertainty about their abundance and population trends. We modelled the density and distribution of pack-ice seals as a function of environmental covariates in the southern Weddell Sea, Antarctica. Our density surface modelling approach used data from aerial surveys of pack-ice seals collected in the 2013/14 austral summer. Crabeater seals Lobodon carcinophaga, the most numerous pack-ice seal we observed, occurred at the highest densities in areas with extensive sea ice near the continental shelf break, but were almost absent in areas of similar sea ice concentration in the southern extent of the Weddell Sea. The highest densities of Weddell seals Leptonychotes weddelli, which were less abundant than crabeater seals within the pack-ice habitat, were predicted to occur over the continental shelf, near the shelf break. The distribution of both seal species broadly corresponded with the distribution and relative abundance of their main prey (Antarctic krill Euphausia superba and Antarctic silverfish Pleuragramma antarctica) obtained from concurrent ecosystem surveys. Ross seals Ommatophoca rossii and leopard seals Hydrurga leptonyx were not detected at all and are apparently rare within the southern Weddell Sea. These results can contribute to biodiversity assessments in the context of marine protected area planning in this region of the Southern Ocean.

The condition of larvae was quantified in both seasons by determining their body length (BL), dry weight (DW), elemental and biochemical composition, stomach content analysis, and rates of metabolism and growth. Overall the larvae in autumn were in better condition under the ice than in open water, and for those under the ice, condition decreased from autumn to winter. Thus, growth rates of furcilia larvae in open water in autumn were similar to winter values under the ice (mean, 0.008 mm d(-1)), whereas autumn under-ice values were higher (0.015 mm d(-1)). Equivalent larval stages in winter had up to 30% shorter BL and 70% lower DW than in autumn. Mean respiration rates of winter larvae were 43% lower than of autumn larvae. However, their ammonium excretion rates doubled in winter from 0.03 to 0.06 mu g NH4 DW-1 h(-1), resulting in mean O:N ratios of 46 in autumn and 15 in winter. Thus, differing metabolic substrates were used between autumn and winter, which supports a degree of flexibility for overwintering of larval krill. The larvae were eating small copepods (Oithona spp.) and protozoans, as well as autotrophic food under the ice. The interplay between under-ice topography, apparent current speed under sea ice, and the swimming ability of larval krill is probably critical to whether larval krill can maintain position and exploit suitable feeding areas under the ice.

Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) meal in the diets improved the reproductive performance of tongue sole (Cynoglossus semilaevis) broodstock	AQUACULTURE NUTRITION												A three-month feeding trial was conducted to investigate the effects of dietary krill meal on the reproductive performance of tongue sole broodstock. Three diets were formulated to contain different levels of krill meal, 0 (Diet K-0), 10 (K-100) and 200 (K-200) g kg(-1) dry matter, replacing the corresponding contents of protein and lipid from fishmeal and fish oil. Each diet was assigned to triplicate tanks. Compared with K-0, both K-100 and K-200 increased the egg properties such as buoyant eggs rate, egg diameter, oil droplet diameter and SOD activity of the fertilized egg. However, the maturation rate, serum estradiol content, the relative fecundity and hatching rate were improved only by K-100. The krill meal supplementation increased the concentrations of astaxanthin and n-3 fatty acids in eggs, but decreased the n-6 fatty acid concentrations. Both K-100 and K-200 increased the survival activity index, but the larval deformity rate was decreased only by K-100. At 15 DPH, the larval length and the digestive enzyme activities were significantly higher in group K-200 compared with groups K-0 and K-100. In conclusion, dietary supplementation of krill meal, at the level of 100 or 200 g kg(-1) dry matter in exchange of fishmeal and fish oil had the considerable positive effects on C.semilaevis reproduction.

DVM depth and migration patterns depend on oceanographic conditions with respect to temperature, light and oxygen availability at depth, factors that are highly dependent on season in most marine regions. Here we introduce a global krill respiration ANN (artificial neural network) model including the effect of latitude (LAT), the day of the year (DoY), and the number of daylight hours (DLh), in addition to the basal variables that determine ectothermal oxygen consumption (temperature, body mass and depth). The newly implemented parameters link space and time in terms of season and photoperiod to krill respiration. The ANN model showed a better fit (r(2) = 0.780) when DLh and LAT were included, indicating a decrease in respiration with increasing LAT and decreasing DLh. We therefore propose DLh as a potential variable to consider when building physiological models for both hemispheres. For single Euphausiid species investigated in a large range of DLh and DoY, we also tested the standard respiration rate for seasonality with Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) and General Additive model (GAM). GAM successfully integrated DLh (r(2) = 0.563) and DoY (r(2) = 0.572) effects on respiration rates of the Antarctic krill, Euphausia superba, yielding the minimum metabolic activity in mid-June and the maximum at the end of December. We could not detect DLh or DoY effects in the North Pacific krill Euphausia pacifica, and our findings for the North Atlantic krill Meganyctiphanes norvegica remained inconclusive because of insufficient seasonal data coverage. We strongly encourage comparative respiration measurements of worldwide Euphausiid key species at different seasons to improve accuracy in ecosystem modeling. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

J	Yoshitomi, B; Nagano, I				Yoshitomi, Bunji; Nagano, Ichiro			Effect of dietary fluoride derived from Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) meal on growth of yellowtail (Seriola quinqueradiata)	CHEMOSPHERE												Yellowtail (Serbia quinqueradiata) is the most important cultured marine fish in Japan. Dietary fish meal for yellowtail in aquaculture was replaced with 0.0%, 15.4% and 100.0% Antarctic krill meal (KM0, KM15, and KM100) and with 0.0%, 15.4%, and 100.0% low-fluoride krill meal (LFK0, LFK15 and LFK100). The fish was fed to duplicate fish groups for 92 d (KM trial) or 75 d (LFK trial), and fish growth was monitored. Dietary fluoride (F-) concentrations (mg kg(-1)) were 110, 160, and 580 (KM0, KM15, and KM100, respectively) and 98, 120, and 190 (LFK0, LFK15, and LFK100, respectively). The growth during the experimental period, weight gain, feed intake, specific growth rate, and feed efficiency in fish fed the KM100 diet were markedly lower than the other experimental groups, which showed no marked differences in growth performance. After the experiment, dorsal muscle fluoride concentrations in each group were below the detectable limit (1 mg kg-1), but vertebral bone fluoride concentrations increased with increasing proportion of KM to 655 (KM0), 870 (KM15), and 2150 (KM100) mg kg-1. With increasing LFK in the feed, vertebral bone fluoride concentrations (mg kg-1) increased slightly from 500 (LFK0) to 655 (LFK15), and 695 (LFK100). No histopathological changes were detected in the liver tissue in any experimental group. It has been reported that the fluoride bioavailability was reduced with increasing water hardness, however, the dietary fluoride derived from KM exoskeleton accumulates in vertebral bones of marine fish with growth inhibition, as has already been shown for freshwater fish. Vertebral bone fluoride concentrations in two krill-eating Antarctic marine fish in the wild were 33000 mg kg(-1) (Champsocephalus gunnari) and 15000 mg kg(-1) (Notothenia rossii), but they did not show any adverse effect of growth. Therefore, fish bone fluoride accumulation apparently depends on fish species rather than the salinity of the habitat. Consequently, krill exoskeleton must be removed during the processing of Antarctic krill if indeed these krill are to be used as fish feed. However, LFK can completely replace dietary fish meal without apparent adverse effects. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

THE ROLE OF FISH AS PREDATORS OF KRILL (EUPHAUSIA SUPERBA) AND OTHER PELAGIC RESOURCES IN THE SOUTHERN OCEAN	CCAMLR SCIENCE												Krill forms an important part of the diet of many Antarctic fish species. An understanding of the role of fish as krill predators in the Southern Ocean is critical to understanding how changes in fish abundance, such as through fishing or environmental change, are likely to impact on the food webs in the region. First attempts to estimate the krill and pelagic food consumption by Antarctic demersal fish in the low Antarctic were made in the late 1970s/early 1980s. Those estimates were constrained by a paucity of biomass estimates and the mostly qualitative nature of food studies. Food consumption estimates were extended to the mesopelagic realm and the high-Antarctic Zone in the late 1980s and early 1990s when these areas were exploited commercially for Electrona carlsbergi. Currently, the best estimates of annual krill consumption by fish are 23 000 000-29 000 000 tonnes of krill and other pelagic prey taken annually by demersal fish in the 1980s in the whole Southern Ocean, and 5 000 000-32 000 000 tonnes taken by mesopelagic fish in the Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean. It is clear from this review that fish are important predators of krill, in particular the larger myctophids and some channichthyids and nototheniids, and that the importance of krill in fish diets varies substantially both with time and location on various scales, as well as with the availability of alternate prey in the different regions in the Southern Ocean. Ecosystem models therefore need to account for their role. However, several key areas of uncertainty exist, which need to be considered in ecosystem and food-web models for the Southern Ocean. For instance, no robust estimates of food consumption by mesopelagic fish can be provided for the vast areas of the Indian and Pacific Ocean sectors, or for several of the most abundant myctophid species in the Atlantic sector, due to the paucity of relevant studies in these regions. Where biomass estimates do exist, such as in the Atlantic sector, there can be a lack of precision in trawl and hydroacoustic surveys. Studies that adequately capture the seasonal variation in consumption rates and changing importance of krill in the diet of fish are also rare. Furthermore, the effects of large changes in abundance and community structure of fishes brought about by industrial fishing need to be considered when evaluating patterns that have emerged in Southern Ocean ecosystems in the course of the 20th century. As a first step towards a modelling approach to include fish in krill-based food-web models, it is suggested to incorporate data on Champsocephalus gunnari from the western Atlantic sector and Dissostichus mawsoni from the Ross Sea into modelling approaches within the CCAMLR Ecosystem Monitoring Program. Both species are important predators of krill (C. gunnari) and fish (D. mawsoni) in turn form key prey for top predators in each region.

This separated the echo traces into five categories: three biotic and two abiotic in origin. The acoustic data were subsequently analysed in detail by comparing the acoustic parameter Mean Volume Backscattering Strength (MVBS) at 120 kHz with that at 38 kHz. The three biotic categories separated visually had significantly different mean DELTAMVBS values (DELTAMVBS = MVBS 120 kHz - MVBS 38 kHz). To investigate if the biotic categories could be identified solely on the basis of DELTAMVBS values, maximum-likelihood techniques were used to analyse the multimodal distribution of a further 1286 DELTAMVBS records. These analyses allowed ranges to be defined for DELTAMVBS which separate three biotic categories. On the basis of the target strength properties of the most likely scatterers in the region, the three categories were identified as krill, organisms larger than krill (fish or squid) and organisms smaller than krill (small zooplankton). The acoustic techniques described in this paper indicate a useful methodology in the study of Southern Ocean pelagic organisms.																	0142-7873					JUL	1993	15	7					787	802		10.1093/plankt/15.7.787							WOS:A1993LM94100005

Lipids were retained to a higher degree with krill protein solubilized at acidic rather than basic pH. The viscoelastic modulus (G') showed that recovered krill protein failed to form heat-induced gel unless beef plasma protein (BPP) was added. Therefore, protease inhibitors are suggested for development of krill-derived products. Even with BPP, the G' decreased between 45 and 55 degrees C. However, krill protein solubilized at acidic pH had a higher decrease of the G' than the protein solubilized at basic pH, likely due to krill endogenous cathepsin L. Krill protein-based gels developed from protein solubilized at basic pH, especially pH 12.0, had better texture (torsion and Kramer tests and texture profile analysis) than acidic counterparts, possibly due to higher proteolysis and denaturation at acidic pH. Gels made from protein solubilized at acidic pH were brighter and whiter likely due to a higher lipid content.

Swarm characteristics of Antarctic krill Euphausia superba relative to the proximity of land during summer in the Scotia Sea	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												We studied the relationship between the proximity of land and the distribution and swarming characteristics of Antarctic krill across the Scotia Sea in January and February 2003. Krill swarms identified with a Simrad EK60 (38 kHz, 120 kHz) echosounder were grouped into 4 categories according to distance from shoreline: 0 to 50 km, 50 to 100 km, 100 to 200 km and >200 km. Cross-sectional areas of swarms were significantly larger inshore, with a mean value of 120 m(2) in the 0 to 50 km zone compared to < 80 m(2) further offshore. The packing concentration of krill within inshore swarms was also significantly greater, with an average density of 95 ind. m(-3) compared to between 24 and 31 ind. m(-3) elsewhere. A large proportion of the biomass was concentrated into a small number of large, dense swarms throughout the survey area, and this trend increased with decreasing distance from shore. The highest median number of swarms per km and krill acoustic biomass per km was found in the 50 to 100 km zone. However, a significantly greater number of large, biomass-rich swarms occurred in the 0 to 50 km zone compared to all other zones. Swarms in the 0 to 50 km zone were also significantly further apart. The majority of swarms were located in the upper 50 m during the daytime although they were marginally deeper in the night in offshore regions. Krill are likely to move between inshore and offshore environments continuously over their lifetimes. The change in krill behaviour between environments could be a response to local predatory threats over short spatial and temporal scales.

Detailed studies of immobilization were performed, and PLAT was immobilized by physical adsorption onto DA -201. The best conditions for adsorption were as follows: protein loading= 85 mg PLAT /g support at a pH of 5 with 10 h of contact. For synthesis of PC with high levels of DHA, the effects of several parameters, including pressure, reaction time, temperature, enzyme loading and substrate molar ratio, were investigated to determine optimal conditions. The optimal substrate molar ratio of the FA to PC was 10. Under 12 MPa and 50 degrees C SCCO2, 59.0 mol% DHA was incorporated into PC after only 7 h at an immobilized enzyme loading rate of 15 wt% of the total substrates. The PC yield was 27.5 mol% under the optimal conditions. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

These strains were identified by 16s rDNA sequence analysis and grouped into eight different genera, including Bacillus, Shewanella, Psychrobacter, Klebsiella, Macrococcus, Aeromonas, Acinetobacter, and Saccharomyces. After fermentation of Antarctic krill powder using these strains, bioactive compounds including total phenolics, free amino acids, and enzyme activities were investigated. Meanwhile, antioxidant activities of the fermentation liquors were also detected. Results showed that bioactive compounds could be effectively produced through fermentation process by these strains, of which three strains (Bacillus subtilis OKF04, Macrococcus caseolyticus OKF09, and Aeromonas veronii OKF10) could produce more than 650 mg/L total phenolics or 2000 mg/L total free amino acids. In terms of enzyme activities, almost all of the strains showed protease activity and amylase activity, but only Bacillus cereus OKF01 and Bacillus megaterium OKF05 performed lipase activity and chitinase activity, respectively. All of the fermentation liquors showed antioxidant activity, within which Bacillus megaterium OKF05, Macrococcus caseolyticus OKF09, and Aeromonas veronii OKF10 displayed it more prominently. These results demonstrate that the Antarctic krill powder could be effectively converted by microorganisms isolated from deep-sea mud for production of bioactive compounds mixture.

Estimating the density of Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) from multi-beam echo-sounder observations using distance sampling methods	JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES C-APPLIED STATISTICS												Antarctic krill is a key species in the Antarctic food web, an important prey item for marine predators and a commercial fishery resource. Although single-beam echo-sounders are commonly used to survey the species, multi-beam echo-sounders may be more efficient because they sample a larger volume of water. However, multi-beam echo-sounders may miss animals because they involve lower energy densities. We adapt distance sampling theory to deal with this and to estimate krill density and biomass from a multi-beam echo-sounder survey. The method provides a general means for estimating density and biomass from multi-beam echo-sounder data.

J	Clarke, A; Tyler, PA				Clarke, Andrew; Tyler, Paul A.			Adult Antarctic krill feeding at abyssal depths	CURRENT BIOLOGY												Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) is a large euphausiid, widely distributed within the Southern Ocean [1], and a key species in the Antarctic food web [2]. The Discovery Investigations in the early 20(th) century, coupled with subsequent work with both nets and echosounders, indicated that the bulk of the population of postlarval krill is typically confined to the top 150 m of the water column [1, 3, 4]. Here, we report for the first time the existence of significant numbers of Antarctic krill feeding actively at abyssal depths in the Southern Ocean. Biological observations from the deep-water remotely operated vehicle Isis in the austral summer of 2006/07 have revealed the presence of adult krill (Euphausia superba Dana), including gravid females, at unprecedented depths in Marguerite Bay, western Antarctic Peninsula. Adult krill were found close to the seabed at all depths but were absent from fjords close inshore. At all locations where krill were detected they were seen to be actively feeding, and at many locations there were exuviae (cast molts). These observations revise significantly our understanding of the depth distribution and ecology of Antarctic krill, a central organism in the Southern Ocean ecosystem.																	0960-9822	1879-0445				FEB 26	2008	18	4					282	285		10.1016/j.cub.2008.01.059							WOS:000253470300028	18302926

We have assessed variability in krill recruitment and density with hypothesized environmental, factors, including strength of westerly winds (westerlies) determined from sea level pressure differences across the Drake Passage, sea ice cover, and ozone depletion. We found a significant positive correlation between krill recruitment in the Antarctic Peninsula area and the strength of westerlies during 1982-1998. Years with strong westerlies during the austral summer season resulted in high krill recruitment in 1987/1988, 1990/1991, and 1994/1995, while the years of weak westerlies resulted in low krill recruitment in 1982/1983, 1988/1989, 1992/1993, and 1996/1997. The strength of westerlies was significantly related to recruitment of 1-year-old krill (r = 0.57) and 2-year-old krill (r = 0.69) with a level of significance of 5%. In addition, the strength of westerlies also had a strong correlation with chlorophyll a (r = 0.63) and sea ice cover with a 1-year time lag (r = 0.67). The strength of westerlies is considered to be a key environmental factor. We also found significant correlations between krill density in the Antarctic Peninsula area and the Antarctic ozone depletion parameters during 1977-1997 (e.g., total ozone in October at Faraday/Vernadsky Station of I = 0.76 with a level of significance of 1%). We suspect that ozone depletion impacts directly and/or indirectly on the variability in krill density.																	2169-9275	2169-9291				SEP 15	1999	104	C9					20651	20665		10.1029/1999JC900136							WOS:000083473200011

Diets that replaced FM with KM at proportions of 0, 7, 15 and 30% (control, KM7, KM15, and KM30) were fed to groups of rainbow trout for 92 days and growth was observed. In fish fed KM7 and KM 15, weight gain (WG), feed intake (FI) and specific growth rate (SGR) were unchanged compared with fish fed the control diet, but in fish fed KM30, WG, FI and SGR significantly decreased. After the experiment, fluoride concentration in dorsal muscles of each experimental group was below the detected limit (1 mg/kg), but in vertebral bones, the fluoride concentration increased with each increase in KM inclusion in the diets: 490 mg/kg (control), 755 mg/kg (KM7), 1100 mg/kg (KM15), and 2400 mg/kg (KM30). Tissue specimens of liver of each experimental group had no histopathological changes. Therefore, accumulation of fluoride in vertebral bones apparently adversely affected growth of the vertebral bones thus affecting the growth performance as shown by the decrease in WG, FI and SGR.

Furcilia III larvae	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Physiological condition and feeding behavior of furcilia larvae were investigated in autumn (April 1999) in the southwestern Lazarev Sea prior to the critical overwintering period. Furcilia stage III (FIII) larvae were most abundant, so only these were used for all analyses (dry mass [DM], elemental and biochemical composition, gut content) and experiments (metabolic and ingestion rates, selective feeding behavior). Chlorophyll a (Ch1 a) concentrations in the mixed layer were <0.1 mug L-1. Respiration rates of freshly caught FIII larvae were between 0.4 and 1.2 mul O-2 mg(-1) DM h(-1), similar to larvae fed for 7 d on high food concentrations (4 mug Ch1 a L-1). Excretion rates ranged between 0.01 and 0.02 mug NH4 mg(-1) DM h(-1). Their atomic O:N ratio of 72 indicated that lipids were the main metabolic substrate of FIII larvae in the field. The daily C ration ranged from 0.4% at the lowest food concentration of 3 mug C L-1 to 28% at the highest enriched food concentration of 216 mug C L-1, whereas clearance rates decreased with increasing food concentrations. In natural seawater, 115 ml mg(-1) C h(-1), and in natural seawater enriched with ice biota, 24 ml mg(-1) C h(-1), the clearance rates on specific phytoplankton taxa revealed no significant difference across a food size range of 12-220 mum. The study suggests that during periods of low food supply in the water column, larvae have to exploit ice biota to cover their metabolic demands.

The research area comprised offshore, ice-edge and Ross Sea areas. Of the 3 years (1990/91, 1992/93 and 1994/95) included in the study, 1994/95 was a year of significantly poor body fat condition compared with the other 2 years. The 1994/95 year was characterized by extensive sea-ice conditions, covering the usually krill-rich slope region throughout the season. Since minke whales were scarce and their stomach-content mass small in the ice-edge area during 1994/95, food availability in the area during the season was considered to be poor as a result of the high sea-ice extent. Antarctic krill Euphausia superba was regularly the dominant prey species throughout the survey area, although on the Ross Sea shelf E. crystallorophias was the codominant prey with E. superba. The spatial distribution of body size and maturity of E. superba indicated apparent unsuitability of the Ross Sea area as a nursery and spawning ground for that species. The Ross Sea area was considered to be an area of low food supply throughout the study period, considering the lower level of stomach contents. Paradoxically, this area usually contained numerous minke whales, especially pregnant females. In conclusion, minke whales appear to have been affected by considerable interannual variability in food availability in the ice-edge area, i.e. potentially the most krill-rich area along their migratory route.																	0171-8630						1998	175						1	12		10.3354/meps175001							WOS:000077992700001

Results showed that AKP significantly increased bone mineral density, improved bone biomechanical properties, and ameliorated trabecular bone microstructure by promoting bone anabolism in SAMP6. Neonatal murine calvaria culture system further demonstrated that AKP stimulated osteoblast-induced new osteoid and bone formation ex vivo. The mechanism revealed that AKP induced the secretion and expression of bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP2), which was identified as a potent osteoinductive factor, and activated BMP2-dependent Smads signaling by phosphorylation of Smad1. Wnt signaling shares the same osteogenesis related transcriptional factor Runx2 with BMP2/Smads pathway. AKP also induced the activation of Wnt/-catenin signaling by upregulating the expression of Wnt10b and -catenin. In conclusion, AKP ameliorated senile osteoporosis by activating BMP2/Smads and Wnt/-catenin molecular pathways, thereby promoting bone formation. Practical applicationsAs a novel food material, Antarctic krill possesses an enormous biomass and utilization potential. It contains the largest amount of protein among all recorded organisms worldwide and the protein biological value is better than other animal proteins. This study demonstrated that peptides hydrolyzed from Antarctic Krill exhibit antiosteoporotic activity, which may provide some theoretical basis for the high-value of Antarctic Krill protein as antiosteoporotic functional foods in future.				yuntao, liu/AAO-6411-2020	yuntao, liu/0000-0002-8320-8725												0145-8884	1745-4514				AUG	2017	41	4							e12381	10.1111/jfbc.12381							WOS:000407085800010

Stratified mean density and biomass estimated for the whole surveyed area from RMT-8 hauls were among the lowest recorded (3.3 individuals 1000 m-3 and 3.1 g 1000 m-3) confirming Prydz Bay as a low krill abundance area in the Southern Ocean. Age cohorts 1+ to 4+ were present, the size of the animals increased from south to north and juveniles were mostly found in surface waters near the pack-ice. Adults were in an active reproductive phase: 98% of the females were mated and 35% were ready to spawn whereas 86% of the males carried spermatophores. Breeding was taking place in oceanic waters over deep zones with the spawning season limited to January-April. Phytoplankton biomass was also very low in the area (mean of 29 mg Chl a m-2 in the upper 200 m) and currents speed low, never reaching 10 cm s-1.

J	Tremblay, N; Abele, D				Tremblay, Nelly; Abele, Doris			Response of three krill species to hypoxia and warming: an experimental approach to oxygen minimum zones expansion in coastal ecosystems	MARINE ECOLOGY-AN EVOLUTIONARY PERSPECTIVE												To understand the adaptation of euphausiid (krill) species to oxygen minimum zones (OMZs), respiratory response and stress experiments combining hypoxia-reoxygenation exposure with warming were conducted. Experimental krill species were obtained from the Antarctic (South Georgia area), the Humboldt Current System (HCS, Chilean coast) and the Northern California Current System (NCCS, Oregon). Euphausia mucronata from the HCS showed oxyconforming pO(2)-dependent respiration below 80% air saturation (18kPa). Normoxic subsurface oxygenation in winter posed a high oxygen stress' for this species. The NCCS krill, Euphausia pacifica, and the Antarctic krill, Euphausia superba, maintained respiration rates constant down to low critical pO(2) values of 6kPa (30% air saturation) and 11kPa (55% air saturation), respectively. Antarctic krill had low antioxidant enzyme activities, but high concentrations of the molecular antioxidant glutathione (GSH) and was not lethally affected by 6h exposure to moderate hypoxia. The temperate krill species (E.pacifica) had higher superoxide dismutase (SOD) values in winter than in summer, which relates to a higher winter metabolic rate. In all species, antioxidant enzyme activities remained constant during hypoxic exposure at the typical temperature for their habitat. Warming by 7 degrees C above habitat temperature in summer increased SOD activities and GSH levels in E.mucronata (HCS), but no oxidative damage occurred. In winter, when the NCCS is well mixed and the OMZ is deeper, +4 degrees C of warming combined with hypoxia represents a lethal condition for E.pacifica. In summer, when the OMZ expands upwards (100m subsurface), antioxidant defences counteracted hypoxia and reoxygenation effects in E.pacifica, but only at mildly elevated temperature (+2 degrees C). In this season, experimental warming by +4 degrees C reduced antioxidant activities and the combination of warming with hypoxia again caused mortality of exposed specimens. We conclude that a climate change scenario combining warming and hypoxia represents a serious threat to E.pacifica and, as a consequence, NCCS food webs.				, Nelly/K-2552-2014	, Nelly/0000-0002-8221-4680; Abele, Doris/0000-0002-5766-5017												0173-9565	1439-0485				FEB	2016	37	1					179	199		10.1111/maec.12258							WOS:000370133500013

Results showed that BEW reduced 30.9% (w/w) NaOH consumption for the extraction of krill proteins, and its negative redox potential (-800 similar to -900 mV) protected the active groups (carbonyl, free sulfhydryl, etc.) of the proteins from oxidation compared to deionized water (DW). Moreover, the ultrasound-assisted BEW increased the extraction yield (9.4%), improved the solubility (8.5%), reduced the particle size (57 nm), favored the transition of a-helix and beta-turn to beta-sheet, promoted the surface hydrophobicity and disulfide bonds formation of krill proteins when compared to BEW without ultrasound. These changes contributed to the enhanced foam capacity, foam stability and emulsifying capacity of the krill proteins. Notably, all the physicochemical, structural and functional properties of the krill proteins were comparable to those extracted by the traditional ultrasound-assisted DW. This study suggests that the ultrasound-assisted BEW can be a potential candidate to extract proteins, especially offering an alternative way to produce marine proteins with high nutritional quality.

J	Frazer, TK; Quetin, LB; Ross, RM				Frazer, TK; Quetin, LB; Ross, RM			Abundance, sizes and developmental stages of larval krill, Euphausia superba, during winter in ice-covered seas west of the Antarctic Peninsula	JOURNAL OF PLANKTON RESEARCH												Larval krill were sampled west of the Antarctic Peninsula during three winter cruises: September 1991, June 1993 and September 1993. Larval abundances were estimated from net catches and compared directly to visual counts (made by a SCUBA diver) of larvae occupying the ice habitat at the same sampling stations. The number of larvae per square meter sampled with nets was more often greater than that observed by the diver, irrespective of the sampling period. However, comparisons of larval abundance within sampling periods were not statistically significant. Larval krill collected by divers were significantly larger than those collected with nets for each of the three cruises. The stage composition of larval krill also depended on the collection method: net-collected samples contained a disproportionately high number of early furcilia larvae in June 1993 (early winter), and a disproportionately low number of early juveniles during September 1991 and 1993 (late winter). These results lead us to suggest that larval/juvenile krill occupy both the water column and sea ice habitat during the austral winter, and that there are often differences in the sizes and developmental stages of the two groups. For larval krill that occupied the sea ice habitat, aggregations were larger and more numerous during late winter than in early winter. In addition, larvae within aggregations occupied structurally complex microhabitats, provided by over-rafted ice floes, more often than they occupied smooth, downward-facing ice surfaces where ice was not over-rafted.																	0142-7873					OCT	2002	24	10					1067	1077		10.1093/plankt/24.10.1067							WOS:000178558900009

Predictive models based on food, temperature, body length, sex, and maturity stage	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												We used the instantaneous growth rate method to determine the effects of food, temperature, krill length, sex, and maturity stage on in situ summer growth of krill across the southwest Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean. The main aims were to examine the separate effects of each variable and to generate a predictive model of growth based on satellite-derivable environmental data. Both growth increments in length on moulting (GIs) and daily growth rates (DGRs, min d(-1)) ranged greatly among the 59 swarms, from 0.58-15% and 0.013-0.32 mm d(-1). However, all swarms maintained positive mean growth, even those in the low chlorophyll a (Chl a) zone of the central Scotia Sea. Among a suite of indices of food quantity and quality, large-scale monthly Chl a values from SeaWiFS predicted krill growth the best. Across Our Study area, the great contrast between bloom and nonbloom regions was a major factor driving variation in growth rates, obscuring more subtle effects of food quality. GIs and DGRs decreased with increasing krill length and decreased above a temperature optimum of 0.5 degrees C. This probably reflects the onset of thermal stress at the northern limit of krill's range. Thus, growth rates were fastest in the ice edge blooms of the southern Scotia Sea and not at South Georgia as previously suggested. This reflects both the smaller size of the krill and the colder water in the south being optimum for growth. Males tended to have higher GIs than females but longer intermoult periods, leading to similar DGRs between sexes. DGRs of equivalent-size krill tended to decrease with maturity stage, suggesting the progressive allocation of energy toward reproduction rather than somatic growth. Our maximum DGRs are higher than most literature values, equating to a 5.7% increase in mass per day. This value fits within a realistic energy budget, Suggesting a maximum carbon ration of similar to 20% d(-1). Over the whole Scotia Sea/South Georgia area, the gross turnover of krill biomass was similar to 1% d(-1).

J	Rathod, V				Rathod, V			Zooplankton studies with special reference to krill Euphausia superba Dana from fishing area 58 of Indian Ocean sector in Southern Ocean	CURRENT SCIENCE												Distribution, abundance and species composition of zooplankton collected during the First Indian Antarctic Krill Expedition were studied. Zooplankton biomass values ranged from 9.79 to 303.62 ml 100 m(-3) (x = 142.14 +/- 77.02). High standing stock values were recorded in the study area, where copepods, chaetognaths, euphausiids and salps were dominant taxa. Copepods and chaetognaths formed the major constituents of zooplankton community and comprised more than 70% of zooplankton catch. Swarms of krill and salps were observed during the study period (austral summer), which were the prime cause for high standing stock of zooplankton. The prevailing physico-chemical parameters with rich food supply were important factors influencing the geographical distribution of different zooplankton groups. The study revealed that the present investigation site falls under potential krill fishing ground.																	0011-3891					AUG 25	2005	89	4					681	686									WOS:000231637800031

J	Daly, KL				Daly, KL			Overwintering growth and development of larval Euphausia superba: an interannual comparison under varying environmental conditions west of the Antarctic Peninsula	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY												Growth, molting, and development of larval Antarctic krill were investigated near Marguerite Bay during four cruises in austral autumn and winter 2001 and 2002, as part of the US Southern Ocean GLOBEC program. Overwintering survival of larvae has been linked to annual sea-ice formation and extent, as sea-ice biota may provide food when other sources are scarce in the water column. During autumn 2001, larvae were very abundant (1-19 individuals m(-3)), with younger stages dominant offshelf and older stages dominant on-shelf. On-shelf larvae were in better condition than offshore larvae. During autumn 2002, larvae again were abundant offshelf (0.01-110 m(-3)), whereas all stages were scarce on-shelf. Declining diatom and radiolarian blooms were present during autumn in both years. Average chlorophyll concentrations were low (0.10 vs. 0.22 mug 1(-1)) in autumn and an order of magnitude lower in winter. Carbon content of larvae during autumn 2001 and 2002 (41% vs. 38% C of DW) suggested that lipid storage was moderate. The median autumn larval growth rate (0.027 mm d(-1)) was lower and the intermolt period (19 d) longer than reported summer values. During winter, larvae appeared to be food-limited based on the following observations: (1) the median growth rate decreased (0.00 mm d(-1)) and the intermolt period increased (40 d), (2) larval length-specific dry weight (DW) and % carbon and nitrogen of DW decreased, and (3) 88 % of furcilia 6 did not develop to the juvenile stage, but remained at the same stage after molting. Experimental results demonstrated that some larvae could survive starvation for a month by combusting body reserves (ca. 1 % decrease in DW and body C and Nd-1), implying that a portion of the population was resilient to the suboptimal food supply. Although sea ice formed up to 2 months earlier in 2002, ice algae at the ice-water interface, where it is accessible to krill, was not an abundant food source in either year (0.05 vs. 0.07 mug chl 1(-1)). In winter 2001, furcilia were commonly observed near the undersurface of sea-ice, but only rarely in 2002 until mid-September, when ice algae began to accumulate. Low gut fluorescence values also indicate that little nutrition was derived from autotrophs in winter. Instead, larvae were likely opportunistic scavengers exploiting all available food sources, including microzooplankton, benthic larvae, detritus, scarce phytoplankton and sea-ice biota. In summary, larval krill exhibited several overwintering behaviors: (1) flexible feeding, (2) flexible morphology (i.e., delayed development), (3) flexible physiology (i.e., increased intermolt period, reduced growth), (4) moderate lipid storage, and (5) ability to withstand starvation by combusting body C and N. Because most larvae did not shrink in length, this measure may not be a good indicator of the body combustion strategy. At these high latitudes, sea-ice biota may not be a primary source of food during winter, but progressively more important in spring as irradiance levels increase. Winter survivors during 2001 resulted in a significant recruitment to the juvenile size class during spring. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

The diatoms were used as indicators of sources of krill food. Principal component analysis divided the diatom taxa into two groups, one being pelagic diatoms and from the food of krill in coastal waters, and the other being benthic diatoms and taxa from the food of krill in Admiralty Bay. All pelagic taxa of diatoms were consumed by krill. In the summer in coastal waters, benthic diatoms in krill food originated from the sublittoral. In the summer in Admiralty Bay, besides phytoplankton, diatoms were noted from the sublittoral and littoral in the food of krill. However, in the winter mostly sublittoral and epiphytic diatoms were present in krill food.																	0722-4060					SEP	2000	23	9					619	625		10.1007/s003000000131							WOS:000089208600004						
J	Thomson, RB; Butterworth, DS; Boyd, IL; Croxall, JP				Thomson, RB; Butterworth, DS; Boyd, IL; Croxall, JP			Modeling the consequences of Antarctic krill harvesting on Antarctic fur seals	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS												In terms of the convention governing the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR), management advice for the Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) fishery should take the needs of the predators of krill into account in order to reduce the risk of deleterious impacts on such predators (e.g., baleen whales and numerous fish, seal, penguin, and flying bird species). A single species yield model is currently being used by the CCAMLR Scientific Committee to recommend an annual krill catch limit, which is expressed as a proportion (gamma = 0.116) of a survey biomass estimate. This approach takes the needs of predators into account in only a crude way by assuming that a median krill escapement of 75% of its unexploited biomass would be sufficient to meet the needs of predators. A krill-predator modeling procedure is presented that could be used to directly assess the impact of krill harvesting on krill predator populations and therefore to revise this recommended harvesting level (gamma) for Antarctic krill. Application of a deterministic form of this model to an Antarctic fur seal (Arctocephalus gazella) data set from Bird Island, South Georgia, Antarctica, indicates that the level of krill fishing intensity (gamma) that would reduce this population to half the equilibrium size in the absence of krill fishing (gamma (half)) lies between 0.03 and 0.18, which includes the level recommended by CCAMLR. This large range results primarily from the sensitivity of the model to the maximum growth rate parameter, for which a range of 5-15%/yr is investigated. A plausible range of values for this parameter (5-15%/yr) results in estimated gamma (half) values from 0.04 to 0.23. Stochastic calculations (which take account of interannual fluctuations in the abundance of the krill population due to recruitment variability) yield higher estimated gamma (half) values than the less realistic deterministic calculations. However, simulation tests indicate that the estimated gamma (half) values are biased upward; this modeling approach is therefore likely to yield gamma (half) values that would lead to a depletion of the Antarctic fur seal population to more than half its pristine size.

The effect of the different stabilisers was evaluated both in solution and in dry samples of the enzymes. In 40% (w/v) stabiliser solutions, the increase in half-life of enzyme activity followed the pattern: sorbitol > xylitol > glycerol > sucrose > maltodextrins, when polyols and polysaccharides were used. In 3% (w/v) protein solutions, the stabilising effect followed the order: hydrolysed collagen > bovine serum albumin > casein. The best result was obtained in a 50% (w/v) sorbitol solution where a 12-fold half-life increase was achieved. Different mechanisms of stabilisation were observed for these two groups of substances. In 50% (w/w) dry enzyme/stabiliser mixtures, the increase in half-life of krill trypsin-like enzymes was: maltodextrins > sucrose > sorbitol > mannitol > xylitol. Dry samples were also prepared by coprecipitation of the enzyme/stabiliser mixture with 95% ethanol, followed by oven drying of the coprecipitates. Under these conditions, the modified maltodextrin PSM 10 (Reppe-Glykos AB, Sweden) gave the best result with a 25-fold half-life increase. The relevance of this result for the industrial application of krill trypsin-like enzymes is discussed.

A comment on Cox et al	JOURNAL OF CRUSTACEAN BIOLOGY												Antarctic krill (Euphausia superbaDana, 1850) exemplifies the key role of marine crustaceans in fisheries, foodwebs, and biogeochemical cycles. Ecological understanding and policy decisions require information on population trends. We have therefore worked with international colleagues to publish KRILLBASE, a database of fishery-independent krill population information for every decade since the 1970s. These data were used by Cox et al. (2018) who dispute the evidence for a late twentieth-century decline in krill density (number per unit area) in the Southwest Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean and claim to overturn much of recent thinking about climate-driven change in krill populations. They support this claim with an analysis which reaffirms one non-significant result from an earlier paper but does not challenge the five significant results from that paper or those of other studies which support a decline. In this comment we examine the methods which led Cox and coauthors to conclude that krill density has been stable over the last 40 years. Although these authors provide a potentially useful approach, we show that their analysis was biased by the exclusion of usable net types, the inclusion of negatively biased data and down-weighting of high densities in the early part of the analysis period, the absence of recent data from the north of the sector, and a lack of statistical hypothesis testing. These factors maximise the chances of failure to detect a real decline. To aid future analyses we provide recommendations to supplement those which accompany KRILLBASE. We also suggest the need for consensus scientific advice on krill population dynamics based on agreed standards of evidence, evaluation of uncertainty, and a thorough understanding of the data. This will be more useful to policy makers and other stakeholders than polarised opinions. Meanwhile, the evidence for a decline in krill density still stands.

Due to krill endogenous proteases ISP-KPI barely forms gel which is a major hurdle in wide application of this tremendous protein source for direct human consumption. The objective was to improve gelation and elucidate interaction mechanism between kappa-carrageenan and KPI kappa-Carrageenan was added to KPI at 0.00, 0.75, 1.50, 2.25, and 3.00 g/150 g and heated at 90 degrees C for 15 min. Added' kappa-carrageenan improved texture of KPI gels. However, the level of addition had minimal effect. SDS-PAGE revealed severe proteolysis of KPI even during heating. Total and free sulfhydryl were not different, while surface hydrophobicity and water-holding-capacity slightly decreased and increased, respectively with added kappa-carrageenan. Fourier-transform-infrared-spectroscopy showed none-tominimal shift of beta-sheet and alpha-helical protein structure; while C-C and C-O stretching as well as C-H bending of kappa-carrageenan showed the greatest shift, indicating that kappa-carrageenan was mainly responsible for gel formation.																	0308-8146	1873-7072				APR 25	2019	278						644	652		10.1016/j.foodchem.2018.11.080							WOS:000453529300081	30583424

AK was used to replace 0 (control), 25%, 50% and 100% of the fishmeal in the basic diet of crayfish to formulate four test feeds with basically equivalent nitrogen and lipid contents; these feeds were denoted AKO, AK25, AK50 and AK100, respectively. Compared with the control group, crayfish fed diets with AK replacement showed increased body weight gain; feed efficiency; survival rate; body protein content; phenoloxidase, superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase activities; total haemocyte counts; number of hyaline, semigranular and granular cells; and disease resistance against Aeromonas hydrophila. Conversely, the body lipid level of these crayfish decreased relative to that of the control. However, a high AK level (AK100) does not show improvements in efficiency compared with a moderate AK level (AK50). Based on the efficiency of AK in enhancing the growth performance and nonspecific immunity of crayfish, the optimum replacement proportion of fishmeal with AK was 50%. These results confirm that AK can promote the growth of crayfish and improve their disease resistance.																	1050-4648	1095-9947				JAN	2020	96						122	125		10.1016/j.fsi.2019.12.004							WOS:000509617400014	31805411					
J	Kirkwood, R; Robertson, G				Kirkwood, R; Robertson, G			The foraging ecology of female Emperor Penguins in winter	ECOLOGICAL MONOGRAPHS												The foraging location, diving behavior, dietary composition, and feeding rates of female Emperor Penguins (Aptenodytes forsteri) from the Auster and Taylor Glacier colonies in Antarctica were investigated during the 1993 austral winter. The study was conducted between late May and early August, when male emperors remain at the colonies to incubate eggs and females forage at sea for self-maintenance. During winter, two satellite-tracked penguins from Auster foraged approximate to 100 km northeast of the colony in open water 200-500 m deep, over the outer continental shelf and shelf slope. Ten Auster and four Taylor Glacier penguins that carried time-depth recorders took approximate to 8 d to reach the ice edge, spent 50-60 d at sea foraging, and took 4 d to return across the fast ice to the colony. The females occasionally huddled together to minimize heat loss while in transit to the ice edge and between foraging days. The penguins foraged on 93.2% of their days at sea and rested for the remainder. On each foraging day, penguins usually entered the water just after dawn and averaged 4.71 h in the water before exiting at dusk. The hourly dive rate was constant throughout winter, but the daily dive rate increased as day length increased, suggesting that day length is a primary determinant of hunting effort. Penguins exhibited behavior indicative of foraging on 47% of their dives, the remainder being travel or search dives. Penguins made, on average, 26 foraging dives/d. Females from Auster targeted prey at water depths of 20-70 m and 100-150 m, whereas Taylor Glacier birds targeted prey at 10-70 m, 250-300 m, and 330-400 m, suggesting between-colony differences in prey distribution. The stomach contents of 17 females returning to Auster to brood their chicks were dominated by pelagic prey species: Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba, 70% by mass) and Antarctic silverfish (Pleuragramma antarcticum, 13% by mass). Food consumption rates during winter for five penguins from both colonies were similar and averaged 62.6 +/- 5.8 g.kg(-1).d(-1) (1.8 +/- 0.1 kg/d for a 28.8 kg female), which equated to a metabolizable energy intake of 236.6 +/- 22.0 kJ/kg for each day they foraged (all, values are mean +/- 1 SD). This enabled the birds to gain approximate to 6.1 kg for a trip spanning approximate to 70 d. Based on mean prey masses and the penguins' dive rates, the penguins consumed approximate to 115 x 0.6 g krill or 16 x 4.3 g Antarctic silverfish per foraging dive, or some combination of both. In their winter trip, each breeding female consumed approximate to 100 bg of prey. The female populations at Auster and Taylor Glacier consumed an estimated 1350 Mg and 250 Mg of prey, respectively, in winter.																	0012-9615	1557-7015				MAY	1997	67	2					155	176		10.1890/0012-9615(1997)067[0155:TFEOFE]2.0.CO;2							WOS:A1997WX48100002

Impacts of rising sea temperature on krill increase risks for predators in the Scotia Sea	PLOS ONE												Climate change is a threat to marine ecosystems and the services they provide, and reducing fishing pressure is one option for mitigating the overall consequences for marine biota. We used a minimally realistic ecosystem model to examine how projected effects of ocean warming on the growth of Antarctic krill, Euphausia superba, might affect populations of krill and dependent predators (whales, penguins, seals, and fish) in the Scotia Sea. We also investigated the potential to mitigate depletion risk for predators by curtailing krill fishing at different points in the 21st century. The projected effects of ocean warming on krill biomass were strongest in the northern Scotia Sea, with a >= 40% decline in the mass of individual krill. Projections also suggest a 25% chance that krill biomass will fall below an established depletion threshold (75% of its unimpacted level), with consequent risks for some predator populations, especially penguins. Average penguin abundance declined by up to 30% of its unimpacted level, with up to a 50% chance of falling below the depletion threshold. Simulated krill fishing at currently permitted harvest rates further increased risks for depletion, and stopping fishing offset the increased risks associated with ocean warming in our model to some extent. These results varied by location and species group. Risk reductions at smaller spatial scales also differed from those at the regional level, which suggests that some predator populations may be more vulnerable than others to future changes in krill biomass. However, impacts on predators did not always map directly to those for krill. Our findings indicate the importance of identifying vulnerable marine populations and targeting protection measures at appropriate spatial scales, and the potential for spatially-structured management to avoid aggravating risks associated with rising ocean temperatures. This may help balance tradeoffs among marine ecosystem services in an uncertain future.				, Jefferson/AAG-1702-2021; Simeon, Hill L/B-2307-2008	, Jefferson/0000-0002-3600-1414; 												1932-6203					JAN 31	2018	13	1							e0191011	10.1371/journal.pone.0191011							WOS:000423668400032	29385153

Strain 116 was previously isolated from the stomach of a specimen of the Antartic krill Euphasia superba Dana and tentatively characterized as Sphingomonas paucimobilis 116. The 16S rDNA sequence analysis showed that the strain is in fact related to species of the genus Psychrohactex; next to Psychrobacter glacincola (97.4% similarity). Sequence similarities between strain 116 and other Psychrobacter species ranged from 96.9% (with P. urativorans) to 95.4% (with P. immobilis). Key phenotypic characteristics as well as chemotaxonomic features of the bacterium were congruent with the description of the genus Psychrobacter i.e. cells were strictly aerobic, strongly oxidase-positive, psychrotrophic, halotolerant, Gram-negative non-motile coccobacilli, with ubiquinone-8 as the main respiratory lipoquinone and 18:1 cis 9, 16:1 cis and 17:1 (omega 8c being the predominant cellular fatty acids. The G+C content of the DNA was 43.6 mot%. DNA-DNA hybridization studies showed chat the relatedness between strain 116 and Psychrobacter glacincola is only 62.2%. Further differences were apparent in whale-cell SDS-PAGE: protein pattern, cellular fatty acid profile and in a number of physiological and biochemical characteristics as well as in enzymatic activities. tolerance to 5% bile sails, nitrate reduction, citrate utilization, acid production from carbohydrates, alkaline phosphatase, acid phosphatase, C4 esterase, C14 lipase and valine arylamidase were found to differentiate strain 116 from Psychrobacter glacincola. On the basis of this phenotypic and molecular evidences, strain 116, previously known as Sphingomonas paucimobilis 116, was recognized as a new species of the genus Psychrobacter for which the name Psychrobacter proteolyticus is proposed. Strain 116 has been deposited in the Collection de I'Intsitut Pasteur, France, as CIP106830(T) and in the Deutsche: Sammlung von Mikroorganismen and Zellkulturen, as DSM13887(.)(T)					Denner, Ewald B.

J	Shin, HC; Nicol, S				Shin, HC; Nicol, S			Using the relationship between eye diameter and body length to detect the effects of long-term starvation on Antarctic krill Euphausia superba	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												Body shrinkage may be one of the strategies that Antarctic krill use to cope with food scarcity, particularly during winter. Despite their demonstrated ability to shrink, there are only very limited data to determine how commonly shrinkage occurs in the wild. It has been previously shown that laboratory-shrunk krill tend to conserve the size of the eye. This study examined whether the relationship between the eye diameter and body length could be used to detect whether krill had been shrinking, By tracking individuals over time and examining specimens sampled as groups, it was demonstrated that fed and starved krill are distinguishable by the relationship between the eye diameter and body length. The eye diameter of starved krill did not decrease, even when the animals had shrunk in overall body length, The eye diameter of well-fed krill continued to increase as overall length increased. This created a distinction between fed and starved krill, while no separation was detected in terms of the body length to weight relationship. Eye growth of krill re-commenced with re-growth of krill following shrinkage although there was some time lag. It would take approximately 2 moult cycles of shrinkage at modest rates to significantly change the eye diameter to body length relationship between normal and shrunk krill. If krill starve for a prolonged period in the wild, and hence shrink, the eye diameter to body length relationship should be able to indicate this, This would be particularly noticeable at the end of winter.																	0171-8630						2002	239						157	167		10.3354/meps239157							WOS:000178175000015

During the southern ocean global ecosystem dynamics (SO GLOBEC) research cruise in July/August 2001 aboard the ARSV Laurence M. Gould west of Adelaide Island and Marguerite Bay, larval krill were observed in the under-ice habitat. Ten instantaneous growth rate experiments were conducted with larvae collected from the under-ice habitat on the outer shelf, mid-shelf, and just south of Adelaide Island in the mouth of Marguerite Bay. For all experiments, average growth increments for larval krill were about -1.6% per intermolt period, with a median intermolt period of 30.6d. Larvae were observed feeding on the ice, even though no color was visible in the ice. Pigment (chlorophyll a equivalents) content of larvae from three of the sites was measured as an indicator of ingestion of sea-ice microalgae. Pigment values were above those found in starved controls, but only about 20% of maximum possible values. Although feeding, the data suggested that the larval krill were unable to ingest enough food to maintain growth. The results from this first SO GLOBEC winter process cruise were compared to growth rates of larval krill during previous winter cruises that covered all months from late May through September, except for the month of August.

Composition and structure of macrozooplankton and micronekton communities in the vicinity of free-drifting Antarctic icebergs	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY												Recent warming warming in the Antarctic has led to increased production of icebergs: however, the ecological effects of icebergs on pelagic communities within the Southern Ocean have not been well-studied. We used a 10 m(2) MOCNESS to collect macrozooplankton and micronekton in the upper 300 m of the water column near free-drifting icebergs in the Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean during three seasons: December 2005 (late spring), June 2008 (late fall) and March-April 2009 (late summer). Communities were dominated in all three seasons by Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) and salps (Salpa thompsoni), which collectively comprised 60-95% of the community wet biomass in most cases. During our spring and summer cruises, mean biomass was elevated by 3.1-4.3x at a distance of 0.37 km from large icebergs vs. 9.26 km away. These differences were not statistically significant, and no trend in biomass with distance was apparent in samples from fall 2008, when total biomass was an order of magnitude lower. Biomass levels near icebergs during Dec 2005 and Mar-Apr 2009 were comparable to values reported from marginal ice zones, suggesting that waters around icebergs support macrozooplankton and micronekton communities comparable in magnitude to those in some of the most productive areas of the Southern Ocean. Sample variance also was significantly higher within 1.85 km of icebergs during Dec 2005 and Mar-Apr 2009, reflecting increased patchiness on scales sampled by the MOCNESS (20-40 x 10(3) m(3) filtered per sample). This pattern was not significant during Jun 2008. Large predatory medusae were observed within 1.85 km of icebergs and in Iceberg Alley, an area through which icebergs pass frequently, but were virtually absent in areas remote from icebergs. Small euphausiids showed an inverse distribution, with low densities in areas populated by large medusae. A shift in community composition from a near-iceberg assemblage dominated by herbivores to a carnivore-dominated community in Iceberg Alley may reflect a transition from bottom-up to top-down control with increasing distance and time. Body sizes of dominant species varied seasonally but did not show consistent trends with distance from icebergs. Concentrations of photosynthetic pigments in the guts of E. superba and S. thompsoni corresponded broadly to patterns in surface chlorophyll a concentrations and were comparable to maximum gut pigment concentrations measured in animals collected from highly productive marginal ice zones. Our results suggest that the macrozooplankton and micronekton assemblages near free-drifting icebergs can be quantitatively and qualitatively different from those in surrounding, iceberg-free waters, perhaps due to both bottom-up and top-down processes as well as physical forcing by the passage of a large object through the upper ocean.

Here, we describe the morphology and ecology of E. crystallorophias furcilia stages F3-F6,. with emphasis on characteristics that distinguish them from E. superba, based on samples collected west of the Antarctic Peninsula during autumn and winter 2001 and 2002. During autumn most E. crystallorophias occurred as F4s (53%) and F5s (35%), while E. superba occurred in all furcilia stages (F1-F6). During winter, F6 was the dominant stage (>67%) for both species. On average, body lengths of E. crystallorophias larval stages were significantly greater than those of E. superba. During autumn, densities of the two species were similar (range: 0.003-11.8 m(-3)) at many on-shelf stations, with lower densities during winter. Where both species occurred, > 58% of E. crystallorophias furcilia were collected between 50 and 100 m depth, while 82% of E. superba were shallower (25-50 m). Younger stages of E. crystallorophias occurred more frequently (54% of F3s) in water > 100 m than older stages (11% of F6s). Thus, many larval E. crystallorophias were vertically segregated from E. superba, thereby reducing grazing competition between the young of these morphologically similar species.																	0722-4060					DEC	2004	28	1					72	81		10.1007/s00300-004-0660-y							WOS:000226552800008

In the present study, the diet of both species is compared in order to detect differences between them as well as to ascertain whether the krill consumed by both species might be pooled in single estimates of prey parameters. A nested ANOVA model was fitted to the dataset obtained in the seasons from 1997/1998 to 2005/2006. The overall variance was decomposed into variance components: within penguins (krill in stomachs), between penguins (means within each date), between dates (date means in each season), and between years (annual means). The within penguins component was similar in both species (18 % difference), while the between penguins was 64 % larger in Adelies. The within and between penguins variance components of both species showed consistent interannual changes. The annual means of both species differed significantly in three seasons, but not consistently. The sources of variance are tentatively attributed to biological characteristics: the within penguins component would reflect searching and feeding at the individual level; the between penguins might be associated with their foraging ranges, an assumption to be tested tracking individuals. Given their differences, the information from both species should be viewed as complementary and not be pooled.																	0722-4060					OCT	2012	35	10					1601	1606		10.1007/s00300-012-1201-8							WOS:000308331600014

Ideally, fermentation technology can be applied to transform them into a popular condiment. In addition to the exploration of protease properties, the present study aimed to evaluate proteinase activity, pH, amino nitrogen, and histamine formation during fermentation at different temperatures and salt treatments. RESULTS: Even though the activity of Antarctic krill protease reached a maximum at 40 degrees C and pH 7, it was stable at 30 degrees C and pH 7-9. Among the metal ions tested, Ca2+, Mg2+ and K+ increased protease activity, in contrast to Zn2+ and Cu2+. Within each treatment, the highest protease activity and amino nitrogen content, aswell as the lowest histamine level, were observed on day 12 of fermentation. Treatment at 35 degrees C with 180 g kg(-1) salt led to the production of maximum amino nitrogen (0.0352 g kg(-1)) and low histamine (<= 0.0497 g kg(-1)). CONCLUSION: Krill paste fermented for 12 days at 35 degrees C with 180 g kg(-1) salt exhibited the optimal quality and properties, suggesting an efficientmethod for fermentation of Antarctic krill and other aquatic resources.

In comparison with recent years the station grid was extended south, where a large proportion of small size classes, one-year-old juvenile krill was found. Results show a spatial separation of the juvenile krill and the spawning stock. Krill density was significantly higher than during the past years (229 krill 1000 m(-3) or 13.0 g m(-2)). The proportional recruitment index for the entire survey area for the 1999/2000 year class was R-1 = 0.573, which is among the highest values recorded during the past 20 years. The maturation index (based on the proportion of gravid stages) was G = 0.99, indicating an early initiation of the spawning season. The results indicate a turning point after a succession of years with poor recruitment success and low stock biomass. This is thought to be the first step for a successful spawning event and a later potential recruitment success of the 2000/01 year-class. The spatial extent of the station grid is discussed in the light of a representative coverage of the stock and the estimated recruitment index.																	0954-1020					JUN	2002	14	2					162	170		10.1017/S095410200200072X							WOS:000176315100008

Stored at 35 degreesC, it was evaluated the influence of water (a(w))(0.44, 0.53 and 0.75) on the pigments degradation (astaxantine). With a, of 0.75 pigments were better stabilized (p<0.05). It was also evaluated the effect of vacuum drying (-1,0 x 10(5) Pa) at temperatures of 50<degrees>, 55 degrees and 60 degreesC, on the degradation of pigments and unsaturated fatty acids. A drying temperature of 50 degreesC was optimum for the stabilization of carotene proteins during the storage.																	0001-9704	2339-9686				JAN-FEB	2001	57	491					49	53									WOS:000168230700010

A novel video analysis technique, applied to extract krill angle of orientation corresponding to each insonification, revealed that echo spectra from krill near broadside incidence relative to the incident acoustic wave exhibited widely spaced, deep nulls, whereas off-broadside echo spectra had a more erratic structure, with several closely spaced nulls of variable depth. The pattern of changes in echo spectra with orientation for the experimentally measured acoustic returns was very similar to theoretically predicted patterns based on a distorted wave Born approximation (DWBA) model. Information contained in the broadband echo spectra of the krill was exploited to invert the acoustic returns for angle of orientation by applying a newly developed Covariance Mean Variance Classification (CMVC) approach, using generic and animal-specific theoretical and empirical model spaces. The animal-specific empirical model space was best able to invert for angle of orientation. The CMVC inversion technique can be implemented using a generic empirical model space to determine angle of orientation based on broadband echoes from individual zooplankton in the field.

The analysis reviewed and updated krill density and proportional recruitment indices. Krill absolute recruitment and biomass from net sampling surveys are introduced as additional indices from this time series. New survey results from the past two seasons indicate a very successful 1994/1995 year-class and slightly below average proportional recruitment of the 1995/1996 krill year-class. Absolute recruitment of the 1995/1996 year-class was high compared to preceding years, because total stock size was relatively high in 1996/1997. After a period of low krill density and biomass in the area for almost a decade, krill density and biomass have increased. Caution is expressed as to whether this observed increase represents a long-term recovery of the stock.																	0722-4060					JUN	1998	19	6					393	398		10.1007/s003000050264							WOS:000073931800004

We respond to the technical criticisms made by Hill et al. (2019) of our work. We include a section where we suggest some approaches to help build consensus on detecting ecological trends in the Southern Ocean in the future. These approaches include: integrated assessments incorporating all relevant data, utilising data that will become available in the future from emerging technologies, and suggestions of other potential population monitoring methods that may be effective for krill.																	0278-0372	1937-240X				MAY	2019	39	3					323	327		10.1093/jcbiol/ruz010							WOS:000469782300015

The overall distributional patterns of different sizes and maturity stages demonstrated a seasonal progression of those observed in the Antarctic Peninsula region during November-December, 1987 by Siegel (1989). The krill sampled at each island site represented different size-maturity groups and demonstrated different horizontal and vertical distributional characteristics. These distributional differences may be related to the demographic differences and/or hydrographic differences between the two sites.																	0722-4060					APR	1993	13	3					171	181									WOS:A1993KW02000005

In the current study, destabilization of the medial meniscus (DMM) mouse model was used to investigate the effects of Antarctic krill peptides (AKP) on cartilage protection. As observed, AKP clearly ameliorate cartilage degeneration as evidenced by increased cartilage thickness and cartilage area and decreased histological Osteoarthritis Research Society International (OARSI) scores. Toluidine blue staining showed that AKO remarkably inhibited the loss of cartilage matrix in mice with OA. Hypoxia-inducible factor-2 alpha (HIF-2 alpha) has a key role in catabolic regulation and inflammation cascades which are the main causes of OA. AKP can down-regulate the expression of HIF-2 alpha and its downstream genes such as MMP-13, Adamts-S, IL-1 beta, iNOS, CXCL-1, and NOS2. Consistent with this, anabolic genes such as Acan and Col2 alpha 1 were restored after treatment with AKP. Chondrocyte apoptosis and the reduction in cartilage cell viability are also involved in the process of OA. The HIF-2 alpha-mediated death receptor apoptosis signaling pathway has been involved in the regulation of chondrocyte apoptosis. AKP can reduce the expressions of key pro-apoptosis genes in Fas-FasL and DR3-DR3L signaling pathways such as Fas, FasL, FADD, caspase8, caspase3, DR3, DR3L, RIP, and NF-kappa B. In addition, expressions of antiapoptosis genes such as c-AIP and c-FLIP were increased significantly. These findings indicate that AKP can be used as a new functional factor in the development of functional foods and chondroprotective drugs.																	0021-8561	1520-5118				MAR 20	2019	67	11					3125	3133		10.1021/acs.jafc.8b05841							WOS:000462260500007	30798606

Fluorine accumulation in Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar), Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua), rainbow trout (Onchorhyncus mykiss) and Atlantic halibut (Hippoglossus hippoglossus) fed diets with krill or amphipod meals and fish meal based diets with sodium fluoride (NaF) inclusion	AQUACULTURE												Meals produced from different marine invertebrate species have been suggested as good alternative protein sources in fish diets. The aim of this study was to evaluate the possible uptake of fluorine from krill (Thysanoessa inermis and Euphausia superba) and the amphipod Themisto libelulla in fish fed diets where the fish protein was partly or fully substituted with proteins from krill meal or amphipod meal. Feeding trials with Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar), Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua), rainbow trout (Onchorhyncus mykiss) and Atlantic halibut (Hippoglossus hippoglossus) were carried out, and fluorine were analysed in different organs, including muscle, bone and faeces as well as experimental diets and meals. Ampbipod meal had the highest fluorine level (4000:3800 mg kg(-1)), while meal from Thysanoessa inermis and Euphausia superba showed about one fourth of that level (780 +/- 160 mg kg(-1) and 1160 +/- 230 mg kg(-1), respectively). The fluorine concentration increased in the diets with increasing substitution of fish meal with krill or amphipod meal. Fluorine also increased in faeces with increasing fluorine levels in the diets. None of the analysed organs showed any increase in fluorine concentration compared to the control fish which was fed a diet with only fish meal as protein source. All four species were also fed a fish meal based diet where sodium fluoride (NaF) was added (150 mg F ka(-1) dry wt.). Again no organs showed any increase in fluorine levels. Growth and health parameters were not negatively altered. This indicates that the four fish species, when kept in a marine environment, were not affected by relatively high dietary fluorine level.

This study describes the preparation of protein isolates from oysters (OPI and HOPI) and krill (KPI and HKPI) by isoelectric solubilisation/precipitation (ISP) with or without heat pretreatment and comparatively presents their characteristics. The results showed that the solubilities of HOPI (24.08 +/- 1.94%) and HKPI (42.29 +/- 0.78%) were higher than those of OPI (13.46 +/- 0.78%) and KPI (21.71.46 +/- 1.51%), and the free and total sulphhydryl (-SH) content and surface hydrophobicity of HOPI and HKPI were higher than those of OPI and KPI, which are related to higher fat content of HOPI (10.37 +/- 0.55%) and HKPI (34.89 +/- 1.19%). SDS-PAGE and gel chromatography pattern results showed that macromolecular proteins were degraded by endogenous enzymes in OPI and KPI, while they remained unaffected in HOPI and HKPI. The FT-IR spectra showed similar patterns between OPI and HOPI and between KPI and HKPI. While the essential amino acid content was similar for OPI and HOPI (47.06 +/- 1.33% and 47.93 +/- 1.02%), that of KPI and HKPI (50.89 +/- 0.89% and 51.19 +/- 1.11%, respectively) was not significantly different.																	0950-5423	1365-2621				FEB	2021	56	2					682	691		10.1111/ijfs.14702		AUG 2020					WOS:000563908600001

Ecological niche modeling of sympatric krill predators around Marguerite Bay, Western Antarctic Peninsula	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY												Adelie penguins (Pygoscelis adeliae), carabeater seals (Lobodon carcinophagus), humpback (Megaptera novaeangliae), and minke whales (Balaenoptera bonaernsis) are found in the waters surrounding the Western Antarctic Peninsula. Each species relies primarily on Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) and has physiological constraints and foraging behaviors that dictate their ecological niches. Understanding the degree of ecological overlap between sympatric krill predators is critical to understanding and predicting the impacts on climate-driven changes to the Antarctic marine ecosystem. To explore ecological relationships amongst sympatric krill predators, we developed ecological niche models using a maximum entropy modeling approach (Maxent) that allows the integration of data collected by a variety of means (e.g. satellite-based locations and visual observations). We created spatially explicit probability distributions for the four krill predators in fall 2001 and 2002 in conjunction with a suite of environmental variables. We find areas within Marguerite Bay with high krill predator occurrence rates or biological hot spots. We find the modeled ecological niches for Adelie penguins and crabeater seals may be affected by their physiological needs to haul-out on substrate. Thus, their distributions may be less dictated by proximity to prey and more so by physical features that over time provide adequate access to prey. Humpback and minke whales, being fully marine and having greater energetic demands, occupy ecological niches more directly proximate to prey. We also find evidence to suggest that the amount of overlap between modeled niches is relatively low, even for species with similar energetic requirements. In a rapidly changing and variable environment, our modeling work shows little indication that krill predators maintain similar ecological niches across years around Marguerite Bay. Given the amount of variability in the marine environment around the Antarctic Peninsula and how this affects the local abundance of prey, there may be consequences for krill predators with historically little niche overlap to increase the potential for interspecific competition for shared prey resources.

J	HUNTLEY, ME; NIILER, PP				HUNTLEY, ME; NIILER, PP			PHYSICAL CONTROL OF POPULATION-DYNAMICS IN THE SOUTHERN-OCEAN	ICES JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE												Horizontal advection is the single most important mechanism by which physics of the Southern Ocean exerts control on population dynamics of its resident zooplankton. Advection determines whether or not zooplankton will reside in food-poor areas (e.g. Antarctic Circumpolar Current) or in food-rich areas (e.g. coastal shelves and frontal zones); the shape and structure of advective features further determine the residence time of zooplankton in a given food regime. Advection per se thus bears directly on rates of growth, mortality, and reproduction. The intensity of advection on characteristic spatial scales in the Southern Ocean redistributes zooplankton to such a great degree that it utterly destroys the demographic integrity of populations. The spatial scale of advective features, determined by the internal Rossby radius, is much smaller in the Southern Ocean (order 5 km) than at lower latitudes. At the same time, the life cycle of Antarctic zooplankton is relatively long; copepods typically have a one-year life cycle, and that of krill is longer. A group of zooplankton that begins its life cycle as an identifiable population is subjected to the small-scale dispersive forces of advection for such a long time that by the time individual members reach maturity they will have been dispersed to such a great degree that they are no longer recognizable as a single population. We conclude that the nature of physical control of zooplankton population dynamics in the Southern Ocean calls into question the very concept of a population.

J	Demer, DA; Conti, SG				Demer, DA; Conti, SG			New target-strength model indicates more krill in the Southern Ocean	ICES JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE												Antarctic krill, Eaphausia superba, comprises the foundation of the foodweb in the Southern Ocean and is the target of a large fishery. Recently, the total abundance of krill in the Scotia Sea was estimated from an international echosounder and net survey (CCAMLR 2000) to be 44.3 million metric tonnes (Mt; CV 11.4%) (Hewitt et al., 2002). The new biomass estimate prompted the Antarctic Treaty's Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR) to revise the precautionary catch level for krill in the area from 1.5 to 4 Mt (SC-CAMLR, 2000). These survey results are based on the total echo energy attributed to krill, scaled by the Greene et al. (1991) model of krill acoustical reflectivity or target strength (TS). Presented here is a re-analysis of the CCAMLR 2000 data incorporating recent improvements in the characterization of krill TS. The results indicate that the estimated krill biomass in the Scotia Sea may be as high as 192.4 Mt (CV = 11.7%), or as low as 109.4 Mt (CV = 10.4%), depending solely on the expected distribution of krill orientations. The new Stochastic, Distorted-Wave, Born-Approximation (SDWBA) TS model solved with an empirically estimated distribution of in situ orientations leads to a krill-biomass estimate that is nearly 2.5 times the previous estimate. In consequence, revisions may be warranted of the standard krill TS model, the CCAMLR 2000 biomass estimate, and the associated precautionary catch level for krill in the Scotia Sea.

The survey progressed from 80 degrees E in late January to 150 degrees E in mid March. Krill varied in mean size across the survey area, and the Various maturity stages showed some longitudinal and latitudinal trends. Males, early stage females, and juveniles were, on average, larger in the east of the survey area whereas gravid and spent females differed little in length across the survey area. Gravid females were only found north of the shelf break; juveniles, males and other stages of females were found throughout the latitudinal extent of the survey. Growth rate measurements resulted in comparable figures to other studies in the Indian Ocean and were greatest in February for all stages. Observed growth rates were sufficient to account for the changes in mean sizes of krill observed across the survey area. The mean density of krill revealed by nets (2.65 krill per 1000 m(-3)) was low compared to other areas that have been surveyed. Similarly, the overall estimates of proportional recruitment were below average when compared to the range of reported values. Krill larvae were moderately abundant in the survey area but were more frequently encountered in the east, which is probably a function of the lateness of the season when the larvae would be rising into the surface layer sampled by the net.

J	Quiroz, JC; Wiff, R; Barrientos, MA; Contreras, F				Carlos Quiroz, Juan; Wiff, Rodrigo; Barrientos, Mauricio A.; Contreras, Francisco			Discrimination of environmental variables that influence the catch per unit effort: the case of the Antarctic krill fishery	LATIN AMERICAN JOURNAL OF AQUATIC RESEARCH												The use of the catch per unit effort (CPUE) as an index of abundance usually requires a standardization process consisting of isolating all those exogenous factors from temporal variations in abundance from the CPUE time-series. These exogenous factors include those generated by modifications in fishery vessel efficiency, variations in fishing strategies, and environmental fluctuations. The selection of the latter has been considered to be one of the most difficult, arbitrary, and poorly documented stages since the environmental effects vary on different temporal scales in autocorrelated and non-random manners, influencing the CPUE through a cause-effect process. Transfer function models (TFM) were constructed to describe statistically the cause-effect relationship between two time-series and herein we propose that TFM are a valid tool for: i) discriminating environmental effects that influence the CPUE and ii) describing how these effects should be included in a generalized lineal model (GLM). We analyzed the Antarctic krill CPUE from August 1989 to July 1999, and as possible causal effects, the Antarctic Oscillation Index (AOI) and atmospheric pressure at sea level (APSL). TFM shows that the APSL, with an annual lag (APSL12), influences the CPUE of Antarctic krill, whereas the AOI did not have a significant effect. The use of APSL12 in the GLM increased the explanation of the deviance by 31% as compared with the APSL with no lag. We concluded that TFM constitute a promising tool for including environmental effects in the standardization of the CPUE that would result in less biased and more accurate indexes of abundance.																	0718-560X	0717-7178					2011	39	1					71	81		10.3856/vol39-issue1-fulltext-7							WOS:000288178700007						
J	Reid, K; Murphy, EJ; Loeb, V; Hewitt, RP				Reid, K; Murphy, EJ; Loeb, V; Hewitt, RP			Krill population dynamics in the Scotia Sea: variability in growth and mortality within a single population	JOURNAL OF MARINE SYSTEMS												Understanding the demographics of Antarctic krill over large scales may be complicated by regional differences in the processes that govern population structure. The influence of regional differences in growth and mortality on population size structure was examined using data on the length-frequency distribution of krill in the Scotia Sea using samples from the South Shetland Islands and South Georgia collected annually from 1991 to 2000. A correction function, which took account of the higher growth rate at South Georgia, produced a consistent similarity in the position of the modal size classes that was not present in the raw data. Optimising the mortality rate, to minimise the differences in the growth corrected length-frequency distribution, suggested a higher mortality rate at South Georgia that the South Shetlands. The intra-specific variations in growth and mortality rates are consistent with published values and with other Euphausiids species. Having accounted for the demographic plasticity, it is apparent that strong recruitment of the smallest size class of krill is represented in both populations simultaneously. It appears that first-year krill are advected into different regions of the Scotia Sea where the resultant population size structure is determined by regional differences in growth and mortality. The majority of the commercial harvest of krill in the Antarctic occurs in a relatively small number of regional fisheries within the Scotia Sea and is managed using population models based on a single set of demographic parameters. Where substantial differences in these parameters exist between fishing areas, the calculation of catch limits should take these differences into account. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Modeling Antarctic Krill Circumpolar Spawning Habitat Quality to Identify Regions With Potential to Support High Larval Production	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS												Antarctic krill (krill) are important within Southern Ocean ecosystems and support an expanding fishery. Toward understanding krill's response to environmental change, it is necessary to identify regions that support high krill larval production (spawning habitat). We develop a mechanistic model combining thermal and food requirements for krill egg production, with predation pressure post-spawning, to predict regions of high-quality spawning habitat. We optimize our model regionally and generate circumpolar predictions of spawning habitat quality. Our results indicate the southwest Atlantic accounts for almost half of all predicted high-quality spawning habitat. Small-scale management units (SSMUs) around the Antarctic Peninsula had high coverage of high-quality spawning habitat. In contrast, the remaining SSMUs (except around South Georgia) were poorly covered, suggestive of population sinks reliant on input from external sources upstream. This implies strong potential for downstream impacts of fishing in key spawning areas, with implications for management of SSMUs and the krill fishery.

Herein, a lipidomics method for in situ monitoring of the dynamic oxidation characteristics in AKO was explored based on electric soldering iron ion source (ESII) coupling with rapid evaporative ionization mass spectrometry (REIMS). The lipidomics profiles of AKO at different storage periods were successfully acquired. On the basis of principal component analysis and orthogonal partial least-squares analysis, the obtained REIMS data were employed to build a multivariate recognition model. The ions of m/z 707.50, 721.50, 833.49, and 837.54 contributed the most significant effect on the multivariate data model for the authentication of different AKO samples. Besides, the variation of viscosity, astaxanthin, and volatile compounds were also evaluated to corroborate the oxidation characteristics. The results indicated that the ESII-REIMS technology could be applied as an advanced rapid detection method to secure oil and fat quality during storage.

Maturation and spawning were induced after the light : dark (L : D) cycle was increased from 8 : 16 or 12 : 12 to 24 : 0, or when the L : D cycle was held constant at 14 : 10. This study is one of the first studies that demonstrate initiation of maturation and spawning events of krill under controlled photoperiod. Out of three experimental batches of krill, a total of 28 spawning events were observed. The mean number of eggs per event was 1424 with a range between 139 and 3458. The mean hatching success per batch was 19.1%. The relation between photoperiod and maturity/spawning is discussed. Furthermore, hatching is compared to previous studies and the reason for the low success is discussed.

Krill were concentrated within a band under ice between 1 and 13 kilometers south of the ice edge. Within this band, krill densities were fivefold greater than that of open water. The under-ice environment has tong been considered an important habitat for krill, but sampling difficulties have previously prevented direct observations under ice over the scale necessary for robust krill density estimation. Autosub-2 enabled us to make continuous high-resolution measurements of krill density under ice reaching 27 kilometers beyond the ice edge.

There were correlations between percentage IMP-1 and the concentration (gram: gram dry weight) of the diatom biomarker fatty acids, 16: 4(n-1) and 20: 5(n-3) in tissues of individual krill, suggesting that the abundance of diatoms in the environment of the krill in the intermoult period prior to moulting was a key determinant of change in body length, a proxy for growth. This substantiates the view that diatoms are crucial for supporting high growth rates of krill, either as a direct food source or, indirectly, by enhancing production of microzooplankton and mesozooplankton based food webs.																	0024-3590					MAR	2005	50	2					732	736		10.4319/lo.2005.50.2.0732							WOS:000227835200034

Amino Acid and Mineral Composition of Protein and Other Components and Their Recovery Yields from Whole Antarctic Krill (Euphausia superba) Using Isoelectric Solubilization/Precipitation	JOURNAL OF FOOD SCIENCE												Proteins and insolubles were recovered from whole Antarctic krill via novel isoelectric solubilization/precipitation using different pH treatments. The protein recovery yield was 45% to 50% ( dry basis). The recovered proteins had higher (P < 0.05) content of essential amino acids (EAAs) and non-EAAs as well as higher ( P < 0.05) ratio of total EAA/total AA than whole krill. The EAAs constituted almost 50% of total AAs. The least extreme pH treatments (pHs 3 and 12) yielded highest ( P < 0.05) content of EAAs. The quality of recovered proteins was high based on EAAs meeting FAO/WHO/UNU recommendations for adults and infants. The basic pH yielded proteins with the lowest (P < 0.05) amount of minerals and the highest (P < 0.05) amount of Ca, P, and Mg in the insolubles when compared to the acidic treatments. However, both basic and acidic treatments effectively removed minerals from recovered proteins without the removal of the exoskeleton before processing. Therefore, besides high-quality proteins, the insolubles may provide a mineral supplement in the animal diet.

During the present study, krill protein hydrolysates (KPH) were prepared using several proteases, optimizing reaction time for dose-response analysis of antioxidant activity. Bioassay-guided fractionation of selected KPH of pepsin, first by ultrafiltration ( < 1 kDa, 1-3 kDa, and > 3 kDa), revealed the active fraction, 1-3 kDa, which was consecutively separated by ion-exchange chromatography and stepwise RP-HPLC. Three peptides were identified, sequenced and synthesized. The peptide P2 was effective in reducing H2O2-induced oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation by increasing antioxidant enzyme activities, including superoxide dismutase, catalase, and glutathione peroxidase. P2 reduced apoptosis in H2O2 -stimulated hepatocytes by regulating the expression levels of Bcl-2/Bax and caspase-3. P2 pre-treatment increased nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1) expression in cultured hepatocytes. Furthermore, P2 induced the activation of Nrf2/HO-1 by activating the ERK pathway.

Results showed that PP-AKP significantly improved bone turnover status, reduced bone loss and degeneration of microarchitecture, in addition to accelerated bone formation. Further mechanism investigation revealed that PP-AKP suppressed the mRNA expression of MKP-1 and CB1, which activated the downstream osteogenesis-related MAPKs and PI3K/AKT/GSK-3 beta signaling pathways through elevation of the expression of the key factors p38, ERK, PI3K, AKT and beta-catenin, in addition to osteogenic nuclear transcription factors Runx2 and OSX. Additionally, reduction in number of adipocytes and an increase in trabeculae in the bone marrow cavity, in addition to a decrease in abdominal adipose further verified that PP-AKP augmented bone formation with a comparable reduction in the accumulation of fat. In conclusion, PP-AKP ameliorated osteoporosis via promoting MAPKs and PI3K/AKT/GSK-3 beta pathways related to bone formation in dexamethasone-treated mice.																	1756-4646					AUG	2018	47						447	456		10.1016/j.jff.2018.06.004							WOS:000439019200048

Emphasis is given to the initiation of the CCAMLR Ecosystem Monitoring Program (CEMP) and the deliberations of the Working Group on Krill (WG-Krill). Particular prominence is also attached to the modelling approach developed in order to calculate a precautionary catch limit for the krill fishery in various CCAMLR statistical areas.

It has been ascertained that krill migrations occur between sea surface and a depth of about 100 m. Availability of food is the key factor affecting both seasonal and annual changes, and leads to krill migration. Under good feeding conditions the amplitude is maximal, and the migration cycle approaches 24 h. Adult individuals exhibit 24 h migration, whereas juveniles show lower migration, and their submergence is shallower. Water stratification may also affect krill distribution in the water column, and in certain conditions may lead to limitation of migration range.																	0011-3891					NOV 25	2005	89	10					1749	1753									WOS:000233736400025

The apparent lack of a locally self-maintaining krill population at South Georgia means that understanding the mechanism underlying these observed population characteristics is essential to successful ecosystem-based management of krill fishery in the region. Krill acoustic-density data from surveys conducted in the early, middle and late period of the summers of 2001 to 2005, together with krill population size structure over the same period from predator diet data, were used with a krill population dynamics model to evaluate potential mechanisms behind the observed changes in krill biomass. Krill abundance was highest during the middle of the summer in 3 years and in the late period in 2 years; in the latter there was evidence that krill recruitment was delayed by several months. A model scenario that included empirically derived estimates of both the magnitude and timing of recruitment in each year showed the greatest correlation with the acoustic series. The results are consistent with a krill population with allochthonous recruitment entering a retained adult population; i.e. oceanic transport of adult krill does not appear to be the major factor determining the dynamics of the adult population. The results highlight the importance of the timing of recruitment, especially where this could introduce a mismatch between the peak of krill abundance and the peak demand from predators, which may exacerbate the effects of changes in krill populations arising from commercial harvesting and/or climate change.

The phylogenetic reconstructions indicated that the Antarctic species form a monophyletic clade separated by the non-Antarctic species. The results revealed a large genetic divergence between the Antarctic (E. superba and E. crystallorophias) and sub-Antarctic species (E. vallentini). The time of separation between these species, estimated from the molecular data, is around 20 million years ago, which is comparable with the geological time of the formation of a circum-Antarctic water circulation and the Antarctic Polar Frontal Zone.

Scaling of size, shape and surface roughness in Antarctic krill swarms	ICES JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE												Antarctic krill are obligate swarmers and the size and shape of the swarms they form can have a major influence on trophic interactions and biogeochemical fluxes. Parameterizing variability in size and shape is therefore a useful step toward understanding the operation of the Southern Ocean ecosystem. We analyse the relationships between the length L, thickness T, perimeter P, and area A of 4650 vertical cross-sections of open-ocean krill swarms obtained within the Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean in summer 2003. Our data show that these parameters are tightly interrelated. The thickness T increases on average as L0.67 and has a log-normal distribution within each length class. The perimeter and area scale with L and T as P similar to L0.77T and A similar to L0.86T0.48. The swarm aspect ratio, T/L, decreases approximately as L-0.32. The surface roughness (defined as P/A) has a weak dependence on swarm length and decreases approximately as T-0.46, which can be explained only by the appearance of indentations and cavities in the swarm shape. Overall, our study finds that there are distinct limits to the size and shape of swarms that Antarctic krill appear to be capable of forming and we explore the potential explanatory factors contributing to these limitations.

Conventional and molecular analysis of the diet of gentoo penguins: contributions to assess scats for non-invasive penguin diet monitoring	POLAR BIOLOGY												There is a growing search for less invasive methods while studying the diet of Antarctic animals in the wild. Therefore, we compared the diet of gentoo penguins from stomach contents (i.e. through visual identification of prey remains) and scats (i.e. faeces), and further compared prey DNA assay in fresh and old scats. Prey remains identified visually in stomach contents and scats were broadly comparable: the crustaceans and fish were the most important components, with Themisto gaudichaudii clearly being the most frequent and numerous prey species in both sampling methods. By mass, differences in species frequency were observed in stomach contents (Parachaenichthys georgianus) and scats (Champsocephalus gunnari), with the former fish species absent in scats. Differences were detected in the most frequent prey (T. gaudichaudii and Euphausia superba) and in various fish species, most with bigger sizes in scats. Allometric equations to estimate most crustacean's sizes (i.e. relationships between carapace and mass/total length) are needed. For DNA studies, when comparing DNA from fresh and old scats, both provided similar results that, in general, were also similar to the visual analysis. In order to use penguin scats (along with the use of DNA analyses) for monitoring purposes, allometric equations to estimate mass and size of prey (most crustaceans) and better designed species-specific primers are needed for targeting key prey species (e.g. Euphausia superba, T. gaudichaudii). These DNA methodologies can complement other methods (i.e. visual analyses and stomach contents analyses) in monitoring programs of penguins.

Identifying sea-ice characteristics that serve as indicators of habitat quality will be crucial to the monitoring and management of climate change impacts. In the Southern Ocean, Antarctic krill is a key prey species and fishery target. Krill larvae depend upon sea-ice habitats to survive the winter and recruit to the population in spring. Existing observations of sea-ice characteristics lack sufficient spatiotemporal coverage to quantify which ones contribute to favourable overwintering habitat, leading to uncertainties in how current and future changes in sea ice affect krill populations. Here, we derive regional-scale indices of annual krill recruitment spanning 35 years across the southwest Atlantic. To develop meaningful indicators of sea-ice habitat, we selected variables from a high-resolution sea-ice model that are hypothesized as relevant for larval habitat use. The resulting correlations between recruitment and sea-ice indicators vary by region and show remote connections to sea ice that correspond with established theories of larval transport. Through an improved representation of sea-ice habitat quality, as compared with using more traditional satellite-derived variables such as sea-ice extent and duration, we highlight plausible regions of overwintering habitat. Our findings improve current understanding of how krill are likely responding to changing sea ice and support emerging views that larval habitat use is complex. Furthermore, regional variation in larval dependence on sea ice may provide pockets of resilience to change for the broader krill population.																	1470-160X	1872-7034				OCT	2021	129								107934	10.1016/j.ecolind.2021.107934							WOS:000681691400001

Internal physiology of live krill revealed using new aquaria techniques and mixed optical microscopy and optical coherence tomography ( OCT) imaging techniques	MARINE AND FRESHWATER BEHAVIOUR AND PHYSIOLOGY												The accurate observation of physiological changes on in vivo samples of important animal species such as Euphausia superba (Antarctic krill) is an important goal in helping to understand how environmental changes can affect animal development. Using a custom made krill trap', live un-anaesthetized krill were confined for seven hours, during which three hours of optical imaging were obtained and no subsequent ill effects observed. The trap enabled two imaging methods to be employed: optical coherence tomography (OCT) and microscopy. OCT enabled internal structure and tissues to be imaged to a depth of approximately 2mm and resolution of approximately 12m. Microscopy was used to observe heart rate. During our experiments, we imaged a range of internal structures in live animals including the heart and gastric areas. The trap design enables a new generation of mixed modality imaging of these animals in vivo. These techniques will enable detailed studies of the internal physiology of live krill to be undertaken under a wide range of environmental conditions and have the potential to highlight important variations in behaviour and animal development.

One solution is to integrate data without any threshold and then remove background noise during post-processing. Unthresholded, integrated data of micronekton and Euphausia superba collected with a SIMRAD EK500 at frequencies of 38 and 120 kHz are presented. The underlying background noise level follows a 20 log R + 2 alpha R relationship, which can be scaled to the minimum volume backscatter (Sv) in each layer during a transect and then subtracted from the entire data set to remove background noise. The utility of this procedure is demonstrated by making comparisons of Sv at each frequency and investigating the effect of noise removal on the identification of targets based on the dB difference (120 kHz Sv-38 kHz Sv).

In the present work, those compounds were analysed in unhatched penguin eggs and whole krill collected in Admiralty Bay, King George Island, Antarctica in the austral summers of 2004-2005 and 2005-2006. The compounds found in higher levels (in a wet weight basis) were, in most of the egg samples, the PCBs (2.53-78.7 ng g(-1)), DDTs (2.07-38.0 ng g(-1)) and HCB (4.99-39.1 ng g(-1)) and after Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA, the occurrence seemed to be species-specific for the Pygoscelis genus. In all of the cases, the levels found were not higher than the ones in Arctic birds in a similar trophic level. The krill samples analysis allowed estimating the biomagnification factors (which resulted in up to 363 for HCB, one order of magnitude higher than DDTs and chlordanes and two orders of magnitude higher than the other groups) of the compounds found in eggs, whose only source of contamination is the female-offspring transfer.

J	Jackowski, E				Jackowski, E			Distribution and size of Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba Dana) in Polish commercial catches taken in the Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean from 1997 to 1999	CCAMLR SCIENCE												The distribution and internal structure of commercial krill concentrations were investigated in the areas of the South Shetland, Elephant, South Georgia and South Orkney Islands in the spring and summer from 1997 to 1999. The density of concentrations varied with area and season. The densest concentrations were found near the South Shetlands. Concentrations at night were several times less dense than those observed during the day. Between February and April the density of concentrations increased, while in May and June it decreased. From February to June the period of daylight becomes progressively shorter, therefore it must be assumed that there are factors other than daylight which have an impact on the density of krill concentrations. The internal structure of concentrations was very diverse, and mean density varied from 11 to 31 370 specimens per 1000 m(3). At night, krill concentrations were scattered throughout the water column, however no clear evidence of vertical migrations was found. Between February and April concentrations occurred in much shallower waters at night than during the day, while in May and June they occurred at the same depths at night as during the day or sometimes even deeper. Between February and April concentrations during the day were found in shallower waters, while between April and June they were found in deeper waters. The size structure of the krill varied during all periods and in all areas, however krill size was observed to decrease as the season progressed.																	1023-4063						2002	9						83	105									WOS:000179438500007

The importance of Antarctic krill in biogeochemical cycles	NATURE COMMUNICATIONS												Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) are swarming, oceanic crustaceans, up to two inches long, and best known as prey for whales and penguins - but they have another important role. With their large size, high biomass and daily vertical migrations they transport and transform essential nutrients, stimulate primary productivity and influence the carbon sink. Antarctic krill are also fished by the Southern Ocean's largest fishery. Yet how krill fishing impacts nutrient fertilisation and the carbon sink in the Southern Ocean is poorly understood. Our synthesis shows fishery management should consider the influential biogeochemical role of both adult and larval Antarctic krill.

The results showed that the population was heterogeneous with respect to size and maturity, with small immature krill found primarily inside the Bransfield Strait and large mature krill mainly north of the South Shetland Islands. Multivariate analysis of hydrographic data collected at the same stations revealed that the oceanography corresponded to previous classifications of the area, with Weddell Sea water in the southeast and east and South East Pacific water in the northwest. Further multivariate analysis using both krill variability and hydrographic data showed that a strong correlation existed between the krill distribution and the oceanography. Several hypotheses to explain the observed distribution of krill are discussed. It is judged that neither simple processes, such as growth during the sampling period, nor processes whereby krill are advected passively through the area by water movement, can completely explain the observed distribution. Instead, it is concluded that the observed gradient of krill size and maturity probably arises, at least in part, from an active ontogenetic migration.																	0171-8630					AUG	1993	98	1-2					61	71		10.3354/meps098061							WOS:A1993LT15100006

Distribution, density and relative abundance of Antarctic krill estimated by maximum likelihood geostatistics on acoustic data collected during commercial fishing operations	FISHERIES RESEARCH												There is a substantial harvest for Antarctic krill in the Southern Ocean, but little regular scientific monitoring of the resource. Recently, however, the Commission for the Conservation of Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR) has initialised a process to make use of acoustic data from commercial fisheries to increase the amount of relevant information available for making management decisions. We here provide an example where 34 days of acoustic data, collected during commercial krill fishing operations on the vessel 'Saga Sea' were processed to produce probability of presence, conditional density and relative abundance estimates on monthly, weekly and daily basis. Data were analyzed using a maximum likelihood time-series and geostatistical approaches, selected to account for the lack of sampling design, and likely correlation in space and time. The applied method showed low sensitivity of monthly estimates to different repeated measure criteria and location sub-settings. Most weekly estimates, but the last one, were also consistent with the full data (monthly) estimate. Highly variable and lower estimates were obtained, however, from daily data sets. Although our results suggest the method had provided an adequate treatment for time and space correlation, we were not able to evaluate potential bias due to preferential sampling of high density krill aggregations and/or limited area coverage within short time periods. The results suggest that this method, combined with some additional design based coverage by the fishing vessels, can be useful to obtain quantitative evaluations of krill density and distribution for management purposes.

J	Willis, J				Willis, Jay			Could whales have maintained a high abundance of krill?	EVOLUTIONARY ECOLOGY RESEARCH												Question: Several million large whales were killed between 1900 and 1970. All these whales preyed on krill (Euphausia superba). Why has krill population abundance declined after the elimination of their primary predator? Hypothesis: Krill have changed their behaviour due to the absence of whales and this change in behaviour has resulted in a decrease in krill abundance. Methods: I reproduced a computer model of krill life history. I then extended the model as an individual-based model to show the effects of habitat choice on individual lifetime reproductive success and abundance. Conclusions: In the context of our current understanding of krill physiology, predator-invoked behaviour may lead to increased population abundance and, without the predator, natural selection may favour behaviour that would lead to lower abundance. This reverses the predictions of mass balance ecosystem models.					Willis, Jay/0000-0003-0701-7262												1522-0613					MAY	2007	9	4					651	662									WOS:000247437000006

Phylogenetic analysis of several Antarctic and sub-Antarctic Euphausia species indicates the importance of dispersal in determining the present-day geographic distribution. Dating speciation events suggest that the formation of the Antarctic Convergence, the oceanographic barrier isolating the Southern Ocean, may have played a role in separating the ancestral Antarctic and sub-Antarctic lineages. Intraspecific data show that the Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) is characterized by weak genetic differentiation, whereas the northern krill (Meganyctiphanes norvegica) is more structured showing discrete genetic pools. This difference can be explained, at least partly, by the oceanographic conditions in the areas inhabited by the two species.

Previous studies have postulated that the krill cycle is induced by periodic climatological factors, but these postulated drivers neither show consistent agreement, nor are they supported by quantitative models. Here, using data analysis complemented with modelling of krill ontogeny and population dynamics, we identify intraspecific competition for food as the main driver of the krill cycle, while external climatological factors possibly modulate its phase and synchronization over large scales. Our model indicates that the cycle amplitude increases with reduction of krill loss rates. Thus, a decline of apex predators is likely to increase the oscillation amplitude, potentially destabilizing the marine food web, with drastic consequences for the entire Antarctic ecosystem.

J	Tarling, GA; Thorpe, SE				Tarling, Geraint A.; Thorpe, Sally E.			Oceanic swarms of Antarctic krill perform satiation sinking	PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES												Antarctic krill form some of the highest concentrations of animal biomass observed in the world's oceans potentially due to their prolific ability to swarm. Determining the movement of Antarctic krill within swarms is important to identify drivers of their behaviour and their biogeochemical impact on their environment. We examined vertical velocity within approximately 2000 krill swarms through the combined use of a shipborne echosounder and an acoustic Doppler current profiler. We revealed a pronounced downward anomaly in vertical velocity within swarms of -0.6 cm s(-1) compared with vertical motion outside the swarm. The anomaly changed over the diel cycle, with smaller downward anomalies occurring at night. Swarms in regions of high phytoplankton concentrations (a proxy for food availability) also exhibited significantly smaller downward anomalies. We propose that the anomaly is the result of downward velocities generated by the action of krill beating their swimming appendages. During the night and in high phytoplankton availability, when krill are more likely to feed to the point of satiation, swimming activity is lowered and the anomaly is reduced. Our findings are consistent with laboratory work where krill ceased swimming and adopted a parachute posture when sated. Satiation sinking behaviour can substantially increase the efficiency of carbon transport to depth through depositing faecal pellets at the bottom of swarms, avoiding the reingestion and break-up of pellets by other swarm members.

Spatial distributions of two species of krill (ice and Antarctic krill) were estimated by GAMs. Three abiotic factors distance from the continental shelf break (800m isobaths), the mean temperature and salinity from the surface to 200m (MTEM-200 and MSAL-200), and latitude and longitude were used as covariates for models of krill. Estimated spatial distributions of krill were then used with other covariates to model the spatial distribution of Antarctic minke whales. In the selected model of Antarctic minke whales, Antarctic krill were more influential than ice krill. The number of Antarctic minke whales increased as the density of Antarctic krill increased to around 1.5gm2. Beyond that, the number of Antarctic minke whales decreased as the density of Antarctic krill increased. High densities of the Antarctic minke whales were estimated along the sea ice edge in the eastern part of the Ross Sea. Specifically, the densities were high in the north of the continental shelf break where low MTEM-200 and MSAL-200 and intermediate densities of Antarctic krill were observed. Further data collection is needed to investigate interannual variations and trends in their relationship. The results show that the spatial distribution of Antarctic minke whales is a function of longitude, distance from the shelf break, oceanographic condition (temperature and salinity), and densities of ice and Antarctic krill.

Bengtson			Turning microplastics into nanoplastics through digestive fragmentation by Antarctic krill	NATURE COMMUNICATIONS												Microplastics (plastics < 5mm diameter) are at the forefront of current environmental pollution research, however, little is known about the degradation of microplastics through ingestion. Here, by exposing Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) to microplastics under acute static renewal conditions, we present evidence of physical size alteration of microplastics ingested by a planktonic crustacean. Ingested microplastics (31.5 mu m) are fragmented into pieces less than 1 mu m in diameter. Previous feeding studies have shown spherical microplastics either; pass unaffected through an organism and are excreted, or are sufficiently small for translocation to occur. We identify a new pathway; microplastics are fragmented into sizes small enough to cross physical barriers, or are egested as a mixture of triturated particles. These findings suggest that current laboratory-based feeding studies may be oversimplifying interactions between zooplankton and microplastics but also introduces a new role of Antarctic krill, and potentially other species, in the biogeochemical cycling and fate of plastic.

J	McGaffin, AF; Nicol, S; Ritz, DA				McGaffin, AF; Nicol, S; Ritz, DA			Changes in muscle tissue of shrinking Antarctic krill	POLAR BIOLOGY												We examined the mechanism by which Antarctic krill, Euphausia superba, shrink, and suggest that cellular changes occurring during shrinkage may provide a means for identifying krill that have undergone shrinkage. We compared the muscle tissue of juvenile, adult and shrunken adult krill to identify changes in cell number associated with maturity and shrinkage. Comparison of the absolute number and density of nuclei in abdominal segments of juvenile, adult and shrunken adult krill revealed differences related to maturity and shrinkage. Shrunken adult krill had nearly twice as many nuclei per unit area than adult krill that had not shrunk. This suggests that krill shrink by a reduction in cell volume, rather than cell loss. This simply detected variation in muscle cell nucleus density may be useful in distinguishing shrunken adult krill from juveniles, and contribute to our knowledge of age structure in natural populations.																	0722-4060					MAR	2002	25	3					180	186		10.1007/s003000100325							WOS:000174713200003

Results are compared with aggregations detected in the Indian Ocean. Aggregations in the Atlantic were larger, closer to the surface and to each other than in the Indian Ocean. Similar patterns in the distribution of aggregation spacing along survey transects were found in the two areas, although the pattern of spacings in the Atlantic indicates differences in the scale of aggregation. Serial interdependence of aggregation variables was minimal in the Atlantic, with aggregation thickness, length and spacing showing weak inter-relationships. Weak functional association between water depth and aggregation thickness was evident. Investigation of variability in aggregation structure in relation to prevailing environmental conditions gave equivocal results and no clear association between any aggregation variable and prevailing hydrography was observed. The implications of these results for future studies on krill aggregation are discussed in relation to a conceptual framework which was developed from the present results and aimed at linking krill aggregation characteristics to environmental features.

J	Siegel, V; Harm, U				Siegel, V; Harm, U			The composition, abundance, biomass and diversity of the epipelagic zooplankton communities of the southern Bellingshausen Sea (Antarctic) with special reference to krill and salps	ARCHIVE OF FISHERY AND MARINE RESEARCH												Zooplankton was sampled in the southern Bellingshausen Sea with RMT 1+8 gear during austral summer 1994. A total of 121 zooplankton species were found. Although zooplankton diversity was high in oceanic and neritic waters, abundances and biomass were among the lowest recorded for Antarctic epipelagic zooplankton. Copepods and chaetognaths dominated numerically, while chaetognaths and krill Euphausia superba dominated in biomass wet weight. Salpa thompsoni occurred in low densities (median 0.1 to 0.4/1000 m(3)), although during the same period a mass development was recorded from the South Shetland Island region. Density values for Euphausia crystallorophias were in the same range as reported from the southern Weddell Sea. Krill, Euphausia superba, biomass was lower than generally found in the Antarctic Peninsula and Elephant Island region. A distinct spatial separation for size groups was observed for salps, Euphausia crystallorophias and krill. Small salp size groups dominated in the East Wind Drift zone and larger ones further north under the influence of West Wind Drift waters. Larger size classes of E. crystallorophias concentrated in nearshore areas. Krill was smaller in neritc and larger in oceanic waters. The overall krill length frequency distribution was similar to that reported from the South Shetland Island region for the same period. The recruitment index for E. crystallorophias and Thysanoessa macrura age group 1+ indicated a very successful year-class 1992/93 in the region (R(1) = 0.412 and R(1) = 0.609, respectively), while krill showed the opposite, a poor recruitment of the 1992/93 year class (R(1) = 0.076). Spawning was late during the 1994 season for E. crystallorophias and E. superba; no larvae were found in the area. These findings are discussed in the light of recently described correlations between winter sea-ice conditions and krill spawning and recruitment success, and lead to the conclusion that recruitment of the 1993/94 krill year-class will be poor.																	0944-1921						1996	44	1-2					115	139									WOS:A1996VV96000008

A post-processing method to remove interference noise from acoustic data collected from Antarctic krill fishing vessels	CCAMLR SCIENCE												The use of fishing-vessel-based acoustic data has been recognised as an important way to estimate the distribution and relative abundance of Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba), yet the quality and even the utility of the data may be seriously degraded by interference noise due to the lack of synchronisation of the acoustic instruments found on some of the vessels. A simple method to remove significant interference noise was introduced based on relevant virtual variable operators in the existing acoustic data post-processing software. The utility of the method was demonstrated by applying it to the acoustic data at 38, 70 and 120 kHz collected from a Chinese krill fishing vessel. Results show that the interference noise was effectively reduced while structure and echo strength of the krill swarms were retained. The method may provide opportunity to improve the utility of fishing-vessel-based acoustic data for a range of objectives.																	1023-4063						2016	23						17	30									WOS:000389894300002

POLAR BIOLOGY												Macaroni penguins have evolved to cope with the highly variable conditions of the Southern Ocean. However, changes in prey supply and patchiness potentially associated with changes in climate and krill fishing activity may be occurring too rapidly for the penguins to adapt. We use a stochastic dynamic programming model to examine how changes in both the mean and patchiness of krill supply may affect the foraging decisions, and therefore breeding success, of female macaroni penguins at South Georgia. We predict that rapid changes in the mean supply of prey will have more of an effect on the condition of the female and chick than changes in prey patchiness, and that changes in foraging behavior compensate for changes in prey up to a threshold point, beyond which breeding success is likely impacted. In particular., we predict that the location of the threshold is affected by whether or not the penguins are adapted to the prey environment in which they are foraging, with the female and chick receiving on average 20% less of their daily energetic requirement if the female is not foraging optimally.

Several authors have discussed factors in addition to diet that might contribute to variability in delta(15)N of consumers, but few studies have explored such factors in detail. For a better understanding of tissue-specific differences in delta(15)N, we examined postlarval euphausiids across a variety of seasons and regions in the Southern Ocean. The concentration and delta(15)N of individual amino acids were analysed to account for both the biochemical and physiological underpinnings of the observed bulk delta(15)N. Euphausiids showed consistent d(15)N differences of 1 to 2 parts per thousand between the digestive gland and abdominal segment, and between reproductively active males and females. These differences in bulk delta(15)N were accompanied by variations in relative proportions of amino acids (up to 5 mol %) and their delta(15)N (up to 11parts per thousand). Aspartic acid and glutamic acid had the strongest influence on bulk delta(15)N, due to their high abundance and variable delta(15)N values. Differences in relative proportions and/or delta(15)N of glycine and alanine were also important for bulk delta(15)N values. Isotopic variations in amino acids between gender and tissues were explained by dominant internal processes such as protein synthesis or degradation for energy supply, and by differences in amino acid pool sizes. Despite the offset in bulk delta(15)N between females and males, several lines of evidence suggested that their trophic levels were similar. Thus, specific amino acid composition and metabolism may confound trophic level interpretations of bulk delta(15)N values. Micronekton are normally analyzed whole in isotopic studies, and we suggest that their analyses should be restricted to comparable tissues such as muscles.

Krill as a central node for iron cycling in the Southern Ocean	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS												In order to establish the potential role of Antarctic krill ( Euphausia superba) in the recycling of bioactive elements, we have quantified the release of iron, phosphate, and ammonia by these organisms along the Antarctic Peninsula sector of the Southern Ocean. The experimental results suggested that the presence of krill has a significant impact on ambient iron concentrations, as large amounts of this trace element were released by the krill ( 22 - 689 nmol Fe g Dry Weight(-1) h(-1), equivalent to 0.2 to 4.3 nmol Fe L-1 d(-1)). Half of this iron release occurred within the first hour of the experiment, and differences in iron and phosphate release rates (3.1 to 14.0 mu mol PO43- g DW-1 h(-1)) seemed to reflect differences in food availability. These results identify krill as a major node in iron cycling in the Southern Ocean, potentially influencing iron residence time in the upper water column of this region.

The pelagic tunicate Salpa thompsoni can also be important during spring and summer through the formation of extensive and dense blooms(6-9). Although salps are not a major dietary item for Antarctic vertebrate predators(7,10), their blooms can affect adult krill reproduction and survival of krill larvae. Here we provide data from 1995 and 1996 that support hypothesized relationships between krill, salps and region-wide sea-ice conditions(11,12). We have assessed salp consumption as a proportion of net primary production, and found correlations between herbivore densities and integrated chlorophyll-a that indicate that there is a degree of competition between krill and salps. Our analysis of the relationship between annual sea-ice cover and a longer time series of air temperature measurements(12,13) indicates a decreased frequency of winters with extensive sea-ice development over the last five decades. Our data suggest that decreased krill availability may affect the levels of their vertebrate predators. Regional warming and reduced krill abundance therefore affect the marine food web and krill resource management.																	0028-0836					JUN 26	1997	387	6636					897	900		10.1038/43174							WOS:A1997XG41600050						
J	Bahlburg, D; Meyer, B; Berger, U				Bahlburg, Dominik; Meyer, Bettina; Berger, Uta			The impact of seasonal regulation of metabolism on the life history of Antarctic krill	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING												Antarctic krill up- and down-regulate their metabolism as a strategy to cope with the strong seasonal environmental fluctuations in the Southern Ocean. In this study, we investigate the impact of this light- and temperature dependent metabolic regulation on growth, reproduction and winter survival of krill. Therefore, we advance a bioenergetic growth model of krill by adding a data-derived scaling function of krill activity. With SERBIK (SEasonally Regulated BIoenergetic Krill growth model), we conduct a numerical experiment which tests the impact of such scaling on krill life history under two different winter food conditions: In the first scenario, we simulate life history of krill when winter food availability is low; in the second scenario, winter food availability is increased within realistic ranges. The results demonstrate that the scaling of metabolism is especially important during low food winters. Reducing metabolism during winter permits individuals to grow to larger body length, reproduce successfully and release a greater number of eggs. It further significantly reduces within-year size fluctuations caused by starvation during months with low food availability. Finally, SERBIK can be used in future spatial modelling studies which include movement of krill along latitudinal gradients and thus spatiotemporal gradients in light- and temperature.

The method utilized UHPLC-MS in electrospray ionization mode (ESI). Samples were prepared by alkaline hydrolysis; sequential vortex extraction with ethyl acetate, methanol and acetonitrile; followed by a QuEChERS (Quick, Easy, Cheap, Effective, Rugged and Safe) clean-up method. The system suitability tests including theoretical plate number, resolution, repeatability, tailing factor proved the system's resolution and reproducibility that can meet the requirements of sample analysis. The developed method resulted in satisfactory recoveries that varied from 75.4%-110.6% and relative standard deviations (RSDs) that ranged from 3.1%-10.5%. The ranges of the limits of detection (LODs) and the limits of quantitation (LOQs) were 2-30 ng kg(-1) and 10-100 ng kg(-1), respectively. 14 hormones including cortisone, aldosterone, testosterone propionate, estriol, megestrol acetate, cortisone acetate, dexamethasone, testosterone, hydroxyprogesterone, nandrolone, prednisolone, cortisol, progesterone and estradiol were found in Antarctic krill. Other 3 hormones (Diethylstilbestrol, norethisterone and androsterone) were not detected. The levels of exogenous steroid hormones were much greater than those of endogenous steroid hormones, and the levels of exogenous glucocorticoids were much greater than those of exogenous sex hormones. The changes of hormones in different sex and maturity stages were also explored. Endogenous hormones might regulate the reproductive and development of Antarctic krill. The detected exogenous hormones suggests the potential for hormonal contamination in Antarctic waters that can affect organisms even affect human beings by food chain.																	1932-6203					MAR 11	2019	14	3							e0213398	10.1371/journal.pone.0213398							WOS:000461030300035	30856222

Over a 14 d period 38 swarms were sampled in a small area southwest of Elephant Island, South Shetland Islands. Analysis indicated that the composition of the swarms in terms of the sex ratio and maturity stage was very variable. Swarms ranged from equal mixtures of male and female krill to nearly all one sex; furthermore krill of similar maturity frequently occurred together. The mean length of each maturity stage also varied between swarms; in some swarms the size of each maturity stage was bigger than average while in others each stage was smaller than average. The range of krill sizes in a swarm was often restricted, indicative of some type of size sorting. However size sorting alone could not account for the observed variation in sex ratio and maturity stage and it is likely that in addition, differential growth and active behavioural responses contribute to the observed variation.																	0171-8630					JUN	1992	82	2					163	174		10.3354/meps082163							WOS:A1992HZ19000006

The general levels of Pb-210 are within the range of previously published data but, as in the case of Po-210, there are differences which can be associated with variations in the diet of the organism. The levels of Pb-210 in the krill Euphausia superba show seasonal changes which can be interpreted in terms of changing diet.

Future ocean and sea-ice changes affecting the distribution of such species will impact the structure and functioning of whole ecosystems. Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) is a key species in Southern Ocean food webs, but there is little understanding of the factors influencing its success throughout much of the ocean. The capacity of a habitat to maintain growth will be crucial and here we use an empirical relationship of growth rate to assess seasonal spatial variability. Over much of the ocean, potential for growth is limited, with three restricted oceanic regions where seasonal conditions permit high growth rates, and only a few areas around the Scotia Sea and Antarctic Peninsula suitable for growth of the largest krill (> 60 mm). Our study demonstrates that projections of impacts of future change need to account for spatial and seasonal variability of key ecological processes within ocean ecosystems.

The biochemical estimation of age in Euphausiids: Laboratory calibration and field comparisons	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY												Euphausiids play a key role in many marine ecosystems as a link between primary producers and top predators. Understanding their demographic (i.e. age) structure is an essential tool to assess growth and recruitment as well as to determine how changes in environmental conditions might alter their condition and distribution. Age determination of crustaceans cannot be accomplished using traditional approaches, and here we evaluate the potential for biochemical products of tissue metabolism (termed lipofuscins) to determine the demographic structure of euphausiids in field collections. Lipofuscin was extracted from krill neural tissues (eye and eye-stalk), quantified using fluorescent intensity and normalized to tissue protein content to allow comparisons across animal sizes. Multiple fluorescent components from krill were observed, with the major product having a maximum fluorescence at excitation of 355 nm and emission of 510 nm. Needed age calibration of lipofuscin accumulation in Euphausia pacifica was accomplished using known-age individuals hatched and reared in the laboratory for over one year. Lipofuscin content extracted from neural tissues of laboratory-reared animals was highly correlated with the chronological age of animals (r=0.87). Calibrated with laboratory lipofuscin accumulation rates, field-collected sub-adult and adult E. pacifica in the Northeast Pacific were estimated to be older than 100 days and younger than 1 year. Comparative data for the Antarctic krill, E. superba showed much higher lipofuscin values suggesting a much longer lifespan than the more temperate species, E. pacifica. These regional comparisons suggest that biochemical indices allow a practical approach to estimate population age structure of diverse populations, and combined with other measurements can provide estimates of vital rates (i.e. longevity, mortality, growth) for krill populations in dynamic environments.

Intra-annual variability in the density of Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) at south Georgia, 2002-2005: Within-year variation provides a new framework for interpreting previous 'annual' estimates of krill density	CCAMLR SCIENCE												Upward-looking acoustic Doppler current profilers (300 kHz) and echo sounders (125 kHz) were deployed on moorings on- and off-shelf to the northwest of South Georgia between 14 October 2002 and 29 December 2005 to measure density of Antarctic krill and environmental parameters continuously. A distinct seasonal pattern in krill density, recurring consistently over all three years, was detected. Krill densities in winter were predominantly low (mean = 18.7 g m(-2), SD = 24.3), but had risen substantially by summer in each year (mean = 89.5 g m(-2), SD = 64.2). A sinusoidal regression model (period = 52 weeks) with time as the independent variable explained 64% of the observed week-to-week variation. Estimates of krill density from moored instruments were not statistically different (P > 0.05) from estimates derived from standard ship-based krill surveys in adjacent time periods, suggesting that the point estimates from moored instruments were representative of krill density in a wider spatial context (ship surveys cover c. 100 x 100 km). Data from moored instruments were used to explore whether high-frequency temporal variation (i.e. within-year) could have led to the perceived between-year variation in krill density arising from previous summer surveys in the South Georgia western core box region between 1990 and 2005. Comparison of these 'snap-shot' ship survey estimates with the observed pattern of within-year variability showed that some of the apparent 'year-to-year' variation could simply be attributed to sampling on different dates of the year (e.g. November cf. February). However, there were some survey estimates that were significantly different (P < 0.01) from the regression-predicted within-year variation. Years that stand out for markedly low krill density (i.e. densities below the range expected due to intra-annual variation) were 1993/94, 1998/99 and 1999/2000. Moored instruments provide valuable data that could be important for ecosystem-based management at South Georgia because, for example, they will enable predator-prey functional responses to be explored there for the first time at appropriate temporal scales, and will enable hypotheses relating variation in krill abundance to physical oceanographic variability to be tested.

Salp biomass ranged between 0 and 556 mgC.m-3 and was greatest at a station in the Bransfield Strait in late December 1990. Scalp biomass was lower than that of E. superba. Two species of salps; Salpa thompsoni and Ihlea racovitzai were found, and the former was dominant numerically. Spatial distribution and generation composition of these two species was different. Spatial distributions of salps and E. superba did not overlap particularly so the January-February period. While E. superba was found mainly in the coastal area which showed high-chlorophyll a values, salps exhibited high biomass in the oceanic area with low chlorophyll a concentrations. Predation by salps on small krill and the competitive removal of food by them, are discussed as potential reasons for the relatively low abundance of E. superba at the stations where salps were present in great numbers.

The oceanography of the South Georgia region is principally that of the Southern Ocean rather than the South Atlantic. A combination of factors, including advection, local bathymetry and high local productivity, leads to relatively large concentrations of krill (Euphausia superba) in the region and this is a food source for large populations of penguins and seals that breed at South Georgia. 2. A history of over-exploitation of the marine resources of the region has led to the development of ecosystem approaches to management. The current system for managing krill harvests includes precautionary features that account for interannual variability in krill populations and the food requirements of natural predators. However, in future, it may be possible to use information from the natural krill predators to set reasonable levels of krill exploitation.

Decreases in krill abundance could result in a major ecological regime shift, but there is limited information on how climate change may affect krill. Increasing anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions are causing ocean acidification, as absorption of atmospheric CO2 in seawater alters ocean chemistry. Ocean acidification increases mortality and negatively affects physiological functioning in some marine invertebrates, and is predicted to occur most rapidly at high latitudes. Here we show that, in the laboratory, adult krill are able to survive, grow, store fat, mature, and maintain respiration rates when exposed to near-future ocean acidification (1000-2000 mu atm pCO(2)) for one year. Despite differences in seawater pCO(2) incubation conditions, adult krill are able to actively maintain the acid-base balance of their body fluids in near-future pCO(2), which enhances their resilience to ocean acidification.

Gaussian component analysis of krill samples, pooled by sectors, showed three cohorts of Euphausia superba in the western sector and one in the eastern sector. Across the sampling area, Thysanoessa mactura and E. superba occurred at separate stations. Analysis of cohorts in T macrura separated two size groups in both the western and the eastern sectors. The use of a Differentiation Index (D.I.) [Farber-Lorda, J., 1990. Somatic length relationships and ontogenetic morphometric differentiation of Euphausia superba and Thysanoessa macrura of the southwest Indian Ocean during summer (February 1981). Deep-Sea Res. 37,1135-1143.], based on somatic lengths, allows studying certain morphological differences within the populations sampled. Morphologically different and bigger males 11 (D.I. from 2.8 to 3.5) were present only in the southern transect while smaller males I (D.I. from 3.5 to 5.0) were present over the entire area. Biochemical composition of both species showed significant differences among stations for protein, lipids, and carbohydrates. A significant difference in lipid content was found between males I, and males II. For T macrura, percentage of lipid content in mature animals was much higher than that in E. superba. The D.I. size distribution showed that when populations of E. superba were highly differentiated (corresponding to mature animals) in morphology, lipid content was high, and they were located near a gyre. Differences in morphometry can influence distribution of the species, because different developing stages have different swimming capacities. It is shown that, together with hydrography and trophic conditions, lipid content and morphometry of krill populations, are different but complementary aspects that help to understand krill ecology and distribution.

Feeding frequencies, feeding rates and meal sizes varied between years, and feeding rates were correlated with data of the Antarctic krill Euphausia superba abundance in the Elephant Island region. The overall breeding success of breeding pairs was low, ranging from 0 to 34%. Snow storms and wind conditions depressed breeding success even in years of good food availability, and snow storms were the most important determinant of the breeding success over the seven seasons. Snow storms during the breeding season occurred during periods of prevailing easterly winds. In addition, the distribution of wind directions was found to strongly influence the krill availability to storm-petrels.

It analysed faecal samples from five consecutive years (1997-2001) and length distribution of krill taken by trawl nets in the vicinity of Livingston Island. Antarctic krill, Euphausia superba, was the most frequent prey item, followed by several myctophid species (Gymnoscopelus nicholsi, Electrona antarctica and Electrona carlsbergi), squid and penguin remains. From 1998 to 2001, a modal progression in krill size was evident, suggesting that A. gazella was depending on a strong krill cohort, at least over the study period. Analysis of size distribution and size selectivity of krill preyed upon by fur seals suggests a preference for larger krill (>34 mm), despite the broader size range of preys items available.

J	Tynan, CT				Tynan, CT			Ecological importance of the Southern Boundary of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current	NATURE												The Southern Ocean surrounds the Antarctic continent and supports one of the most productive marine ecosystems. Migratory and endemic species of whales, seals and birds benefit from the high biomass of their principal prey, krill (Euphausia superba) and cephalopods, in this area. Most species of baleen whales and male sperm whales in the Southern Hemisphere migrate between low-latitude breeding grounds in winter and highly productive Antarctic feeding grounds in summer. Here I show the importance of the southernmost reaches of the strongest ocean current, the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC), to a complex and predictable food web of the Southern Ocean, The circumpolar distributions of blue, fin and humpback whales from spring to midsummer trace the non-uniform high-latitude penetration of shoaled, nutrient-rich Upper Circumpolar Deep Water, which is carried eastward by the ACC, The poleward extent of this water mass delineates the Southern Boundary(1) of the ACC and corresponds not only to the circumpolar distributions of baleen whales, but also to distributions of krill and to regions of high, seasonally averaged, phytoplankton biomass, Sperm whales, which feed on cephalopods(2), also congregate in highest densities near the Southern Boundary. The association of primary production, Krill, and whales with the Southern Boundary, suggests that it provides predictably productive foraging for many species, and is of critical importance to the function of the Southern Ocean ecosystem.																	0028-0836					APR 16	1998	392	6677					708	710		10.1038/33675							WOS:000073129000056

The potential significance of the presence of UV-sensitivity in Antarctic fish is that it might increase foraging efficiency by enhancing the contrast of important prey. Krill (Euphausia superba), for example, are probably silhouetted against UV-background space light during the Antarctic summer.																	0722-4060					AUG	2001	24	8					628	632		10.1007/s003000100278							WOS:000170351700011

Krill fed on phytoplankton during the day (as deduced from gut fluorescence measurements), whereas they switched to carnivory during the night (as deduced from gut contents). The vertical migration and the feeding behaviour of krill agree with different observations in the literature and gives an additional explanation to the observed inverse relationship between krill and non-krill zoo-plankton. The fact that krill is able to prey on mesozooplankton suggests that euphausiids can exert a top-down effect which structures the plankton community of Antarctic waters.

J	Conti, SG; Demer, DA				Conti, SG; Demer, DA			Improved parameterization of the SDWBA for estimating krill target strength	ICES JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE												Recently, a Stochastic Distorted Wave Born Approximation (SDWBA) model was proposed to improve target strength (TS) estimates for Antarctic krill, Euphausia superba. The krill shape is modelled by a collection of cylinders, and total sound scatter is estimated by semi-coherent summation of scatter from each element. The SDWBA model was evaluated with a generic krill shape comprising 14 cylinders and a phase variability of root 2/2 radians, and predictions were validated with empirical TS and total TS data at 120 kHz, and over a broad bandwidth, respectively. For general application, parameterization of the SDWBA model is improved to account explicitly for dependence among four of the model parameters: standard length of krill, number of cylinders used to describe its shape, amplitude of inter-element phase variability, and acoustic frequency. The model improvements are demonstrated, and the uncertainty in orientation distribution of krill beneath survey vessels and its ramifications on krill biomass estimates are highlighted.

Fatty acid trophic markers elucidate resource partitioning within the demersal fish community of South Georgia and Shag Rocks (Southern Ocean)	MARINE BIOLOGY												Fatty acid analysis was used to study the trophic ecology of 10 demersal fish species in the South Georgia region. Principal component analysis grouped the species into three general clusters, revealing resource partitioning between species. Two groups were characterised by large proportions of either monounsaturated or polyunsaturated fatty acids, separating species according to their predominant feeding habitat. The third group showed fatty acid signatures overlapping with either or both of the previous two groups, suggesting a more opportunistic feeding behaviour for these species. Intraspecific comparisons furthermore revealed dietary variability with size, year and geographical location in several species. Mackerel icefish (Champsocephalus gunnari) in particular showed inter-annual differences in muscle lipid concentrations closely linked to prey availability with low lipid contents found in years of low krill (Euphausia superba) abundance. Despite the intraspecific differences the majority of species could be easily distinguished from each other, which indicates the utility of this method in the dietary analysis of higher predators.

J	Demer, DA; Conti, SG				Demer, DA; Conti, SG			Reconciling theoretical versus empirical target strengths of krill: effects of phase variability on the distorted-wave Born approximation	ICES JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE												A model was recently proposed to predict the target strengths (TS) of Antarctic krill, Euphausia superba, versus incidence angle (theta) (Deep Sea Res. 1145(7) (1998) 1273). Based on the distorted-wave Born approximation (DWBA), the model depends on the coherent summation of scattering from elements of a discretized-bent cylinder. It was empirically validated at 120 kHz near-broadside incidence (theta approximate to 90degrees), but large discrepancies were observed at other angles away from the main lobe. As the side-lobe measurements were both higher than the model predictions and above the noise floor, the authors noted that the differences were not entirely due to noise. In this study, the accuracy of the DWBA model is further explored. Results indicate that phase variability in the scatter from elements of a discretized-bent cylinder (krill model) causes a dramatic flattening in the side-lobe regions of TS(theta), while negligibly affecting the main scattering lobe. These results are consistent with the krill TS measurements reported by McGehee et al. Thus, by accounting for phase variability in the solution of the DWBA model, a more accurate and thus practical tool is developed for predicting krill TS.

We considered DVM in relation to krill body length, based on Japanese krill fishery data (1990-2012), and examined DVM in relation to food availability and predator (Antarctic fur seal) avoidance. We report that diel changes in median trawling depth (a proxy for krill vertical distribution) showed significant interannual variation; the overall trend was such that during both daytime and nighttime, the larger the average size of krill, the deeper their median depth. Consistent with the literature, this size-dependent DVM relates to food availability and size-dependent diet; that is, with increasing body length, krill tend to rely less on phytoplankton (which are available in surface layers) as a winter food source. Concerning predator avoidance, and based on analyses using an optimal foraging dive model for fur seals, DVM showed close agreement with size-dependent predation risk; that is, larger krill remained deeper, thereby reducing mortality from fur seals. Therefore, DVM of overwintering krill appears to reflect a compromise between adequate feeding conditions and minimizing predation risk. There was, however, an exception that krill occurred at a shallow depth in winter 2006 when phytoplankton abundance was particularly low and krill density was very high. This supports the hypothesis that physiological demands (i.e. hunger) may become a more important factor affecting DVM than predator avoidance under conditions of insufficient food availability.																	0171-8630	1616-1599				NOV 12	2020	654						53	66		10.3354/meps13508							WOS:000621236300004

Antarctic krill Euphausia superba was a major component of the food, accounting for 75% of all prey items. Emperor penguins appear to feed on krill during shallow dives under the fast sea ice. Fish, mainly nototheniids, accounted for less than 20% by number of all prey. An evaluation of the main prey types in terms of mass indicated, however, that fish represented up to 75% approximately of prey mass. Feeding experiments were performed on captive penguins and showed that squid beaks can accumulate for up to 3 weeks within the stomach without any clear signs of erosion. The lack of cephalopod soft parts in the samples makes it likely that all squid beaks were derived from animals captured some time previously. Squid seems to be a very minor dietary component of emperor penguins at the Drescher Inlet.

Swarm signals occurring on the echorecords were mainly found in the upper 100 m of the watercolumn, in size varying vertically from 1 to 70 m, and horizontally from less than 5 to over 3,000 m. Catches with a RMT 1 + 8 indicated that the observed swarm signals were most probably caused by krill, Euphausia superba. From late November to early January the swarms migrated northwards away from the ice-edge and towards greater depths, while simultaneously growing in size. The average number of swarms observed per 10 nautical miles along the transects remained fairly constant throughout the cruise, but the average swarm-size and total aggregation size increased during the period studied. The echo-data give evidence of the spring-summer migration of major parts of the krill stock from under the ice-cover towards open waters.																	0722-4060					SEP	1992	12	2					261	268									WOS:A1992JN35500014

In this study, we experimentally determined the quantity and spectral quality of CDOM generated by bacterioplankton using two different substrates ( with and without photoproducts) and by Antarctic krill Euphausia superba and evaluated their potential contributions to CDOM dynamics in the peninsular region of the Southern Ocean. CDOM was generated by bacteria in all experiments, and the presence of photoproducts influenced both the quantity and the spectral quality of the resultant CDOM. We confirmed a direct link between bacterial production and CDOM generation, which yielded in situ CDOM duplication times from 31 to 33 d. Antarctic krill as a direct source of CDOM was also confirmed experimentally. We estimated that CDOM generation by krill would lead to CDOM duplication times from 0.48 to 0.80 d within krill swarms. Our findings highlight the potential significance of bacteria and Antarctic krill swarms in the generation of CDOM and underscore the dynamic nature of CDOM in this area.

Dynamic foraging of a top predator in a seasonal polar marine environment	OECOLOGIA												They seasonal movement of animals at broad spatial scales provides insight into life-history, ecology and conservation. By combining high-resolution satellite-tagged data with hierarchical Bayesian movement models, we can associate spatial patterns of movement with marine animal behavior. We used a multi-state mixture model to describe humpback whale traveling and area-restricted search states as they forage along the West Antarctic Peninsula. We estimated the change in the geography, composition and characteristics of these behavioral states through time. We show that whales later in the austral fall spent more time in movements associated with foraging, traveled at lower speeds between foraging areas, and shifted their distribution northward and inshore. Seasonal changes in movement are likely due to a combination of sea ice advance and regional shifts in the primary prey source. Our study is a step towards dynamic movement models in the marine environment at broad scales.

J	Hinke, JT; Trivelpiece, WZ				Hinke, Jefferson T.; Trivelpiece, Wayne Z.			Daily activity and minimum food requirements during winter for gentoo penguins (Pygoscelis papua) in the South Shetland Islands, Antarctica	POLAR BIOLOGY												Estimates of daily activity and consequent demand for food during winter are scarce for many polar seabirds, yet essential for assessing constraints on foraging effort, demand for food, and potential competition with local fisheries. We affixed archival temperature tags to gentoo penguins (Pygoscelis papua) from two colonies in the South Shetland Islands to measure the frequency, timing, and duration of foraging trips and to estimate minimum food requirements during winter. Foraging trip frequencies ranged from 0.85 to 1.0 trips day(-1) and were positively correlated with day length. Early winter foraging trips more closely matched day length than late winter foraging trips. The data suggest that individuals maximize foraging time during the early winter period, likely to recover body mass following the breeding season and molt. The more attenuated response of foraging trip durations to increasing day length in late winter may be related to differences in local resource availability or individual behaviors prior to the upcoming breeding season. Minimum food requirements also exhibited a seasonal cycle with a mid-winter minimum. On average, minimum food requirements were estimated at 0.70 +/- 0.12 kg day(-1). Extrapolated to the regional population of gentoo penguins, winter food requirements by gentoo penguins were equivalent to roughly 33% of annual krill catches by commercial fisheries in the South Shetland Island region over the past decade. Current expansion of the gentoo population and the krill fishery in the southern Scotia Sea warrants continued monitoring of gentoo penguins during winter.				, Jefferson/AAG-1702-2021	, Jefferson/0000-0002-3600-1414												0722-4060					OCT	2011	34	10					1579	1590		10.1007/s00300-011-1018-x							WOS:000297202300015

Euphausiid distribution along the Western Antarctic Peninsula - Part B: Distribution of euphausiid aggregations and biomass, and associations with environmental features	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY												The distribution of euphausiids (Euphausia spp.) in the continental shelf region in and around Marguerite Bay, west of the Antarctic Peninsula, was studied in relation to aspects of the physical and biological environment. Acoustic, video, net, and environmental data were collected during surveys in the austral falls and winters of 2001 and 2002.. Application of the analysis methods described in Lawson et al. [2008. Euphausiid distribution along the Western Antarctic Peninsula-Part A: Development of robust multi-frequency acoustic techniques to identify euphausiid aggregations and quantify euphausiid size, abundance, and biomass. Deep-Sea Research II, this issue] to acoustic survey data demonstrated strong seasonal, inter-annual, and spatial variability in krill distribution. The distribution of krill aggregations was characterized by many small aggregations closely spaced relative to one another, punctuated by much fewer aggregations of very large size that accounted for the majority of overall biomass in the region. The greatest number of aggregations was found at depths less than 100 in, but biomass was usually greatest at deeper depths. Similar biomass levels were estimated for both the fall surveys and the winter of 2002 survey, while biomass during the winter of 2001 was an order of magnitude smaller. During fall, biomass estimates vertically integrated over the sampled portion of the water column were negatively associated with chlorophyll a concentrations, and some suggestion was observed of highest biomass in regions of lowest current magnitude and horizontal current gradient. Generalized additive models indicated that highest krill biomass was consistently associated with regions close to land where the temperature maximum below 200m depth was cooler than what was available over the shelf as a whole. Krill were thus not associated with regions where intrusions of warm and nutrient-rich circumpolar deep water onto the shelf were present, despite such intrusions being thought to be an important driver of primary productivity.

J	Kruger, L				Kruger, Lucas			Spatio-temporal trends of the Krill fisheries in the Western Antarctic Peninsula and Southern Scotia Arc	FISHERIES MANAGEMENT AND ECOLOGY												Krill fisheries in Antarctica have concentrated their effort on the Western Antarctic Peninsula and Scotia Arc (WAP) in the last decades, following a steady increase in annual catch. Short-term shifts in habitat exploration may have occurred and may be the cause for the increasing catch. Habitat use and effort in krill fisheries in the WAP during summer between 2012/2013 and 2016/2017, inclusive, were tested to determine how habitat use and effort reflected in the catch. Increasing trends in fishing tow duration and depth of fishing in deeper and colder waters were found. No association of the catch with the habitat explored was found, but catch was higher in years when the variability of explored habitat was lower. The relevance of these findings for fisheries management and conservation of Antarctic marine ecosystems is discussed.

J	Alonzo, SH; Switzer, PV; Mangel, M				Alonzo, SH; Switzer, PV; Mangel, M			Ecological games in space and time: The distribution and abundance of Antarctic krill and penguins	ECOLOGY												The distribution and abundance of organisms are affected by behaviors, such as habitat selection, foraging, and reproduction. These behaviors are driven by interactions within and between species, environmental conditions, and the biology of the species involved. Although extensive theoretical work has explored predator-prey dynamics, these models have not considered the impact of behavioral plasticity and life-history trade-offs on predicted patterns. We apply a modeling method that allows the consideration of a spatial, dynamic ecological game between predators and prey using a life-history perspective. As an illustrative example, we model the habitat selection of Antarctic krill- and penguins during the time when penguins are land-based for reproduction. Although environmental conditions and the life-history constraints of each species have both direct and indirect effects on both species, the penguin's foraging rule (whether food-maximizing or time-minimizing) has the greatest effect on the qualitative distribution pattern of both species. Size-dependent-diel vertical migration of krill also strongly affects penguin foraging patterns. This model generates suggestions for future research and qualitative predictions that can be tested in the field. The application of this method to a specific problem also demonstrates its ability to increase our understanding of important ecological interactions in general.																	0012-9658	1939-9170				JUN	2003	84	6					1598	1607		10.1890/0012-9658(2003)084[1598:EGISAT]2.0.CO;2							WOS:000184451900028

The uptake rate constant (characterised by the seawater volume stripped of contaminant sorbed to algae) of 200 +/- 032 mL g(-1) wet weight h(-1), average absorption efficiency of 86 +/- 13% and very low elimination rate constant of 5 x 10(-6) +/- 0.0031 h(-1) demonstrate the importance of feeding for p,p'-DDE bioaccumulation in Antarctic krill. Faecal egestion of unabsorbed p,p'-DDE of 8.1 +/- 2.7% indicates that this pathway contributes considerably to p,p'-DDE sinking fluxes. A median internal effective concentration (IEC50) of 15 mmol/kg lipid weight for complete immobility indicates baseline toxicity and that Antarctic krill exhibit comparable toxicological sensitivity as temperate species under similar 10 d exposure conditions. These findings support the critical body residue approach and provide insight to the role of Antarctic krill in the biogeochemical cycling of p,p'-DDE in the Southern Ocean. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Owens (1995) Deep-Sea Research II, 42, 907-932]. A total of 285 targets were identified and described from the chart record of the echo sounder. Mean volume backscattering strength data were collected using an echo integration system. These data are used to describe the spatial and temporal variability of kriII (Euphausia superba) distribution and biomass in the marginal ice-edge zone. Krill biomass density varied from a mean of 32 g m(-2) during the first survey phase to 20 g m(-2) on the second survey phase. The number of small swarms detected during the second phase was greater than during the first phase. On this first survey a large swarm (2.8 km in extent) had a potential biomass of 3.7 x 10(4) tonnes. Some calculations are presented to show the potential impact of krill on the flux of carbon in the area of the survey.																	0967-0645						1995	42	4-5					1159	1175		10.1016/0967-0645(95)00059-Y							WOS:A1995RV69700015

Zooplankton collections were dominated by Thysanoessa macrura in September-October 1995 (high pack-ice cover) and by both Euphausia superba and Salpa thompsoni in April-May 1996 (intermediate pack-ice cover) and November-December 1996 (open water).

Here, we analyse the number of samples required to estimate the characteristics of a local population as precisely as if there were no differences between krill swarms in terms of their biological composition. Krill were intensively sampled over different spatial and temporal scales around South Georgia in 1981 and 1982, and in the Bransfield Strait in 1985. These varied from replicate hauls at a single station over 24 h and repeat sampling in restricted areas over periods of 6 to 14 d to regional surveys around South Georgia and in the Bransfield Strait. Various biological characteristics were measured such as length, maturity, moult stage and feeding state. Depending upon the biological characteristic examined and the area covered by the sampling programme, the number of samples needed to obtain the same degree of precision as would be found in the absence of heterogeneity varied from 3 to > 80 samples. This has important implications for the design of net-sampling programme for monitoring krill populations.																	0025-3162						1990	107	3					409	415		10.1007/BF01313422							WOS:A1990EP46800005

Better late than never? Interannual and seasonal variability in breeding chronology of gentoo penguins at Stranger Point, Antarctica	POLAR RESEARCH												Rapid climate change recorded in the western Antarctic Peninsula confronts species with less predictable conditions in the marine and terrestrial environments. We analysed the breeding chronology and nesting site selection of gentoo penguins (Pygoscelis papua) at King George Island (Isla 25 de Mayo), Antarctica, during four seasons in which differences in snow presence and persistence on the ground were observed. We recorded an overall delay as well as seasonal asynchrony at the beginning of reproduction for those years with higher snow deposition. A redistribution of breeding groups was also observed. Nevertheless, the population breeding success and chicks' weight at fledging remained relatively constant, despite the delay in breeding chronology, the increased duration of foraging trips during the guard stage and the decreased weight of stomach contents during the creche stage. We suggest that the plasticity of their trophic biology, along with the flexibility of their breeding phenology and relocation of breeding groups, may be complementary reasons why gentoo penguin populations in the region have remained stable in spite of the changing conditions currently registered.

In the austral autumn we observed an extremely high density (5.1 whales per km(2)) of humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) feeding on a super-aggregation of Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) in Wilhelmina Bay. The krill biomass was approximately 2 million tons, distributed over an area of 100 km(2) at densities of up to 2000 individuals m(-3); reports of such 'super-aggregations' of krill have been absent in the scientific literature for >20 years. Retentive circulation patterns in the Bay entrained phytoplankton and meso-zooplankton that were grazed by the krill. Tagged whales rested during daylight hours and fed intensively throughout the night as krill migrated toward the surface. We infer that the previously unstudied WAP embayments are important foraging areas for whales during autumn and, furthermore, that meso-scale variation in the distribution of whales and their prey are important features of this system. Recent decreases in the abundance of Antarctic krill around the WAP have been linked to reductions in sea ice, mediated by rapid climate change in this area. At the same time, baleen whale populations in the Southern Ocean, which feed primarily on krill, are recovering from past exploitation. Consideration of these features and the effects of climate change on krill dynamics are critical to managing both krill harvests and the recovery of baleen whales in the Southern Ocean.

We review the available data on the region's physical characteristics (currents and ice concentrations) and their spatial variations, as well as components of the neritic food web, including lower and middle levels (phytoplankton, zooplankton, krill, fishes), the upper trophic levels (seals, penguins, pelagic birds, whales) and benthic fauna. A hypothetical food web is presented. Biotic interactions, such as the role of Euphausia crystallorophias and Pleuragramma antarcticum as grazers of lower levels and food for higher trophic levels, are suggested as being critical. The neritic food web contrasts dramatically with others in the Antarctic that appear to be structured around the keystone species Euphausia superba. Similarly, we suggest that benthic-pelagic coupling is stronger in the Ross Sea than in most other Antarctic regions. We also highlight many of the unknowns within the food web, and discuss the impacts of a changing Ross Sea habitat on the ecosystem.																	0962-8436	1471-2970				JAN 29	2007	362	1477					95	111		10.1098/rstb.2006.1956							WOS:000243528200006	17405209

Improving the Accuracy of Krill Target Strength Using a Shape Catalog	FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE												Antarctic krill are subject to precautionary catch limits, based on biomass estimates, to ensure human activities do not adversely impact their important ecological role. Accurate target strength models of individual krill underpin biomass estimates. These models are scaled using measured and estimated distributions of length and orientation. However, while the length distribution of a krill swarm is accessible from net samples, there is currently limited consensus on the method for estimating krill orientation distribution. This leads to a limiting factor in biomass calculations. In this work, we consider geometric shape as a variable in target strength calculations and describe a practical method for generating a catalog of krill shapes. A catalog of shapes produces a more variable target strength response than an equivalent population of a scaled generic shape. Furthermore, using a shape catalog has the greatest impact on backscattering cross-section (linearized target strength) where the dominant scattering mechanism is mie scattering, irrespective of orientation distribution weighting. We suggest that shape distributions should be used in addition to length and orientation distributions to improve the accuracy of krill biomass estimates.

The delta-C-13 values of these animals ranged from -33.2 to -23.9 parts per thousand, and a significant negative logarithmic relationship was observed between these values and biomass C/N. This implies that the relative proportion of carbon-rich C-13-depleted lipid in these animals significantly influenced the delta-C-13 of their bulk biomass. No such relationship with C/N is evident with respect to biomass delta-N-15 where values ranged from -1.2 to +7.3 parts per thousand. This spread of values reflects a wide diversity of food sources and trophic positions among the species analyzed. Isotopic abundances within krill Euphausia superba varied with individual length, apparently reflecting dietary changes during growth.

It supports a large number of upper trophic-level predators, and is also a major fishery resource. Understanding changes in krill abundance has long been a priority for research and conservation in the Southern Ocean. In this study, we performed stable isotope analyses on ancient Adelie penguin tissues and inferred relative krill abundance during the Holocene epoch from paleodiets of Adelie penguin (Pygoscelis adeliae), using inverse of delta N-15 (ratio of N-15/N-14) value as a proxy. We find that variations in krill abundance during the Holocene are in accord with episodes of regional climate changes, showing greater krill abundance in cold periods. Moreover, the low delta N-15 values found in modern Adelie penguins indicate relatively high krill availability, which supports the hypothesis of krill surplus in modern ages due to recent hunt for krill-eating seals and whales by humans.

Advances in Technologies for Highly Active Omega-3 Fatty Acids from Krill Oil: Clinical Applications	MARINE DRUGS												Euphausia superba, commonly known as krill, is a small marine crustacean from the Antarctic Ocean that plays an important role in the marine ecosystem, serving as feed for most fish. It is a known source of highly bioavailable omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid). In preclinical studies, krill oil showed metabolic, anti-inflammatory, neuroprotective and chemo preventive effects, while in clinical trials it showed significant metabolic, vascular and ergogenic actions. Solvent extraction is the most conventional method to obtain krill oil. However, different solvents must be used to extract all lipids from krill because of the diversity of the polarities of the lipid compounds in the biomass. This review aims to provide an overview of the chemical composition, bioavailability and bioaccessibility of krill oil, as well as the mechanisms of action, classic and non-conventional extraction techniques, health benefits and current applications of this marine crustacean.

Metachronal swimming in Antarctic krill: gait kinematics and system design	MARINE BIOLOGY												Metachronal swimming, in which adjacent appendages stroke in sequence, is widespread among crustaceans inhabiting the transitional flow realm in which both viscosity and inertia effects are important. However, the design and operation of this propulsion system in response to various hydrodynamic, energetic, and behavioral needs have not been well investigated. We examine free-swimming Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) as a model species and identify three distinct behavioral swimming gaits. The pleopod kinematics of these gaits, hovering, fast-forward swimming, and upside-down swimming, are quantified via image analysis of high-speed video. Pleopod stroke amplitude and frequency were found to vary significantly among these swimming modes. In order to increase swimming speed, krill were found first to increase stroke amplitude and secondarily to increase beat frequency. The kinematics of these distinct swimming modes provide insight as we consider multi-appendage metachronal swimming from a design standpoint. The ratio of the distance between adjacent appendage bases and appendage length is identified as a key parameter in metachrony, the value of which is constrained to a narrow range for a wide variety of species.

Decision-making for ecosystem-based management: evaluating options for a krill fishery with an ecosystem dynamics model	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS												Decision-makers charged with implementing ecosystem-based management (EBM) rely on scientists to predict the consequences of decisions relating to multiple, potentially conflicting, objectives. Such predictions are inherently uncertain, and this can be a barrier to decision-making. The Convention on the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources requires managers of Southern Ocean fisheries to sustain the productivity of target stocks, the health and resilience of the ecosystem, and the performance of the fisheries themselves. The managers of the Antarctic krill fishery in the Scotia Sea and southern Drake Passage have requested advice on candidate management measures consisting of a regional catch limit and options for subdividing this among smaller areas. We developed a spatially resolved model that simulates krill-predator-fishery interactions and reproduces a plausible representation of past dynamics. We worked with experts and stakeholders to identify (1) key uncertainties affecting our ability to predict ecosystem state; (2) illustrative reference points that represent the management objectives; and (3) a clear and simple way of conveying our results to decision-makers. We developed four scenarios that bracket the key uncertainties and evaluated candidate management measures in each of these scenarios using multiple stochastic simulations. The model emphasizes uncertainty and simulates multiple ecosystem components relating to diverse objectives. We summarize the potentially complex results as estimates of the risk that each illustrative objective will not be achieved (i.e., of the state being outside the range specified by the reference point). This approach allows direct comparisons between objectives. It also demonstrates that a candid appraisal of uncertainty, in the form of risk estimates, can be an aid, rather than a barrier, to understanding and using ecosystem model predictions. Management measures that reduce coastal fishing, relative to oceanic fishing, apparently reduce risks to both the fishery and the ecosystem. However, alternative reference points could alter the perceived risks, so further stakeholder involvement is needed to identify risk metrics that appropriately represent their objectives.				, Jefferson/AAG-1702-2021; Simeon, Hill L/B-2307-2008	, Jefferson/0000-0002-3600-1414; 												1051-0761	1939-5582				JUN	2013	23	4					710	725		10.1890/12-1371.1							WOS:000320105100003	23865224

Flexible foraging strategies of gentoo penguins Pygoscelis papua over 5 years in the South Shetland Islands, Antarctica	MARINE BIOLOGY												Gentoo penguins Pygoscelis papua show considerable plasticity in their diet, diving, and foraging behaviors among colonies; we expected that they might exhibit similar variability over time, at a single site, since flexible foraging habits would provide a buffer against changes in prey availability. We examined interannual changes in the foraging strategies and diet of gentoo penguins in the South Shetland Islands, Antarctica, over 5 years with variable prey abundance. Antarctic krill Euphausia superba was the primary diet item, and fish the secondary, though the importance of these items varied among years. Diving behavior also varied over time: different dive depth distributions were observed among years. Nonetheless, chick-rearing success remained relatively constant, indicating that gentoo penguins were able to maintain chick provisioning by altering their foraging strategy among years. Variable abundance of krill in the region did not have observable impacts on the diet, foraging behaviors or chick-rearing success of gentoo penguins. We suggest that foraging plasticity may be one reason that gentoo penguin populations have remained stable in the region, while their congeners (P. antarctica and P. adeliae) with less flexible foraging strategies have declined.																	0025-3162	1432-1793				NOV	2009	156	12					2527	2537		10.1007/s00227-009-1277-z							WOS:000270721000010						
J	Cornejo-Donoso, J; Antezana, T				Cornejo-Donoso, Jorge; Antezana, Tarsicio			Preliminary trophic model of the Antarctic Peninsula Ecosystem (Sub-area CCAMLR 48.1)	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING												Species, biomasses, production rates, distribution and other aspects of the community structure have been studied in the Antarctic Ecosystem; however there are no integrated models that explain mass transfer at the spatial mesoscale. Even though the Antarctic Ecosystem as a whole has been identified as a functional unit, subsystems could be identified and characterized, among which, the Antarctic Peninsula stands out for its particular geography, oceanography and trophic web. The aim of this work is to construct a mass balanced model describing the main trophic interactions of this community. The model is built using the software Ecopath with Ecosim 5.0, which yields a representation of the trophic web and estimations of global ecosystem properties. Phytoplankton, zooplankton and krill accounted for most of the mass flow. Flows to the trophic level II (TL II; detritivores and herbivores) were attributed to zooplanktonic and benthic organisms mainly Flows to the TL III were explained by fish, birds (flying birds and penguins), Balaenoptera acutorostrata and baleen whales. Flows to the TL IV were dominated by some fish, birds (flyingbirds and penguins) and mammals. Finally, in TL VI, the flows were dominated by Orcinus orca. O. orca was the top predator in the ecosystem with a TL of 4.88, followed by Physeter catodon (4.63) and Hydrurga leptonyx (4.62). Krill was found at the intermediate TL (2.33). Resulting ecosystem indexes (e.g. total transfer efficiency, connectance index, etc.) were consistent and characteristic of ecosystems of high temporal and spatial variability. The model gives a comprehensive description of the food web dominated by phytoplankton-krill-top predators chain, and complemented with alternative food pathways (e.g. through Electrona antarctica), which together gives an enhanced complexity to the system. Despite the limitations of the model in data gaps, particularly for winter season, grouping of functional groups, steady state assumptions, etc., it improves the description of the trophic structure and ecosystem functioning of the Antarctic Peninsula and highlights gaps in knowledge.

The Oceanography and Ecology of the Ross Sea	ANNUAL REVIEW OF MARINE SCIENCE, VOL 6	Annual Review of Marine Science											The continental shelf of the Ross Sea exhibits substantial variations in physical forcing, ice cover, and biological processes on a variety of time and space scales. Its circulation is characterized by advective inputs from the east and exchanges with off-shelf regions via the troughs along the northern portions. Phytoplankton biomass is greater there than anywhere else in the Antarctic, although nitrate is rarely reduced to levels below 10 mu mol L-1. Overall growth is regulated by irradiance (via ice at the surface and by the depths of the mixed layers) and iron concentrations. Apex predators reach exceptional abundances, and the world's largest colonies of Adelie and emperor penguins are found there. Krill are represented by two species (Euphausia superba near the shelf break and Euphausia crystallorophias throughout the continental shelf region). Equally important and poorly known is the Antarctic silverfish (Pleuragramma antarcticum), which is also consumed by most upper-trophic-level predators. Future changes in the Ross Sea environment will have profound and unpredictable effects on the food web.

Stenotrophomonas maltophilia FF11, isolated from frozen Antarctic krill, grows at a wide range of temperatures and secretes more proteases at low temperatures. According to zymogram analysis, two kinds of proteases were produced from this strain. A major protease was produced largely at 15 A degrees C, but not at 37 A degrees C. The temperature-dependent secreted protease was purified to homogeneity. Its molecular mass was determined at 37.4 kDa and its amino acid sequence was also obtained. This protease is a member of the subtilase group according to the NCBI blast analysis. The enzyme was highly stable at high salt concentration (4 M). Interestingly, its activity increased about 1.6-fold under high salt condition. The enzyme remains active and stable in different organic solvents (50 %, v/v) such as dimethylsulfoxide, dimethyl formamide, dioxane and acetone. These properties may provide potential applications in quality control for sea foods, in protein degradation at high salt concentration, in biocatalysis and biotransformation within non-aqueous media, such as detergent and transesterification.																	1367-5435	1476-5535				JUN	2016	43	6					829	840		10.1007/s10295-016-1749-3							WOS:000376930500010	27001262					
J	Gorska, N; Chu, D				Gorska, N; Chu, D			Some aspects of sound extinction by zooplankton	JOURNAL OF THE ACOUSTICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA												To address the importance of sound extinction (or the shadowing effect) in the presence of a densely aggregated zooplankton layer, acoustic scattering by weakly scattering fluid objects is studied theoretically. An analytical expression for the extinction cross section is obtained based on the forward scattering theorem and the analytical formula for the forward scattering amplitude is derived from the Modal Based-Deformed Cylinder Model (MB-DCM). The validity of the MB-DCM solution for the forward scattering amplitude and its sensitivity to geometrical and physical parameters is studied. Comparison with the PC-DV;BA (Phase-Compensated-Distorted Wave Born Approximation) shows a reasonable agreement between the two models. The extinction cross section is shown to be proportional to (ka)(2) and the induced attenuation is predicted for various species of zooplankton over a wide frequency range. It is shown that, under certain realistic conditions, such as the presence of a swarm of aggregated krill, sound extinction by zooplankton could influence the acoustic measurements significantly, as much as an 85% reduction in acoustic intensity for Euphausia superba with n = 5000 ind./m(3) over a range of 50 m.

The timing of sea ice formation and exposure to photosynthetically active radiation along the Western Antarctic Peninsula	POLAR BIOLOGY												Understanding the flow of solar energy into ecosystems is fundamental to understanding ecosystem productivity and dynamics. To gain a better understanding of this fundamental process in the Antarctic winter sea ice, we produced a model that estimates the time-integrated exposure of seasonal Antarctic sea ice to PAR through the use of remotely sensed sea ice concentrations, sea ice movement and spatially distributed PAR calculations that account for cloud cover and have applied this model over the past three decades. The resulting spatially distributed estimates of sea ice exposure to PAR by mid-winter are evaluated in context of changes in the timing of sea ice formation that have been documented along the Western Antarctic Peninsula (WAP) region and its potential effects on the variation (seasonal and inter-annual) in the accumulation of sea ice algae in this region. The analysis shows the ice pack is likely to have large inter-annual variations (10-100 fold) in productivity throughout the autumn to winter transition in the sea ice along the WAP. Moreover, the pack ice is likely to have spatial structure in regards to biological processes that cannot be determined from analysis of sea ice concentration information alone. The resulting inter-annual variations in winter processes are likely to affect the dynamics of Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba).																	0722-4060					MAY	2011	34	5					683	692		10.1007/s00300-010-0924-7							WOS:000289481400007						
J	Nevitt, G				Nevitt, G			Olfactory foraging in Antarctic seabirds: a species-specific attraction to krill odors	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												Antarctic procellariiform seabirds are known for their well-developed sense of smell, yet few behavioral experiments have addressed how these birds use olfactory cues to forage at sea. I describe results from controlled, shipboard experiments performed in Antarctic waters near Elephant Island. Birds were presented with plain or krill-scented (Euphausia superba) vegetable oil slicks, and their behavioral responses were compared. Krill-scented vegetable oil slicks were highly attractive to some but not all procellariiform species foraging in this area (p < 0.001, G-test). Cape petrels Daption capense and southern giant petrels Macronectes giganteus appeared at krill-scented slicks within 1 min, whereas black-browed albatrosses Diomedea melanophris appeared within 3 min. Cape petrels D, capense showed the strongest attraction: these birds were observed as much as 5 times as frequently at krill-scented slicks as compared to unscented control slicks (p < 0.001, G-test), while storm-petrels (Oceanites oceanicus and Fregetta tropica) and Antarctic Fulmars Fulmarus glacialoides responded in equal numbers to krill-scented and unscented slicks. When considered with respect to previously published findings, these results suggest a greater complexity in the significance of odors to the foraging ecology of different tube-nosed species than has commonly been assumed.																	0171-8630	1616-1599					1999	177						235	241		10.3354/meps177235							WOS:000079215300021

The minke whales' dominant feeding ground coincided with a distinctive hydrographic front in the vicinity of the ice-edge at the mouth of Vincennes Bay. Krill (Euphausia superba) were the dominant food species comprising 100% and 94% by weight of stomach contents in the ice-edge and offshore zones, respectively. In the offshore zone, minke whales tend to feed on E. superba rather than Thysanoessa macrura, which is found more frequently than the former in net samples. Total food consumption by minke whales per day was estimated to be 1170 t (22.1 kg/km2) and 596 t (2.0 kg/km2) in the ice-edge and offshore zones, respectively. Feeding activity peaked in the early morning in the ice-edge zone, whereas it occurred irregularly throughout the day in the offshore zone. Two size modes of krill (25-28 mm in body length (1 year-old) and 41-48 mm (3-4 year-old)) dominated the diet. Although the former was numerically more abundant, the latter dominated the diet by weight, suggesting that larger krill are more important food for minke whales. Observed spatial pattern of krill populations in the study region suggests that movement of the subsurface cold water mass tended to carry krill offshore from the ice-edge.																	0722-4060	1432-2056				DEC	1991	11	7					479	487									WOS:A1991GU47800008						
J	Ritz, DA				Ritz, DA			Is social aggregation in aquatic crustaceans a strategy to conserve energy?	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES					2nd International Symposium on Krill	AUG 23-27, 1999	UNIV CALIF SANTA CRUZ, SANTA CRUZ, CALIFORNIA		UNIV CALIF SANTA CRUZ			Antarctic krill, Euphausia superba, is preeminently a gregarious animal. It lives for almost the whole of its existence from the late furcilia stage in aggregations. Despite this, laboratory study of schooling and swarming behaviour has been seriously neglected and critical emergent properties of group dynamics may have been overlooked. Using different-sized groups of gregarious mysids, I show that weight-specific oxygen uptake is reduced by about seven times when they form cohesive aggregations compared with when they are in uncohesive small groups. If this is true for E. superba. it casts doubt on all previous measurements of metabolic rate and suggests that estimates of the metabolic cost of swimming and perhaps feeding are much too high. The reason that groups conserve energy compared with isolates or small groups is hypothesised to be at least partly due to hydrodynamic processes, which serve to minimise sinking rates. Dye plumes revealed updrafts generated by mysid swarms, which could be exploited by individuals to reduce their sinking rate. These circulation patterns might also increase the efficiency of particle capture by aggregations. I propose that aggregation in aquatic crustaceans is a strategy to optimise energy expenditure and maximise food capture. Measuring behavioural and physiological rate processes in isolated animals will produce only artifacts.																	0706-652X						2000	57			3			59	67		10.1139/cjfas-57-S3-59							WOS:000166531600008

In all years, the 2 prion species fed on crustaceans, with a small proportion of mesopelagic fish and squid. The hyperiid amphipod Themisto gaudichaudii was consistently the dominant prey item, accounting for 76 and 70 % by number, and 57 and 57 % by reconstituted mass of the diet of R belcheri and P. desolata, respectively. Prions, however, were segregated by feeding on different euphausiids, P. belcheri on Thysanoessa sp. (18 % by number and 16% by mass) and P. desolata on Euphausia vallentini (9% by number and 15% by mass). R desolata also caught more small prey such as copepods (9 vs <1% by number) and cypris larvae of Lepas australis (8 vs 3% by number) than P. belcheri, which can be related to the beak filtering apparatus present only in the former species, Biogeography of the prey and their state of digestion indicate that prions foraged in a wide variety of marine habitats, including the kelp belt, kelp rafts, and coastal, neritic and oceanic waters. Noticeable is the occurrence of E. superba in a significant number of food samples (15 and 10% for P. belcheri and P. desolata, respectively), suggesting feeding in distant foraging grounds in southern Antarctic waters, >1000 km from the breeding colonies, during the chick-rearing period. The stable-carbon and -nitrogen isotopic compositions of chick feathers were identical in both species, indicating no important trophic segregation during the breeding period, when adult birds are central-place foragers. The ratios were, however, different in adult feathers, suggesting moulting in Antarctic waters for P. belcheri and in subtropical waters for P. desolata, i.e. in distinct foraging areas when birds are not constrained to return to the colonies.

This can have a flow-on effect, providing increased food availability for higher trophic level species. Using data from a 5-day combined visual and acoustic survey, we examined the hypothesis that higher Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) density provides a lucrative resource for humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) at a remote Antarctic feeding area, the Balleny Islands (67(o)S, 164 degrees E). We assessed whale presence at the feeding area in relation to prey (krill), productivity and environmental variables using density surface modeling. We found stark differences between krill swarms near the islands and those in adjacent open water. Swarms were twice as dense and three times more numerous near the Balleny Islands compared to an open water pelagic environment, suggesting that the islands offered a profitable feeding opportunity. At the feeding area, whales were found in deeper and more productive waters with medium krill densities. These relationships, along with the high krill availability around the islands, may be the result of the Island Mass Effect.

Zooplankton excretion metabolites stimulate Southern Ocean phytoplankton growth	POLAR BIOLOGY												Warming over Antarctica is leading to changes in the zooplankton communities inhabiting the Southern Ocean. It has been observed that zooplankton not only regulates phytoplankton through grazing, but also through the recycling of nutrients that are essential for phytoplankton growth. In this way, the effects of warming on zooplankton populations will change the amount or proportion at which recycled nutrients are restored. To estimate how the recycled nutrients released by zooplankton populations, dominated by krill (Euphausia superba), amphipods or copepods, affect the phytoplankton uptake and communities, we performed four incubation experiments: two close to the Antarctic Peninsula and two at the Southern Atlantic Ocean. Our results showed a stimulating effect of the addition of metabolites on ammonia removal rates and on the net growth of phytoplankton communities, with different responses amongst the different phytoplankton groups. According to our results, phytoplankton net growth and community composition may be altered if this relevant source of nutrients is lost due to projected changes in the abundance or distribution of these zooplankton populations.

It is hypothesized that this species, already adapted to endure metabolic extremes, will be one of the first Antarctic consumers to show measurable physiological change in response to fluctuating prey availability in a changing climate; and as such, a powerful sentinel candidate for the Antarctic sea-ice ecosystem. Here, we targeted the sentinel parameters of humpback whale adiposity and diet, using novel, as well as established, chemical and biochemical markers, and assembled a time trend spanning 8 years. We show the synchronous, inter-annual oscillation of two measures of humpback whale adiposity with Southern Ocean environmental variables and climate indices. Furthermore, bulk stable isotope signatures provide clear indication of dietary compensation strategies, or a lower trophic level isotopic change, following years indicated as leaner years for the whales. The observed synchronicity of humpback whale adiposity and dietary markers, with climate patterns in the Southern Ocean, lends strength to the role of humpback whales as powerful Antarctic sea-ice ecosystem sentinels. The work carries significant potential to reform current ecosystem surveillance in the Antarctic region.

J	Nicol, S				Nicol, S			Understanding krill growth and aging: the contribution of experimental studies	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES					2nd International Symposium on Krill	AUG 23-27, 1999	UNIV CALIF SANTA CRUZ, SANTA CRUZ, CA		UNIV CALIF SANTA CRUZ			Krill have been viewed as: difficult animals to examine experimentally. Consequently, most information on growth and age of these pelagic crustaceans has come from demographic studies on preserved specimens. Only one species of krill, Euphausia superba, has been intensively studied in the laboratory, but the experimental findings on growth and age from these studies have fundamentally altered our perceptions of the population biology of this species. Most other species of krill remain in the preexperimental phase of understanding; thus, there remain considerable uncertainties regarding their growth and longevity. Unfortunately, these uncertainties are often ignored in ecological studies. In this paper, I have examined the role that experimental studies have played in increasing knowledge of the population biology of krill, particularly in the fields of growth and aging. I have indicated where discrepancies exist between field-based and experimental approaches and I outline some approaches for exploring these discrepancies and suggest some potentially fruitful areas for future research.																	0706-652X	1205-7533					2000	57			3			168	177		10.1139/cjfas-57-S3-168							WOS:000166531600015

We examined the spatial distributions of pelagic seabirds and tur seals near South Georgia, and asked to what extent the distributions of these predators were influenced by the spatial distribution of their principal prey, Antarctic krill Euphausia superba Dana. One novel aspect of our analysis is an explicit consideration of the separation in space between swarms of krill and aggregations of predators that feed upon krill. 2. Our data were collected in February 1986, during a systematic shipboard survey of the waters surrounding Bird Island, South Georgia. Predator abundance was estimated visually using strip transects, and krill abundance was simultaneously estimated using a hull-mounted echosounder. 3. We approached the difficult analytical problems associated with spatial distributions of organisms by using spatial autocorrelation and cross-correlation analysis, regression models with spatial terms, and randomization tests. The randomization tests involved repeated simulations of predator distributions, and subsequent estimation of spatial association between predators and prey. 4. Pelagic birds and seals were distributed in a strikingly non-random fashion at sea near South Georgia; their distributional patterns were strongly influenced by the distribution of krill swarms. 5. Differences between predators in their spatial distribution and in their response to krill swarms suggest interspecific differences in foraging strategies.																	0021-8790						1993	62	3					551	564		10.2307/5204							WOS:A1993LK28200015

ENZYME REGULATION OF SELECTED CRUSTACEANS WITH REGARD TO LIFE-STYLE AND THE CLIMATIC ZONE	JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE PHYSIOLOGY B-BIOCHEMICAL SYSTEMIC AND ENVIRONMENTAL PHYSIOLOGY												Citrate synthase is a regulatory enzyme of the energy metabolism pathway controlling the citric acid cycle. It was studied in order to determine modes of enzyme regulation with regard to the life-style of the investigated species. Citrate synthase from crustaceans with different life-styles were compared: the pelagic euphausiids Euphausia superba from the Antarctic and Meganyctiphanes norvegica from the Scandinavian Kattegat and the Mediterranean were compared to the benthic isopods Serolis polita from the Antarctic and Idotea baltica from the Baltic. Citrate synthase was partly purified chromatographically and the influence of adenosine 5'-triphosphate on enzyme activity was examined. Mechanisms of inhibition and inhibitor constants were determined. Two different mechanisms of enzyme regulation by ATP were found. Citrate synthase from isopods was only competitively inhibited. while citrate synthase from euphausiids showed not only competitive inhibition but also activation by low concentrations of ATP. This activation is equivalent to the reversed mechanism of uncompetitive inhibition. The ecophysiological relevances of the coupling of these mechanisms are discussed. The degree of competitive inhibition was different in the two groups of investigated crustaceans. Inhibitor constants were similar within the euphausiids but not in isopods. which showed higher or lower inhibition depending on the climatic zone: the colder the ambient temperature the lower the ATP inhibition. A possible mechanism of temperature adaptation through effects of varying inhibition constants is concluded.																	0174-1578	1432-136X				APR	1995	165	1					56	61		10.1007/BF00264686							WOS:A1995QX90900007						
J	SUN, S; DELAMARE, W; NICOL, S				SUN, S; DELAMARE, W; NICOL, S			THE COMPOUND EYE AS AN INDICATOR OF AGE AND SHRINKAGE IN ANTARCTIC KRILL	ANTARCTIC SCIENCE												Laboratory studies have shown that Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) shrink if maintained in conditions of low food availability. Recent studies have also demonstrated that E. superba individuals may be shrinking in the field during winter. If krill shrink during the winter, conclusions reached by length-frequency analysis may be unreliable because smaller animals may not necessarily be younger animals. In this study, the correlation between the body-length and the crystalline cone number of the compound eye was examined. Samples collected in the late summer show an apparent linear relationship between crystalline cone number and body-length. From a laboratory population, it appears that when krill shrink the crystalline cone number remains relatively unchanged. If crystalline cone number is little affected by shrinking, then the crystalline cone number may be a more reliable indicator of age than body-length alone. The ratio of crystalline cone number to body-length offers a method for detecting the effect of shrinking in natural populations of krill. On the basis of the crystalline cone number count, it appears from a field collection in early spring that E. superba do shrink during winter.																	0954-1020					DEC	1995	7	4					387	392		10.1017/S0954102095000538							WOS:A1995TH80600007

Here, we demonstrate the organ-specific distribution and physiological relevance of both forms using a polyclonal antibody preparation which allows them to be distinguished immunologically. While NAGase B was localized in the integument and displayed a pattern of activity related to the moult cycle, the activity of NAGase C was independent of the moult cycle and was predominantly found in the gastrointestinal tract. Accordingly, NAGase B played a significant role in chitin degradation during the krill's moult, whereas NAGase C participated in the digestion of chitin-containing dietary components. Chromatographic elution profiles of isolated organs confirmed the immunological results by displaying characteristic organ-specific patterns in NAGase activity. The molecular characteristics of the moulting form, NAGase B, may further indicate a vesicular transport of moulting enzymes from the epidermis into the ecdysial space. Based on our results we develop a hypothesis explaining the concurrent processes of simultaneous chitin degradation and chitin synthesis occurring during moult.

We determined the composition of euphausiid species in diet samples collected from Adelie (Pygoscelis adeliae), chinstrap (Pygoscelis antarcticus) and gentoo (Pygoscelis papua) penguins on King George Island (South Shetlands Islands) during a breeding season. For all three penguin species, euphausiids (mainlyE. superba) represented almost the entirety of researched stomach samples (i.e. 99.9% in the case of Adelie and chinstrap penguins), while gentoo penguins also proved to feed on fish (99.4% krill; 0.5% fish). Analysed material differed in the size of eatenE. superbaspecimens, with the smallest crustaceans consumed by Adelie penguins. Furthermore, we found differences in the ratio of consumed krill and krill size. Such disparities may be a result of sex-based differences and slight differences in feeding areas between the birds. Additionally, we noted some fragments of plastic debris in the investigated penguin diet samples.

J	Leane, E; Nicol, S				Leane, Elizabeth; Nicol, Steve			Charismatic Krill? Size and Conservation in the Ocean	ANTHROZOOS												The open ocean is an alien place for human beings and for most of history it has been studied using very indirect means. A great deal of what we know about animals that live on land, from ants to elephants, is based on centuries of direct natural history observations of animals alive and in situ. There is no such body of observation of marine animals. Most of what we know about animals in the ocean comes from studying dead animals, collected in nets towed through ocean depths that we can rarely observe. Marine biological knowledge is flavored by the material we have to work with and this, in turn, is affected by the terminology that early scientists used in an attempt to describe the strange world that their nets revealed. Despite the recent development of more sophisticated ways of investigating the ocean, many marine scientists continue to adopt nineteenth-century terminology and approaches (such as the use of the term zooplankton and the use of plankton nets), and this colors interpretation of the results of oceanographic studies. Using Antarctic krill Euphausia superba as an example, we suggest that the perception amongst both scientists and the general public of krill's small size, passivity, and lack of individuality has led to their being treated less like animals themselves than as background habitat for other animals. Because krill have such a central role in the Antarctic ecosystem and are the subject of a large fishery, these assumptions may have serious consequences for krill themselves and the conservation of the Antarctic region as a whole.

J	Zhou, M; Huntley, ME				Zhou, M; Huntley, ME			The principle of biological attraction, demonstrated by the bio-continuum theory of zooplankton patch dynamics	JOURNAL OF MARINE RESEARCH												A theory of zooplankton and micronekton patch dynamics is developed that expressly includes animal behavior. This represents a departure from traditional models of patch dynamics, which generally treat animals as Lagrangian particles whose distributions are determined solely by processes of advection and diffusion. The ''bio-continuum'' theory is based on principles of statistical mechanics, and describes animal aggregations in terms of mean motion, random motion, random kinetic energy, distribution and abundance. The forces on an animal aggregation act both upon the aggregation as a whole (external forces) or between individuals (internal forces). We demonstrate here that the internal forces which serve to maintain autocoherence are, in essence, a force of biological attraction that can be quantified in Newtons. A coefficient of biological attraction is defined, and its magnitude evaluated in aggregations of Antarctic euphausiids (Euphausia superba). We hypothesize that the coefficient of biological attraction may be constant for all organisms in the sea. A method for measuring all key variables with acoustic Doppler technology is presented, with specific attention to application of the Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP). We conclude that bio-continuum theory, coupled with acoustic Doppler observations, provides a practical approach for studying animal aggregation dynamics in the sea.																	0022-2402	1543-9542				SEP	1996	54	5					1017	1037		10.1357/0022240963213619							WOS:A1996VP29700008

The majority of the 57 species did not vertically migrate and lived deeper during the winter than during the spring or fall. However, despite the short day length, several of the most common mesopelagic fish and crustaceans did migrate. Fish moved into shallower depths at night but apparently most did not continue into the near-freezing upper mixed layer, leaving that zone to the migratory crustaceans. In the upper 1000 m, the dominant species were, in order of decreasing biomass, Euphausia superba, the cnidarian Atolla wyvillei, the ctenophore Beroe sp., and the mesopelagic fish Electrona antarctica, Bathylagus antarcticus and Gymnoscopelus braueri. Thysanoessa macrura and Salpa thompsoni were biomass subdominants. The majority of the dominant species showed little seasonal differences in biomass. However, the biomass of gelatinous species varied considerably with A. wyvillei and Beroe sp. being most abundant and S. thompsoni least abundant during the winter. Incidence of food in the stomachs in several important species was low, suggesting a low impact on their zooplankton prey. Specimens of S. thompsoni had high quantities of food in their guts but this species was uncommon so its net impact would also have been low. Euphausia superba and the three common mesopelagic fish had significantly lower stomach fullness ratings during the winter than during the fall, suggesting an overall decrease in feeding activity of dominant species during the winter.																	0722-4060					JUN	1991	11	3					157	167									WOS:A1991FU68700002

Serendipitous observations from animal-borne video loggers reveal synchronous diving and equivalent simultaneous prey capture rates in chinstrap penguins	MARINE BIOLOGY												Seabirds often engage in coordinated, cooperative foraging to improve detection and capture of prey. An extreme example of such coordinated behavior is synchronicity, whereby the movements of individuals are aligned temporally and spatially. Synchronous diving among penguins has been reported, but simultaneous observations of predation by synchronously diving individuals have not. We instrumented chinstrap penguins (Pygoscelis antarcticus) during their incubation period in December 2019 from Cape Shirreff, Livingston Island, Antarctica (60.79 degrees W, 62.46 degrees S) with video and depth recorders to monitor predator foraging behavior and prey consumption rates. Serendipitously, two instrumented individuals, accompanied by a third, banded individual, engaged in synchronous foraging activities on Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) for 9.25 h. This group formed ashore, transited together to their foraging area, remained in close visual contact after dives, synchronously timed diving behavior, and foraged at similar depths. Prey capture rates were positively correlated across dives and total consumption estimates were equivalent for the two instrumented birds during the video observation period. Video loggers confirmed that synchronous diving and foraging behavior are among the behavioral repertoire of chinstrap penguins and demonstrated equivalent prey capture rates by synchronously foraging predators. The results further suggest that group formation while ashore and group cohesion during a foraging trip may facilitate shared foraging success among group members.

Risk maps for Antarctic krill under projected Southern Ocean acidification	NATURE CLIMATE CHANGE												Marine ecosystems of the Southern Ocean are particularly vulnerable to ocean acidification(1). Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba; hereafter krill) is the key pelagic species of the region and its largest fishery resource(2). There is therefore concern about the combined effects of climate change, ocean acidification and an expanding fishery on krill and ultimately, their dependent predators-whales, seals and penguins(3,4). However, little is known about the sensitivity of krill to ocean acidification. Juvenile and adult krill are already exposed to variable seawater carbonate chemistry because they occupy a range of habitats and migrate both vertically and horizontally on a daily and seasonal basis(5). Moreover, krill eggs sink from the surface to hatch at 700-1,000m (ref. 6), where the carbon dioxide partial pressure (p(CO2)) in sea water is already greater than it is in the atmosphere(7). Krill eggs sink passively and so cannot avoid these conditions. Here we describe the sensitivity of krill egg hatch rates to increased CO2, and present a circumpolar risk map of krill hatching success under projected p(CO2) levels. We find that important krill habitats of the Weddell Sea and the Haakon VII Sea to the east are likely to become high-risk areas for krill recruitment within a century. Furthermore, unless CO2 emissions are mitigated, the Southern Ocean krill population could collapse by 2300 with dire consequences for the entire ecosystem.

Diet of Ad,lie penguins (Pygoscelis adeliae) at Stranger Point (25 de Mayo/King George Island, Antarctica) over a 13-year period (2003-2015)	POLAR BIOLOGY												Knowledge of the feeding ecology of a species at local level is fundamental to determine the relationship between the fluctuations in local marine resources and population dynamics of predators. In this study, we examined the diet of Ad,lie penguins (Pygoscelis adeliae) during the crSche stage at the Stranger Point colony, South Shetland Islands, Antarctica, over a 13-year period (2002/2003-2014/2015). Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) was the dominant prey for Ad,lie penguins during the crSche period (contribution: 100% of occurrence and > 99.7% by mass). The fish component in the diet represented a small proportion of the total prey (contribution: from 4 to 24% of occurrence but < 0.15% by mass). A marked inter-annual variability in the mass of stomach contents, the krill size consumed and the proportion of juvenile krill was observed. Moreover, a possible recruitment event of krill was recorded. A negative relationship between the size of krill in the diet and breeding success was found, suggesting that population dynamics of krill also reflected changes in the local availability of this crustacean. This work is the first long-term study of dietary parameters of Ad,lie penguins for the Stranger Point colony.

Specimens were collected in the Scotia-Weddell Sea region in the vicinity of 60-degrees-S, 40-degrees-W in the upper 1000 m of the water column. Respiration (y, mul O2mg-1 wet mass h-1) declined with depth of occurrence (x, m) according to the equation y = 0.125 x-0.172 +/- 0.052 (p < 0.05) despite the isothermal character of the water column, suggesting that lower metabolic rates are a temperature-independent adaptation to life in the deep sea. Three species of Crustacea showed a lowered metabolism during the winter season: the krill Euphausia superba and the 2 hyperiid amphipods Cyllopus lucasii and Vibilia stebbingi. Critical oxygen partial pressure (Pc) varied between 29 and 52 mm Hg, well below the lowest PO2 found in the water column. It is suggested that the long nights of the Antarctic winter decrease the effectiveness of visual predation in the epipelagic zone, allowing lowered metabolic rates to be a viable overwintering strategy for some species.																	0171-8630					OCT	1994	113	3					207	219		10.3354/meps113207							WOS:A1994PR37100001

The characteristics of krill swarms in relation to aggregating Antarctic blue whales	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS												We model the presence of rare Antarctic blue whales (Balaenoptera musculus intermedia) in relation to the swarm characteristics of their main prey species, Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba). A combination of visual observations and recent advances in passive acoustic technology were used to locate Antarctic blue whales, whilst simultaneously using active underwater acoustics to characterise the distribution, size, depth, composition and density of krill swarms. Krill swarm characteristics and blue whale presence were examined at a range of spatiotemporal scales to investigate sub meso-scale (i.e., <100 km) foraging behaviour. Results suggest that at all scales, Antarctic blue whales are more likely to be detected within the vicinity of krill swarms with a higher density of krill, those found shallower in the water column, and those of greater vertical height. These findings support hypotheses that as lunge-feeders of extreme size, Antarctic blue whales target shallow, dense krill swarms to maximise their energy intake. As both Antarctic krill and blue whales play a key role in the Southern Ocean ecosystem, the nature of their predator-prey dynamics is an important consideration, not only for the recovery of this endangered species in a changing environment, but for the future management of Antarctic krill fisheries.

Circumpolar patterns in Antarctic krill larval recruitment: an environmentally driven model	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												Larval recruitment in Antarctic krill is known to be episodic and regional. We consider the importance of a range of recruitment factors using an environmentally driven model of larval development from spawning to post-larvae. Our model examines the timing of spawning, interaction with bathymetry, susceptibility to cold temperatures, temperature-driven development and the seasonal cycle of sea ice to identify those factors with the greatest impact. The model predicts that the seasonal location of sea ice is the main limiting factor for successful larval recruitment. Spawning in January leads to the greatest area of viable larval recruitment habitat. Dense sea ice cover, which we assume that adult krill do not spawn under, prevents spawning in large areas early in the breeding season (December). Nevertheless, later spawning in February, when sea ice is at a minimum, means there is often insufficient time for the larvae to reach a viable developmental stage before the sea ice advances. Meanwhile, although spawning is possible in more northerly areas throughout the breeding season, these are generally remote from winter sea ice, which is assumed to be necessary for larvae to overwinter. Interaction with bathymetry before hatching further limits suitable habitat. Over a 12 yr period, the model predicted larval recruitment from January spawning in all years in the Cooperation, Ross and Weddell Seas, with episodic larval recruitment in the Bransfield Strait in 9 of the 12 years. Additional understanding of the overwintering requirements of larvae, together with regional studies at higher spatial resolution, particularly in shelf regions, will better constrain the uncertainties in the model.

Estimated densities of krill at SG were most often lower than at EI, although this may simply have been a function of differences in the survey and data-analysis techniques used at each site. More interestingly, the magnitudes of density and between-year gradients of density at each site were mirrored by those at the other location; for example 1991 and 1994 were years of very low krill density at both SG and EI. There was no apparent lag in changes in density between sites, and ranked between-year gradients in density at both locations were closely correlated. These pronounced similarities suggest that densities of krill at both locations are linked directly, and may be impacted by the same gross physical and biological factors (e.g. recruitment, dispersal and environmental variability) acting over the same temporal and spatial scales. The observed concordance also implies that the pelagic ecosystems at these widely separated sites (similar or equal to 1500 km distant at opposite sides of the Scotia Sea) are not operating in isolation. Fluctuations in krill density were investigated with reference to cyclical variations in sea ice extent, and in air and sea-surface temperature. The resulting model suggests that the 1999/2000 austral summer will be one of low krill density.

The observation was conducted in the Indian Ocean sector of the Southern Ocean in January 2014. The transmit signal was a 10-ms linear frequency-modulated signal with a frequency sweep of 20-200 kHz. A large aggregation of Antarctic krill was observed at a sampling station over the continental shelf. The volume-backscattering strengths in the frequency range of 85-187 kHz were determined from the observed echoes. In addition, the signal-to-noise ratio at each frequency was estimated and the measured volume-backscattering strengths were evaluated before inversion for accurate inferences. In this inversion, Antarctic krill were modeled as prolate spheroids and the target strengths were predicted by the distorted-wave Born approximation. The acoustically inferred mean length was in good agreement with the mode length determined by a net sampling performed immediately after the echo sampling. Also, the acoustically inferred length-frequency distribution was in reasonable agreement with the determined one from the net samples. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. and NIPR. All rights reserved.

Foraging behaviour in two Antarctic fur seal colonies with differing population recoveries	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												We compared Antarctic fur seals Arctocephalus gazella breeding at 2 contrasting sites on South Georgia: one high density colony at Bird Island and one lower density colony at Cooper Bay. The population at Cooper Bay was considerably smaller than that at Bird Island despite ample suitable breeding area being available. At Cooper Bay, female seals were longer but weighed less than those breeding at Bird Island and, whilst both maintained the same rate of female pup growth, male pups grew faster at Cooper Bay. Although Bird Island seals dived deeper, they dived less often than Cooper Bay seals so that both populations spent comparable amounts of time in the bottom phase of dives actively foraging. Longer distance oceanic foraging trips that were observed at Bird Island were almost entirely absent from Cooper Bay. Both populations fed on Antarctic krill, but there was an absence of myctophid prey in the diet of seals at Cooper Bay. Evidence suggests that the favoured myctophid prey of fur seals at South Georgia, Protomyctophum choriodon, are absent from the colder waters around the south-east of the island. We propose that, if these energy-rich prey are unavailable in this region then seals at Cooper Bay may find it hard to offset the increased costs of foraging trips with longer duration and distance. This potentially reduced niche width means that the Cooper Bay population may be less buffered against environmental variability. Although food resources appeared to be sufficient during the period of our study, the south-eastern region of South Georgia has increased variability in food resources that, coupled with a smaller area in which to forage, might explain the reduced population size compared to the north-eastern end of the island.

Variability of Salpa thompsoni population structure in the Drake Passage in summer season 2010	POLISH POLAR RESEARCH												Dynamic climate changes have become noticeable in recent decades, especially in the vulnerable region of the West Antarctic. The relatively simple food web of this area relies on krill - Euphausia superba. Presumably, as a result of climatic fluctuations, a decrease in the number of this crustacean has been recorded, followed by an increase in the population of the gelatinous zooplankter Salpa thompsoni. In the research presented herein, population and morphometric analyses of Salpa thompsoni have been conducted. Specimens for this research were collected from the Drake Passage, using a Bongo net in the summer season of 2010. It has been found that the horizontal distribution of this gelatinous zooplankter was significantly irregular (Kruskal-Wallis test, p<0.001). In the northern part of the investigated area, both blastozooids and oozooids were recorded, which confirms the dynamic development of this species. The central part of the Drake Passage was characterized by the dominance of blastozooids, with embryos found at different stages of the development. Only in the region of the South Shetland Islands, the salpid population was characterized by reduced or even stopped reproduction. The immense reproductive efficiency observed in the Salpa thompsoni population was mostly induced by the favourable thermal conditions. These observations may suggest that the ongoing climat changes in the West Antarctic will promote the population expansion of this species.

Recently, a new multi-enzyme preparation, krill enzyme, isolated from Antarctic shrimp-like organisms (Euphausia superba), was reported to possess powerful proteolytic activity towards protein substrates. In this paper, we study the in vitro digestive properties of krill enzymes towards whole tissue, compared with placebo, papain, and fibrinolysin/DNAse. Freshly obtained skin specimens were exposed for 3 days to krill enzymes (3; 0.6 and 0.06 U/ml), papain (120; 60; 6 and 0.6 U/ml), fibrinolysin/DNAse (2.5/1500 E and 1/600 E), and phosphate-buffered saline control solution. Tissue digestion was estimated by measuring wet Wt, dry wt, and histological examination. After 72 hr of exposure to 3 U/ml krill enzymes, the dry wt of the specimens was reduced to 2.7% +/- 1.9 (SEM, n = 5), compared with 31.0% +/- 2.7 for placebo, 25.7% +/- 2.5 for 120 U/ml papain, and 24.5% +/- 3.3 for 2.5/1500 E/ml fibrinolysin/DNAse. The differences between krill enzymes and fibrinolysin/DNAse, papain, and control solution were statistically significant (p < 0.007). These data suggest that krill enzymes are more active than other commonly available proteolytic agents used for wound debridement.

To date, the potential implications of this population shift on the biogeochemical cycling of the limiting micronutrient iron (Fe) and its bioavailability to SO phytoplankton has never been tested. Based on uptake of fecal pellet (FP)released Fe by SO phytoplankton, this study highlights how efficiently krill and salps recycle Fe. To test this, we collected FPs of natural populations of salps and krill, added them to the same SO phytoplankton community, andmeasured the community's Fe uptake rates. Our results reveal that both FP additions yielded similar dissolved iron concentrations in the seawater. Per FP carbon added to the seawater, 4.8 +/- 1.5 times more Fe was taken up by the same phytoplankton community from salp FP than from krill FP, suggesting that salp FP increased the Fe bioavailability, possibly through the release of ligands. With respect to the ongoing shift from krill to salps, the potential for carbon fixation of the Fe-limited SO could be strengthened in the future, representing a negative feedback to climate change.

Krill lipids are primarily derived from their diet of plankton, in particular diatoms and flagellates. Few attempts have been made to link the spatial and temporal variations in krill lipids to those in their food supply. Remotely-sensed environmental parameters provide large-scale information on the potential availability of krill food, although relating this to physiological and biochemical differences has only been performed on small scales and with limited samples. Our study utilised remotely-sensed data (chlorophyll a and sea surface temperature) coupled with krill lipid data obtained from 3 years of fishery-derived samples. We examined within and between year variation of trends in both the environment and krill biochemistry data. Chlorophyll a levels were positively related to krill lipid levels, particularly triacylglycerol. Plankton fatty acid biomarkers analysed in krill (such as n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids) increased with decreasing sea surface temperature and increasing chlorophyll a levels. Our study demonstrates the utility of combining remote-sensing and biochemical data in examining biological and physiological relationships between Antarctic krill and the Southern Ocean environment.

J	Atkinson, A; Siegel, V; Pakhomov, E; Rothery, P				Atkinson, A; Siegel, V; Pakhomov, E; Rothery, P			Long-term decline in krill stock and increase in salps within the Southern Ocean	NATURE												Antarctic krill ( Euphausia superba) and salps ( mainly Salpa thompsoni) are major grazers in the Southern Ocean(1-4), and krill support commercial fisheries(5). Their density distributions(1,3,4,6) have been described in the period 1926 - 51, while recent localized studies(7-10) suggest short-term changes. To examine spatial and temporal changes over larger scales, we have combined all available scientific net sampling data from 1926 to 2003. This database shows that the productive southwest Atlantic sector contains > 50% of Southern Ocean krill stocks, but here their density has declined since the 1970s. Spatially, within their habitat, summer krill density correlates positively with chlorophyll concentrations. Temporally, within the southwest Atlantic, summer krill densities correlate positively with sea-ice extent the previous winter. Summer food and the extent of winter sea ice are thus key factors in the high krill densities observed in the southwest Atlantic Ocean. Krill need the summer phytoplankton blooms of this sector, where winters of extensive sea ice mean plentiful winter food from ice algae, promoting larval recruitment(7-11) and replenishing the stock. Salps, by contrast, occupy the extensive lower-productivity regions of the Southern Ocean and tolerate warmer water than krill(2-4,12). As krill densities decreased last century, salps appear to have increased in the southern part of their range. These changes have had profound effects within the Southern Ocean food web(10,13).																	0028-0836	1476-4687				NOV 4	2004	432	7013					100	103		10.1038/nature02996							WOS:000224854900048	15525989

Environmental influences on zooplankton and micronekton distribution in the Bransfield Strait and adjacent waters	POLAR BIOLOGY												The spatial distribution, biomass and size structure of key mesozooplankton species and micronekton in the Bransfield Strait (Antarctica) are described in relation to environmental variables during the austral summer 2001. Stratified (BIONESS) biological sampling at five depth-ranges and CTD casts were performed at 40 stations, including a cross-Strait transect. Six families, 11 genera and 16 species composed the total catch of larval and juvenile fish, which were more abundant in the upper 75 m. Trematomus scotti was the most abundant fish and large individuals dominated at depths > 75 m. The fish distribution patterns were associated with the main water masses in the area and with bottom depth. Spatial segregation in density and biomass of krill (Euphausia superba) and salps (Salpa thompsoni) was observed at a relatively small scale, in relation to the main water masses. Also, size-related spatial segregation was found in krill. The present study suggests that the spatial distribution of krill, salps and early life stages of fish, are influenced by the main water masses in the Strait, and that species may adapt their reproductive strategies not only to seasonal production peaks, but to transport processes within water bodies that maximise their fitness through optimum temperature and/or trophic environments.

Cuttlefish, Sepia officinalis, were given meals of krill slurry (Euphausia superba). Protein extracts of contents from four regions of the digestive tract, stomach, caecum, digestive gland and intestine, were tested for prey antigenicity. Digestion times (loss of antigenicity) ranged from 1 to 8 h depending on sampling site. Stomach and caecum emptied rapidly, but meal antigenicity persisted longer in the digestive gland. The Sepia experiments provide a basis for interpretation of results from natural predation by cephalopods.																	0025-3154	1469-7769				AUG	1992	72	3					543	551		10.1017/S0025315400059336							WOS:A1992JK83000004

Interannual to diurnal variability in the near-surface scattering layer in Drake Passage	ICES JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE												Backscattering strength was estimated from 127 shipboard surveys with an acoustic Doppler current profiler (ADCP) made during Drake Passage transits from 1999 to 2004. The backscattering strength is used to determine the characteristics of the near-surface scattering layer, which south of the Southern Antarctic Circumpolar Current Front (SACCF) is dominated by Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba). Diel vertical migration in the upper 150 m was the dominant variability observed in any single transect. When averaged over depth, there was a well-defined annual cycle in backscattering strength, with a factor of four increase from a late-winter minimum to a spring-summer maximum over a period of four months, followed by a more gentle decline during late summer and autumn. in addition, there were significant differences in scattering strength north and south of the Polar Front (PF) on both seasonal and interannnual time-scales. The average summer maximum to the north of the PF was more than twice the maximum to the south, but the winter minima were about the same. On interannual time-scales, scattering strength south of the PF displayed a negative linear trend primarily attributable to a fourfold decrease in backscattering strength south of the SACCF. No significant long-term trend in the scattering strength north of the SACCF was observed.																	1054-3139	1095-9289				DEC	2007	64	9					1617	1626		10.1093/icesjms/fsm138							WOS:000252019300001

The first and last surveys covered a 105 by 105 n mile study area centered on Elephant Island; the second and third surveys covered a 60 by 35 n mile area immediately north of Elephant Island. During the first survey, krill were distributed in a wide band extending along the north side of Elephant Island and wrapping around the western end; biomass was estimated to be 2.2 million metric tons (t). During the second survey, the highest densities of krill were over the shelf extending to the northwest from Elephant Island and including the Seal Island archipelago; high densities of krill also extended off the shelf from the northeast end of Elephant Island into deeper water. Biomass in the smaller survey area was estimated to be 0.7 million t. Three weeks later, high krill densities were still apparent in the vicinity of Seal Island, but the area of high density previously mapped off the northeast end of Elephant Island has diminished considerably; biomass was estimated to be 0.4 million t. During the final survey, conducted 6 wk after the first survey, krill were mapped in reduced densities primarily to the west of Elephant Island; biomass over the larger survey area had declined to 1.1 million t.																	0171-8630					SEP	1993	99	1-2					29	39		10.3354/meps099029							WOS:A1993LY00300003

The impacts of this change can be seen in these ecosystems from primary producers to top predators, through biological, chemical and physical systems. We apply a Lagrangian particle tracking method to investigate transport processes from the retreating sea ice edge in the Southern Ocean during spring and summer. The resulting distribution of surface krill patches is used as a case study for our modelling approach. Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba), a secondary producer, plays a key role in the Southern Ocean ecosystems. Antarctic krill are highly abundant in the Southern Ocean with a complex distribution pattern both in the horizontal and vertical dimensions. Observations dating back to the 1930s show that juvenile krill often form surface patches - high density clusters of krill at the ocean surface - throughout the Southern Ocean during the spring and summer seasons. We develop a hypothesis, based on historical observations, that surface krill patches composed of juvenile krill move passively with ocean currents after their release from the sea ice edge zone in spring. Applying this hypothesis and method to the Southern Hemisphere spring/summer, leads to results that indicate that the observed changes in distribution of krill patches from historical to contemporary records could be related to the southward shift of the sea ice edge over the last century.

Impact of submarine hydrothermal vents on the metal composition of krill and its excretion products	MARINE CHEMISTRY												We have measured the metal composition and estimated the excretion rate of trace elements (Ag, Cd, Co, Cu. Ni. Pb, V and Zn) by Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) in three locations (two located within a submarine hydrothermal vent field and one away from it) along the Antarctic Peninsula region of the Southern ocean. Results indicated that krill excreted large amounts of Ag, Cu, Ph and Zn, (range: 1.9-41.2 pmol Ag g DW-1 h(-1), 15.3-26.8 nmol Cu g DW-1 h(-1), 308.7-1118.3 pmol Ph g DW-1 h(-1) and 24.4-76.5 nmol Zn g DW-1 h(-1)), compared with the non-significant or undetectable release rates of Cd, Co, Ni and V. The metal composition of the excreted material from krill collected in the area of hydrothermal activity was similar to the metal composition reported for suspended particles emitted from those vents. Our results suggest that krill recycling of Ag, Cu, Pb and Zn could potentially influence trace metal concentrations in the water column of the Bransfield region of the Southern Ocean, and that the original source of metals to these waters may be hydrothermal vents.

The dominant species were the copepod Metridia gerlachei and the euphausiid Euphausia superba. We observed a vertical krill/copepod substitution in the water column. The zooplankton biomass in the layer at a depth of 200-500 m was of the same magnitude as the biomass in the layer at a depth of 0-200 m, indicating that biomass in the mesopelagic zone is an important fraction of the total zooplankton in Antarctic waters. The metabolic rates of the zooplankton community were sustained by less than 0.5% of the primary production in the area, suggesting that microplankton or small copepods are the main food source. Neither food availability nor predation seemed to control mesozooplankton biomass. The wide time lag between the abundance peak of the dominant copepod (M. gerlachei) and the phytoplankton bloom is suggested to be the main explanation for the low summer zooplankton biomass observed in these waters.

Copepods were found to be the most conspicuous grazers along the entire transect, generally accounting for approximate to 40% of total zooplankton grazing. Pelagic pteropods, Limacina helicina and Clio sulcata, were the second most important grazers within the Seasonal Ice Edge (SIE) region, while the tunicate Salpa thompsoni and euphausiids, mainly Euphausia superba and E. frigida, were the second and third most important consumers of the phytoplankton production within the Winter Ice Edge (WIE) and Antarctic Polar Front (APF) regions. The overall ingestion rates of the zooplankton community ranged from 24 to 277mg Cm-2 day(-1). The lowest and highest ingestion rates were recorded within the SIE and APF regions. The zooplankton grazing impact was low within the SIE region accounting for < 10% of daily primary production.

J	Thorpe, SE; Heywood, KJ; Stevens, DP; Brandon, MA				Thorpe, SE; Heywood, KJ; Stevens, DP; Brandon, MA			Tracking passive drifters in a high resolution ocean model: implications for interannual variability of larval krill transport to South Georgia	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART I-OCEANOGRAPHIC RESEARCH PAPERS												A particle tracking scheme that uses velocity output from an interannually varying forced run of a global ocean circulation model (Parallel Ocean Climate Model; POCM_4C) allows variability in the transport pathways across the Scotia Sea to South Georgia to be examined for the first time. The time-variant surface fluxes introduce realistic variability into the model velocity fields. This causes large variations in near-surface, mixed-layer transport from the Antarctic Peninsula region to South Georgia, an island in the southwest Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean. The variability occurs on a variety of timescales with seasonal and longer periods of variability apparent in the 18 year time series of results. A quasi-four year period of variability is evident across the region in the sea surface temperature fields of POCM_4C and appears in the particle tracking results. This period, noted in other Southern Ocean data sets and ascribed to the Antarctic Circumpolar Wave, has been observed in the reproductive success of higher marine predators breeding on the island. The predicted oceanographic variability is likely to be significant for the South Georgia ecosystem by affecting the influx into the region of Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba), the main prey of the higher predators.

A cruise of the Southern Ocean GLOBEC program (NBP0103) in April/May 2001 permitted an evaluation of the efficacy of a high-powered strobe light (150 W) mounted on a 1-m(2) multiple opening/closing net and environmental sampling system (MOCNESS) in reducing net avoidance. Three horizontal tows were made in Laubeuf Fjord, Marguerite Bay (western Antarctic Peninsula, 67.89degreesS; 68.30 W) on 28-29 May in an area that had a high abundance of adult krill (mostly Euphausia superba, Dana and a few E. crystallorophias, Holt and Tattersall). Each tow consisted of a series of paired down and up casts through a set depth interval (e.g. 50-90 m), with each successive net (335 mum mesh) sampling both a down and up cast. The strobe light was either "on" or "off" while each net was open, and when on, the light flashed at 4-s intervals. During a tow, four of the eight nets sampled with the strobe flashing and four sampled with the strobe off, in a random sequence. Total zooplankton displacement volume was significantly higher (P<0.0 5), on average by a factor of similar to 1.5, when the strobe light was on. The increased biovolume was due to the enhanced catch (factor of similar to 2) of adult krill (15-60 mm length). There was no enhanced catch of smaller krill (5-15 mm length: a mixture of E. superba, E. crystallorophias, and Thysanoessa macrura, GO Sars). In addition, the average length of the large krill fraction was not changed substantially with the strobe light on. These results suggest that krill avoidance of nets can be overcome by intense strobe lighting.

Effects of partial or total replacement of fish meal with freeze-dried krill (Euphausia superba) on growth and nutrient utilization of juvenile Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) and Atlantic halibut (Hippoglossus hippoglossus) fed the same practical diets	AQUACULTURE NUTRITION												Studies were conducted with juvenile (28 g) Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) and halibut (Hippoglossus hippoglossus) fed fish meal (FM) based diets with partial (0%, 25%, 50% and 75%) or total (100%) replacement of FM with freeze-dried krill (FDK). Addition of dietary FDK significantly stimulated feeding activity in both species and resulted in higher feed consumption and intakes of digestible protein (DP) and energy (DE). This is a significant finding on the feed attractant properties of FDK because it occurred despite having 2-4 MJ kg(-1) higher levels of DE in the FDK diets which could have had an intake suppression effect. In addition, it indicates that the soluble protein fraction of krill thought to be responsible for its attractant properties and is routinely lost or greatly reduced during commercial processing of krill meals, is retained by freeze-drying. Supplementation of FDK significantly improved growth rates, digestibility and nutrient utilization. Levels exceeding 25-50% FM replacement, however, generally did not significantly increase growth performance or nutrient utilization. In addition, feed formulations with high FDK (> 75% replacement) are likely to be cost-prohibitive as long as the market price remains higher than FM.

J	Donnelly, J; Sutton, TT; Torres, JJ				Donnelly, J; Sutton, TT; Torres, JJ			Distribution and abundance of micronekton and macrozooplankton in the NW Weddell Sea: relation to a spring ice-edge bloom	POLAR BIOLOGY												Micronekton and macrozooplankton were collected during the austral spring of 1993 in the NW Weddell Sea. Sampling was done in three areas of the marginal ice zone: pack ice, ice edge, and open water, to examine the short-term effects of the spring phytoplankton bloom on the distribution and abundance of dominant fish and invertebrate species. Significant differences were observed for several common species, including Salpa thompsoni,Euphausia superba, Electrona antarctica, Gymnoscopelus braueri,and G. opisthopterus. Increased abundance seaward of the pack ice for these species is attributed to elevated phytoplankton and zooplankton biomass at the ice edge and in the open water areas. Distribution of the hyperiid amphipods, Cyllopus lucasii and Vibilia stebbingi mirrored that of S. thompsoni. No distributional trends between the areas were observed for Thysanoessa macrura, the amphipods Cyphocaris richardi and Primno macropa, the decapod shrimp Pasiphaea scotiae, the scyphomedusae Atolla wyvilli and Periphylla periphylla, and chaetognaths, indicating a trophic independence from the ice-edge bloom for these species. Lower occurrence of the mesopelagic fish Bathylagus antarcticus and Cyclothone microdon under the ice suggested that trophic repercussions of the spring bloom can also extend to deeper living species.

Stomach content analysis showed that both species are piscivorous predators but with different feeding habits. Cygnodraco mawsoni fed mostly on young notothenioid fish, regularly complementing these with pelagic, Euphausia superba, and benthic crustaceans, such as amphipod gammarids and mysids. In contrast, G. acuticeps relied mostly on mesopelagic fish of the family Myctophidae. Although C. mawsoni and G. acuticeps occupy similar depths in the Cosmonaut Sea, different feeding habits appear to limit the probability of interspecific competition for food.																	0954-1020					MAR	1998	10	1					55	61		10.1017/S095410209800008X							WOS:000072760800008

Understanding these patterns of movement is important for informing marine ecosystem management and for understanding ecological processes generally. Retention of biological particles in a particular area due to ocean currents has received less attention than transport pathways, particularly for the Southern Ocean. We present a method for modelling retention time, based on the half-life for particles in a particular region, that is relevant for biological processes. This method uses geostrophic velocities at the ocean surface, derived from 23 years of satellite altimetry data (1993-2016), to simulate the advection of passive particles during the Southern Hemisphere summer season (from December to March). We assess spatial patterns in the retention time of passive particles and evaluate the processes affecting these patterns for the Indian sector of the Southern Ocean. Our results indicate that the distribution of retention time is related to bathymetric features and the resulting ocean dynamics. Our analysis also reveals a moderate level of consistency between spatial patterns of retention time and observations of Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) distribution.

Temporal variation in trophic relationships among three congeneric penguin species breeding in sympatry	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION												Penguins are a monophyletic group in which many species are found breeding sympatrically, raising questions regarding how these species coexist successfully. Here, the isotopic niche of three sympatric pygoscelid penguin species was investigated at Powell Island, South Orkney Islands, during two breeding seasons (austral summers 2013-2014 and 2015-2016). Measurements of carbon (C-13) and nitrogen (N-15) stable isotope ratios were obtained from blood (adults) or feather (chicks) samples collected from Adelie Pygoscelis adeliae, chinstrap P.antarctica, and gentoo P.papua penguins. Isotopic niche regions (a proxy for the realized trophic niches) were computed to provide estimates of the trophic niche width of the studied species during the breeding season. The isotopic niche regions of adults of all three species were similar, but gentoo chicks had noticeably wider isotopic niches than the chicks of the other two species. Moderate to strong overlap in isotopic niche among species was found during each breeding season and for both age groups, suggesting that the potential for competition for shared food sources was similar during the two study years, although the actual level of competition could not be determined owing to the lack of data on resource abundance. Clear interannual shifts in isotopic niche were seen in all three species, though of lower amplitude for adult chinstrap penguins. These shifts were due to variation in carbon, but not nitrogen, isotopic ratios, which could indicate either a change in isotopic signature of their prey or a switch to an alternative food web. The main conclusions of this study are that (1) there is a partial overlap in the isotopic niches of these three congeneric species and that (2) they responded similarly to changes that likely occurred at the base of their food chain between the 2years of the study.

Estimates obtained from the stomach capacity and respiratory allometry methods differed by 17%-23%. An "average-sized" male Minke whale consumes 37.2 t of krill during a 90-day stay, and an "average-sized" female Minke whale consumes 56.2 t of krill during a 120-day stay, in Antarctic waters during the austral summer. It is estimated that the Minke whale population in the Antarctic (60-degrees-S and higher) consumes 35.5 x 10(6) t of krill annually.																	0954-1020					MAR	1991	3	1					13	18		10.1017/S0954102091000044							WOS:A1991FB09900003

We investigated survival rate of calyptopis larvae of Euphausia superba and late copepodite stages (IV and V) of large dominant calanoid species, Calanoides acutus and Calanus propinquus reared in quartz jars with three different radiation regimes (total radiation, exclusion of UVB, exclusion of UVA and UVB) and a dark control. The survival rates of the krill larvae decreased after 3 days from start of the experiment, being below 50% at 4 days in the treatments with total radiation and exclusion of UVB, although most individuals could survive until the end of the experiments in the treatments with exclusion of both UVA and UVB and dark control. The calanoid juveniles showed almost same pattern of survival curves as the krill larvae did, but survived slightly longer. Although > 10% of surface UVA radiation at 340 and 380 nm penetrated down to 30 m, both C. acutus and C. propinquus were mostly distributed above 20 m. Surface swarm of the krill larvae can be often recognized in the previous studies. These results suggest that not only solar UVB but also UVA radiation potentially lower the survival rate of Antarctic zooplankton at depth less than 20 m.

Regression analyses clearly showed that blubber thickness, girth and fat weight have been decreasing for nearly 2 decades. The decrease per year is estimated at approximately 0.02 cm for mid-lateral blubber thickness and 17 kg for fat weight, corresponding to 9% for both measurements over the 18-year period. Furthermore, "date", "extent of diatom adhesion", "sex", "body length", "fetus length", "latitude", "age" and "longitude" were all identified as partially independent predictors of blubber thickness. The direct interpretation of this substantial decline in energy storage in terms of food availability is difficult, since no long-term krill abundance series is available. However, an increase in the abundance of krill feeders other than minke whales and a resulting decrease in the krill population must be considered as a likely explanation.				walloe, lars/P-6947-2018	Konishi, Kenji/0000-0002-6120-9903												0722-4060	1432-2056				NOV	2008	31	12					1509	1520		10.1007/s00300-008-0491-3							WOS:000260017200009

It is concluded that on a Southern Ocean scale it is currently not possible to detect change but on a local scale, such as at South Georgia, major changes are detectable.

Ocean acidification, caused by sequestration of carbon dioxide into ocean surface waters (pCO(2)), alters the lipid biochemistry of some organisms. This can have cascading effects up the food chain. In a year-long laboratory experiment adult krill were exposed to ambient seawater pCO(2) levels (400 mu atm), elevated pCO(2) levels mimicking near-future ocean acidification (1000, 1500 and 2000 mu atm) and an extreme pCO(3) level (4000 mu atm). Total lipid mass (mg g(-1) DM) of krill was unaffected by near-future pCO(2). Fatty acid composition (%) and fatty acid ratios associated with immune responses and cell membrane fluidity were also unaffected by near-future pCO(2), apart from an increase in 18:3n-3/18:2n-6 ratios in krill in 1500 mu atm pCO(2) in winter and spring. Extreme pCO(2) had no effect on krill lipid biochemistry during summer. During winter and spring, krill in extreme pCO(2) had elevated levels of 18:2n-6 (up to 1.2% increase), 20:4n-6 (up to 0.8% increase), lower 18:3n-3/18:2n-6 and 20:5n-3/20:4n-6 ratios, and showed evidence of increased membrane fluidity (up to three-fold increase in phospholipid/sterol ratios). These results indicate that the lipid biochemistry of adult krill is robust to near-future ocean acidification.

Therefore, they can compete with krill for primary production. Over the last three decades, significant variability in S. thompsoni occurrence has been observed as a response to the environmental fluctuations of the Southern Ocean ecosystem (e.g. changes in sea surface temperature and ice-cover shrinkage around the cold Antarctic waters). This study presents historical abundance data of salps from the south-west Atlantic Sector of the Southern Ocean, covering a time span of 26 years. These data allow tracking of fluctuations in Antarctic salp abundance and their distribution with bottom depth, temperature, and ice conditions, aiming to reveal salp hot spots and to predict the future range of S. thompsoni distribution with upcoming climate warming in the next 50 years. Results showed the highest salp density in shallow shelf waters with ice cover and low temperatures between 1 and -1 degrees C. In the studied area, S. thompsoni hot spots were located mostly around Elephant Island, but also the islands around Brensfield and Gerlache Straits, as well as to the south near the Bellingshausen Sea. Inferences made of future salp distribution suggest that the range of S. thompsoni will move southwards, enlarging their habitat area by nearly 500,000 km(2), which may have significant implications on the whole Antarctic food web. The information presented herein may be used for Antarctic ecosystem management, protection, and conservation.

Bioinformatic analyses of the publicly accessible crustacean expressed sequence tags (ESTs) reveal numerous novel neuropeptide-encoding precursor proteins, including ones from members of several little studied taxa	GENERAL AND COMPARATIVE ENDOCRINOLOGY												ESTs have been generated for many crustacean species, providing an invaluable resource for peptide discovery in members of this arthropod subphylum. Here, these data were mined for novel peptide-encoding transcripts, with the mature peptides encoded by them predicted using a combination of online peptide prediction programs and homology to known arthropod sequences. In total, 70 mature full-length/partial peptides representing members of 16 families/subfamilies were predicted, the vast majority being novel; the species from which the peptides were identified included members of the Branchiopoda (Daphnia carinata and Triops cancriformis), Maxillopoda (Caligus clemensi, Caligus rogercresseyi, Lepeophtheirus salmonis and Lernaeocera branchialis) and Malacostraca (Euphausia superba, Marsupenaeus japonicus, Penaeus monodon, Homarus americanus, Petrolisthes cinctipes, Callinectes sapidus and Portunus trituberculatus). Of particular note were the identifications of an intermediate between the insect adipokinetic hormones and crustacean red pigment concentrating hormone and a modified crustacean cardioactive peptide from the daphnid D. carinata: Arg(7)-corazonin was also deduced from this species, the first identification of a corazonin from a non-decapod crustacean. Our data also include the first reports of members of the calcitonin-like diuretic hormone, FMRFamide-related peptide (neuropeptide F subfamily) and orcokinin families from members of the Copepoda. Moreover, the prediction of a bursicon alpha from the euphausid E. superb represents the first peptide identified from any member of the basal eucaridean order Euphausiacea. In addition, large collections of insect eclosion hormone- and neuroparsin-like peptides were identified from a variety of species, greatly expanding the number of known members of these families in crustaceans.

Intra-seasonal variation in foraging behavior among Ad,lie penguins (Pygocelis adeliae) breeding at Cape Hallett, Ross Sea, Antarctica	POLAR BIOLOGY												We investigated intra-seasonal variation in foraging behavior of chick-rearing Ad,lie penguins, Pygoscelis adeliae, during two consecutive summers at Cape Hallett, northwestern Ross Sea. Although foraging behavior of this species has been extensively studied throughout the broad continental shelf region of the Ross Sea, this is the first study to report foraging behaviors and habitat affiliations among birds occupying continental slope waters. Continental slope habitat supports the greatest abundances of this species throughout its range, but we lack information about how intra-specific competition for prey might affect foraging and at-sea distribution and how these attributes compare with previous Ross Sea studies. Foraging trips increased in both distance and duration as breeding advanced from guard to crSche stage, but foraging dive depth, dive rates, and vertical dive distances travelled per hour decreased. Consistent with previous studies within slope habitats elsewhere in Antarctic waters, Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) dominated chick meal composition, but fish increased four-fold from guard to crSche stages. Foraging-, focal-, and core areas all doubled during the crSche stage as individuals shifted distribution in a southeasterly direction away from the coast while simultaneously becoming more widely dispersed (i.e., less spatial overlap among individuals). Intra-specific competition for prey among Ad,lie penguins appears to influence foraging behavior of this species, even in food webs dominated by Antarctic krill.

Simultaneous surveys of marine birds, Antarctic fur seals and Antarctic krill were conducted along a series of transects radiating from the breeding colonies of the vertebrate predators. We examined the relationships between the distributions of predators and their prey with respect to the abundance of krill in the water column and marine habitats near the colonies. Antarctic fur seals and macaroni penguins showed positive correlations with Antarctic krill density across a wide range of spatial scales. Because krill was abundant close to the colony and predator densities decreased with distance due to geometry, distance from colony was a confounding variable. When the influences of distance and direction on predator abundance were factored out, we were able to demonstrate an additional influence of Antarctic krill abundance at measurement scales between 10 and 100 km for Antarctic fur seals and for macaroni penguins at the scale of 70 to 100 km. Water depth was an important correlate of Antarctic krill and Antarctic fur seal abundances but not of the abundance of macaroni penguins. We found no evidence that the fur seals or macaroni penguins were concentrating their foraging for krill in the vicinity of the shelf-break.

J	McGehee, DE; O'Driscoll, RL; Traykovski, LVM				McGehee, DE; O'Driscoll, RL; Traykovski, LVM			Effects of orientation on acoustic scattering from Antarctic krill at 120 kHz	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY												Backscattering measurements of 14 live individual Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) were made at a frequency of 120 kHz in a chilled insulated tank at the Long Marine Laboratory in Santa Cruz, CA. Individual animals were suspended in front of the transducers, were only loosely constrained, had substantial freedom to move, and showed more or less random orientation. One thousand echoes were collected per animal. Orientation data were recorded on video, The acoustic data were analyzed and target strengths determined from each echo. A method was developed for estimating the three-dimensional orientation of the krill based on the video images and was applied to five of them, giving their target strengths as functions of orientation. Scattering models based on a simplified distorted-wave Born approximation (DWBA) method were developed for five animals and compared with the measurements. Both measured and modeled scattering patterns showed that 120 kHz acoustic scattering levels are highly dependent on animal orientation. Use of these scattering patterns with orientation data from shipboard studies of E. superba gave mean scattering levels approximately 12 dB lower than peak levels. These results underscore the need for better in situ behavioral data to properly interpret acoustic survey results. A generic E. superba DWBA scattering model is proposed that is scalable by animal length. With good orientation information, this model could significantly improve the precision and accuracy of krill acoustic surveys. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Individuals used in the analyses were captured during fall and winter; for 8 species data were collected in both seasons. Seven of the 8 species showed some evidence that combustion of body stores were an aid to surviving the winter months; comparison with data from other investigators suggests that most of the species inhabiting shallow and mid-depths exhibit some degree of combustion of body stores during winter. Three types of overwintering strategies are proposed for Antarctic zooplankton and micronekton. Type 1, exhibited by some calanoid copepods, is characterized by accumulation of large lipid deposits and a true dormancy, or diapause, during winter. Type 2, exhibited by euphausiids and hyperiid amphipods, is characterized by a marked reduction in metabolic rate, combustion of body substance, opportunistic feeding, but no true dormancy. Type 3, 'business as usual' is exhibited by decapods and gammarid amphipods; it is characterized by an absence of a winter reduction in metabolic rate, combustion of body stores in some species but a lack of combustion or accumulation of energy in others, and opportunistic feeding. Over-wintering scenarios computed for Euphausia superba suggest that the impact of the winter season is most severe in the smaller size classes.																	0171-8630					OCT	1994	113	3					221	232		10.3354/meps113221							WOS:A1994PR37100002

Ecosystem modelling to quantify the impact of historical whaling on Southern Hemisphere baleen whales	FISH AND FISHERIES												Many baleen whales were commercially harvested during the 20th century almost to extinction. Reliable assessments of how this mass depletion impacted whale populations, and projections of their recovery, are crucial but there are uncertainties regarding the status of Southern Hemisphere whale populations. We developed a Southern Hemisphere spatial Model of Intermediate Complexity for Ecosystem Assessments (MICE) for phytoplankton, krill (Euphausia superba) and five baleen whale species, to estimate whale population trajectories from 1890 to present. To forward project to 2100, we couple the predator-prey model to a global climate model. We used the most up to date catch records, fitted to survey data and accounted for key uncertainties. We predict Antarctic blue (Balaenoptera musculus intermedia), fin (Balaenoptera physalus) and southern right (Eubalaena australis) whales will be at less than half their pre-exploitation numbers (K) even given 100years of future protection from whaling, because of slow growth rates. Some species have benefited greatly from cessation of harvesting, particularly humpbacks (Megaptera novaeangliae), currently at 32% of K, with full recovery predicted by 2050. We highlight spatial differences in the recovery of whale species between oceanic areas, with current estimates of Atlantic/Indian area blue (1,890, <1% of K) and fin (16,950, <4% of K) whales suggesting slower recovery from harvesting, whilst Pacific southern right numbers are <7% of K (2,680). Antarctic minke (Balaenoptera bonaerensis) population trajectories track future expected increases in primary productivity. Population estimates and plausible future predicted trajectories for Southern Hemisphere baleen whales are key requirements for management and conservation.

One of these communities is dominated by the Antarctic krill Euphausia superba. This community was located mainly along the continental shelf edge, usually between the offshore main oceanic community dominated by copepods and chaetognaths, and the neritic community dominated by E. crystallorophias. In January to March 1991, the Prydz Bay continental shelf area was the subject of a more intensive mesoscale survey to more accurately define the distribution patterns of the 3 zooplankton communities in that area. Cluster analysis and non-metric multidimensional scaling were used to define the communities, their distribution patterns, indicator species and species affinities. The composition of the communities were much the same as previously defined. E. superba again exhibited a distinct dissociation from all other species. However, the distribution pattern of the krill-dominated community was different from those previously observed. That community did not separate the copepod- and E. crystallorophias-dominated communities in Prydz Bay and apparently was displaced to the west. Temperature was strongly correlated with the zooplankton community distribution patterns, suggesting that temperature has more influence at the mesoscale level than at larger scales. Sea ice patterns, chlorophyll a abundance and salinity were also correlated, to a lesser extent, with the community distribution patterns.																	0171-8630					MAR	1994	106	1-2					21	39		10.3354/meps106021							WOS:A1994NB76600003

We projected growth trajectories for individual krill within cohorts and estimated how total biomass in an area available to both predators and the fishery may vary from year to year simply due to fluctuations in temperature. We used an existing temperature-dependent growth model and a time series of temperature data (1970 to 2004) for 2 regions in the Southern Ocean: (1) around the Antarctic Peninsula, and (2) around the island of South Georgia. The growth model predicted increasing individual size within a cohort (in terms of length and weight) with increasing temperature in the cooler Antarctic Peninsula region and decreasing individual size with increasing temperature in the warmer South Georgia region. Years with many cohorts of small individuals in the population resulted in biomass well below average, whereas years with many cohorts of large individuals resulted in biomass well above the average, suggesting that temporal changes in Southern Ocean temperatures may have profound effects on the total biomass in an area that is available to both predators and the fishery. Moreover, the effects of a potentially warming Southern Ocean on krill biomass will likely be more pronounced in the warmer regions occupied by krill.

EFFECTS OF RECRUITMENT VARIABILITY AND NATURAL MORTALITY ON GENERALISED YIELD MODEL PROJECTIONS AND THE CCAMLR DECISION RULES FOR ANTARCTIC KRILL	CCAMLR SCIENCE												The generalised yield model (GYM) was used by CCAMLR to establish the precautionary catch limit for the Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) fishery. The current precautionary catch limit was based on supplying the GYM with a natural mortality rate of 0.8 and recruitment variability generated using a Beta distribution for proportional recruitment of krill. In this study, krill sampling data for empirical size frequencies were supplied to the GYM as the 'vector of recruitments' input option to simulate the population dynamics of krill around the Antarctic Peninsula (Subarea 48.1) along with increasing rates of natural mortality. The annual proportions of krill less than 36 mm in length to the total captured in net samples in four sampling areas of the Peninsula were used as proxies for recruitment variability. The variability of proportional recruitment in the CCAMLR study areas was similar to the variability in other krill studies and in the annual size distributions of krill in penguin diets. Simulations with either no fishing, or with fishing at the trigger level (lowest catches), at approximately half the precautionary catch limit (intermediate), or at the precautionary catch limit (highest) were conducted. As the values for natural mortality, recruitment variability and catch were increased, fewer of the scenarios were able to meet the CCAMLR decision rules. The higher precautionary level of catch was not obtainable while meeting CCAMLR decision criteria for at least two of the four recruitment vectors based on net sampling, regardless of how the specified parameters for recruitment and mortality were combined. Any substantial future increases in krill harvests in Area 48 beyond the trigger level require verification that the krill recruitment variability, natural mortality, and other parameters specified in the scenarios used to test management criteria, adequately represent the range of plausible values encompassing krill population biology.																	1023-4063						2013	20						81	96									WOS:000326924700006

Information on the reproductive status of S. thompsoni in the high Southern Ocean is thus essential to understanding salp population growth and predicting changes in the Southern Ocean ecosystem. We carried out stratified and quantitative sampling from the surface to a depth of 2000 m during the austral summer of 2008 to determine the spatial distribution and population structure of S. thompsoni in the Southern Ocean off Adelie Land. We found two salp species, S. thompsoni and Ihlea racovitzai, with the former being dominant. S. thompsoni was distributed north of the continental slope area, while I. racovitzai was observed in the neritic zone. Mature aggregates and solitary specimens of S. thompsoni were found south of the Southern Boundary of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current, suggesting that S. thompsoni is able to complete its life cycle in high Antarctic waters during the austral summer. However, S. thompsoni was sparsely distributed in the continental slope area, and absent south of the Antarctic Slope Front, suggesting that it is less competitive with krill for food in the slope area off Adelie Land, where krill is densely distributed during the austral summer.

Up to 19 seabird species plus Antarctic fur seals (Arctocephalus gazella) were involved. Black-browed Albatross (Diomedea melanophris), Macaroni Penguins (Eudyptes chrysolophus), and prions (Pachyptila spp.) were the most abundant species. Most flocks were in the vicinity of a large inshore patch of Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba), and most observed feeding was by Black-browed Albatross, which appeared to initiate and dominate the flocks. Short feeding bouts by surface-feeding species appeared to be coupled with the surfacing of penguins and seals.

J	Sylvester, ZT; Long, MC; Brooks, CM				Sylvester, Zephyr T.; Long, Matthew C.; Brooks, Cassandra M.			Detecting Climate Signals in Southern Ocean Krill Growth Habitat	FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE												Climate change is rapidly altering the habitat of Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba), a key species of the Southern Ocean food web. Krill are a critical element of Southern Ocean ecosystems as well as biogeochemical cycles, while also supporting an international commercial fishery. In addition to trends forced by global-scale, human-driven warming, the Southern Ocean is highly dynamic, displaying large fluctuations in surface climate on interannual to decadal timescales. The dual roles of forced climate change and natural variability affecting Antarctic krill habitat, and therefore productivity, complicate interplay of observed trends and contribute to uncertainty in future projections. We use the Community Earth System Model Large Ensemble (CESM-LE) coupled with an empirically derived model of krill growth to detect and attribute trends associated with "forced," human-driven climate change, distinguishing these from variability arising naturally. The forced trend in krill growth is characterized by a poleward contraction of optimal conditions and an overall reduction in Southern Ocean krill habitat. However, the amplitude of natural climate variability is relatively large, such that the forced trend cannot be formally distinguished from natural variability at local scales over much of the Southern Ocean by 2100. Our results illustrate how natural variability is an important driver of regional krill growth trends and can mask the forced trend until late in the 21st century. Given the ecological and commercial global importance of krill, this research helps inform current and future Southern Ocean krill management in the context of climate variability and change.																		2296-7745				JUN 15	2021	8								669508	10.3389/fmars.2021.669508							WOS:000663821600001

Long-term variability in the diet and reproductive performance of penguins at Bird Island, South Georgia	MARINE BIOLOGY												Inter-annual variability in diet during crsche ( December to February) over 22 years ( 1989-2010) was examined for gentoo penguins Pygoscelis papua breeding at Bird Island, South Georgia ( 54 degrees 00 ' S, 38 degrees 03 degrees W). Overall, diets comprised 51% crustaceans and 49% fish by mass. Crustaceans were present in 89% of samples and were the main prey (> 50% by mass) in 10 years of the study. Antarctic krill Euphausia superba were present in 85% of all diet samples. Fish were present in 79% of samples and were the main prey in 12 years, with Champsocephalus gunnari and Lepidonotothen larseni the most frequently recorded species, in 51 and 33% of samples, respectively. The energy or mass of krill in the diet was the most reliable predictor of breeding success (the number of chicks fledged per breeding pair); the correlation between model-predicted and observed values was 0.58. We compared annual patterns of gentoo penguin diet variability with those of macaroni penguins Eudyptes chrysolophus breeding at the same location. Our results suggest that the availability of krill is a key source of diet variability for both species, but their diets indicate that gentoo penguins are generalist predators (feeding on pelagic and bentho-pelagic prey), while macaroni penguins are krill specialists (feeding on pelagic prey).

J	Reid, K				Reid, K			Growth rates of Antarctic fur seals as indices of environmental conditions	MARINE MAMMAL SCIENCE												The growth rates of Antarctic fur seal (Arctocephalus gazella) pups estimated from weighing cross-sections of the population were compared with measured/ inferred changes in the availability of their main prey species, Antarctic krill (Eupkausia superba) from 1989 to 2000. There was no relationship between growth rate and mass at weaning and there were counter-intuitive indications of higher growth rates in years of low krill availability. Biases reflecting changes in the component of the population available for sampling appear to invalidate the widely held assumption that interannual differences in growth rate can reliably he derived from differences in the slope of a linear relationship based on cross-sectional population samples. A new index was developed, based on the deviation of pup mass at age in each year compared to the multiyear mean, that was not dependent on assumptions of linearity. The indices of growth deviates produced a more logical relationship with other indices of pup development and related more appropriately to variations in prey availability. The potential impact of methodological biases on the interpretation of growth rate suggests that comparisons of growth rates should not rely on assumptions regarding the underlying growth pattern.																	0824-0469	1748-7692				APR	2002	18	2					469	482		10.1111/j.1748-7692.2002.tb01049.x							WOS:000175164000010

Variable food absorption by Antarctic krill: Relationships between diet, egestion rate and the composition and sinking rates of their fecal pellets	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY												The kinetics of food processing by zooplankton affects both their energy budgets and the biogeochemical fate of their fecal pellets. We sampled 40 schools of krill across the Scotia Sea during spring, summer and autumn and found that in all 3 seasons, every aspect of their absorption and defecation varied greatly. The C content of fecal pellets varied from 0.85% to 29% of their dry mass (median 9.8%) and C egestion rates varied 75-fold. C:N mass ratios of pellets ranged from 4.9 to 13.2 (median 7.8), higher than values of 3.9 in the krill and 5.4 in their food, pointing to enhanced uptake of N. Pellet sinking rates equated to 27-1218 m d(-1) (median 304 m d(-1)), being governed mainly by pellet diameter (80-600 mu m, mean 183 mu m) and density (1.038-1.391 g cm(-3), mean 1.121 g cm(-3)). Pellets showed little loss of C or N in filtered seawater over the first 2 days and were physically robust. When feeding rates were low, slow gut passage time and high absorption efficiency resulted in low egestion rates of pellets that were low in C and N content. These pellets were compact, dense and fast-sinking. Conversely, in good feeding conditions much food tended to pass quickly through the gut and was not efficiently absorbed, producing C and N-rich, slow-sinking pellets. Such "superfluous feeding" probably maximises the absolute rates of nutrient absorption. Food composition was also important: diatom-rich diets depressed the C content of the pellets but increased their sinking rates, likely due to silica ballasting. So depending on how krill process food, their pellets could represent both vehicles for rapid export and slow sinking, C and N-rich food sources for pelagic scavengers. C egestion rates by krill averaged 3.4% of summer primary production (and ingestion rates would be 2-10-fold higher than this) so whatever the fate of the pellets, krill are an important re-packager within the food web. While salp pellets tend to sink faster than those of krill, it is the latter that tend to prevail in sediment traps. We suggest that this is because krill schools are more compact, producing "rain showers" of pellets that exceed the capacity of pelagic scavengers to reprocess them. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

The isotopic niche is reflected by the ecological position and functional role of a species, which can be altered depending on these environmental changes. We assessed the isotopic niche and trophic positions (TP) of 3 seabirds on the Barton Peninsula, King George Island, Antarctica, to understand ecological interaction among the species. The average TP of Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) (hereafter "krill") (2.6 +/- 0.1) was estimated by using the compiled published data of the compound-specific nitrogen isotope ratio of glutamic acid and phenylalanine in the Southern Ocean, and TP values of the seabirds based on that of krill to be reliable according to ecological knowledge. Our results on the overlap of the isotopic niches of seabirds suggests potential diet competition among the consumers, such as the brown skua (Stercorarius antarcticus) and south polar skua (Stercorarius maccormicki), whereas the distinct and broad isotopic niche width of kelp gulls (Larus dominicanus) suggesting that their adaptation through generalization was related to their extended habitat and various food sources. Our research indicates that isotopic niche of seabirds reflects their survival strategy for food competition. Consequently, these seabirds can be easily influenced by alternative food sources, including terrestrial and human-derived sources, by rapid environmental changes, indicating that they are valuable as key environmental species and require long-term monitoring in the Antarctic Peninsula.																	0272-7714	1096-0015				SEP 5	2021	258								107443	10.1016/j.ecss.2021.107443							WOS:000679383300001

The catch remained relatively stable at around 120 000 tonnes for 17 years until 2009, but has recently increased to more than 200 000 tonnes. The Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources precautionary catch limits for this species total over 8.6 million tonnes so it remains one of the oceans largest known underexploited stocks. Recent developments in harvesting technology and in products being derived from krill indicate renewed interest in exploiting this resource. At the same time, there are changes in the Southern Ocean environment that are affecting both krill and the fishery. This paper summarizes the current state of this fishery and highlights the changes that are affecting it.

Submesoscale distribution of Antarctic krill and its avian and pinniped predators before and after a near gale	MARINE BIOLOGY												We conducted two ship-based surveys of the nearshore ecosystem north of Livingston Island, Antarctica during 2-10 February 2005. Between the two surveys, a low-pressure system (963 mbar) passed through the area providing the opportunity to measure ecosystem parameters before and after a near gale. A ship-based multiple-frequency acoustic-backscatter survey was used to assess the distribution and relative abundance of Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba). Net tows, hydrographic profiles, and meteorological data were collected to measure biological and physical processes that might affect the krill population. During the survey, the distribution and behavior of several krill predators [chinstrap penguins (Pygoscelis antarctica), cape petrels (Daption capense), and Antarctic fur seals (Arctocephalus gazella)] were measured from the vessel by visual observations. The survey encompassed an area of roughly 2,500 km(2), containing two submarine canyons with one to the west and one to the east of Cape Shirreff, which had different abundances of krill and predators. Several aspects of the nearshore ecosystem changed after the near gale including: hydrography of the upper 100 m of the water column, phytoplankton biomass, the abundance and distribution of krill, and the distribution of some krill predators. Differences in these parameters were also measured between the two canyons. These changes in the physical and biological environment during the survey period are quantified and show that the ecosystem exhibited significant changes over relatively short spatial (tens of kilometers) and time (tens of hours) scales.

Temperature-dependent growth of Thysanoessa macrura: inter-annual and spatial variability around Elephant Island, Antarctica	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												Somatic growth of pelagic invertebrates is controlled by temperature and food, both of which vary in space and time. Species-specific growth rate responses to environmental variability may affect populations through changes in reproductive potential; therefore, measuring spatial and temporal variability in growth rates of highly abundant zooplankton is critical to predict the impact of climate change on pelagic ecosystems. Here, we used length frequencies from bi-annual surveys conducted 1 month apart to estimate growth rates of one the most abundant euphausiids in the Southern Ocean, Thysanoessa macrura. We analyzed summer data from 4 separate years (1995, 1998, 2001, and 2004) that varied widely in temperature and primary production. Stations within the surveys were grouped by water characteristics: warm, low salinity Antarctic Circum polar Current (ACC) water, and cold, saline Bransfield Strait and Weddell Sea (MBW) water, to assess inter-annual and spatial variability in cohort growth. Mid-summer cohort growth rates of T. macrura varied between years and water masses, ranging from -0.037 mm d(-1) in MBW water in 2004 to 0.081 mm d(-1) in ACC water in 1995. Growth rates were faster in ACC water than in MBW water during all years. Growth rates were strongly correlated with temperature (R-2 = 0.82) but weakly correlated with copepod density (R-2 = 0.38), and were not correlated with chl a concentration (R-2 = 0.11). These results suggest that the growth rates of T. macrura may increase in regions exhibiting warming trends, such as the Antarctic Peninsula. This contrasts with published data on the growth rates of Euphausia superba, which is predicted to be impacted negatively by climate warming.																	0171-8630	1616-1599				JUN 8	2015	529						49	61		10.3354/meps11291							WOS:000356076000004

Seabed foraging by Antarctic krill: Implications for stock assessment, bentho-pelagic coupling, and the vertical transfer of iron	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												A compilation of more than 30 studies shows that adult Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) may frequent benthic habitats year-round, in shelf as well as oceanic waters and throughout their circumpolar range. Net and acoustic data from the Scotia Sea show that in summer 2-20% of the population reside at depths between 200 and 2000 m, and that large aggregations can form above the seabed. Local differences in the vertical distribution of krill indicate that reduced feeding success in surface waters, either due to predator encounter or food shortage, might initiate such deep migrations and results in benthic feeding. Fatty acid and microscopic analyses of stomach content confirm two different foraging habitats for Antarctic krill: the upper ocean, where fresh phytoplankton is the main food source, and deeper water or the seabed, where detritus and copepods are consumed. Krill caught in upper waters retain signals of benthic feeding, suggesting frequent and dynamic exchange between surface and seabed. Krill contained up to 260 nmol iron per stomach when returning from seabed feeding. About 5% of this iron is labile, i.e., potentially available to phytoplankton. Due to their large biomass, frequent benthic feeding, and acidic digestion of particulate iron, krill might facilitate an input of new iron to Southern Ocean surface waters. Deep migrations and foraging at the seabed are significant parts of krill ecology, and the vertical fluxes involved in this behavior are important for the coupling of benthic and pelagic food webs and their elemental repositories.

Abundance and grazing impacts of krill, salps and copepods along the 140 degrees E meridian in the Southern Ocean during summer	ANTARCTIC SCIENCE												Abundance and grazing impacts of krill, salps and herbivorous copepods were investigated in Antarctic waters along the 140 degrees E meridian, south of Australia, during the summers of 2002 and 2003. North of the Southern Boundary of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (SB-ACC), macrozooplankton comprised species of Salpa thompsoni and large herbivorous copepods, while the area south of the SBACC was numerically dominated by Euphausia superba or E. crystallorophias. North of the SB-ACC, the estimate of grazing impact revealed that krill, salps and copepods, Calanoides acutus, Calanus propinquus, Rhincalanus gigas and Metridia gerlachei, are able to remove a maximum of 37% of the total phytoplankton standing stock in early to midsummer, but grazing is negligible in late summer. The high grazing impact is attributed to the relatively high zooplankton abundance and low phytoplankton abundance. South of the SB-ACC, overall daily grazing impact of the three zooplankton groups was low and did not exceed 6% of the total phytoplankton standing stock throughout the investigation period. Present results indicate that the contribution of krill, salps and copepods varies seasonally as well as regionally across the SB-ACC. It seems that the carbon transport from surface to deep water by macro- and mesozooplankton in summer in this area is relatively large north of the SB-ACC but small south of the SB-ACC.

Euphausiids constituted on average 96% by mass, while fish contributed 4% by mass. Amphipods were present in small amounts. Antarctic krill Euphausia superba was the predominant component throughout the sampling period. In contrast, Euphausia crystallorophias occurred rarely. Differences in the size of krill taken by Adelie penguins appear to reflect either local changes in the availability of certain age classes at various times in the breeding season, or differences in foraging areas, or are due to year-to-year differences in prey availability and abundance, possibly caused by variations in seasonal ice cover. Pleuragramma antarcticum constituted the bulk of the fish portion, particularly during the guard period.																	0722-4060					JUL	1995	15	6					415	418									WOS:A1995RJ23800004

Antarctic macrozooplankton of the southwest Atlantic sector and Bellingshausen Sea: Baseline historical distributions (Discovery Investigations, 1928-1935) related to temperature and food, with projections for subsequent ocean warming	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY												Since the Discovery Investigations of the 1920s and 1930s, seawater temperatures have increased in the Atlantic sector by similar to 1 degrees C; greater than the global mean rise. The aims of this paper were first to rescue the Discovery macrozooplankton data, second to provide quantitative "baseline" distribution maps, relating these to indices of temperature and food. Our third aim was to use the relationships we derived between abundance and temperature to project the potential affect of a 1 degrees C warming on the Discovery era distribution patterns. Based on the 1 m ringnet data retrieved from 615 stations (Nov-March), four taxa comprised >90% of the Antarctic macrozooplankton abundance: Rhincalanus gigas, Thysanoessa spp., Euphausia superba, and Chaetognaths. Most of the taxa, especially the more abundant ones, were warm water species penetrating into Antarctica and thus total macrozooplankton abundance decreased about 100-fold from 50 degrees S to 70 degrees S. While temperature correlated best with distribution at this large scale, food availability (proxied by a present-day satellite-based Chlorophyll a climatology) had a secondary effect, with the major euphausiids Euphausia superba and Thysanoessa spp. concentrated in high chl a areas. A modelled uniform 1 degrees C temperature rise produced a poleward shift for all taxa, but the Antarctic continent blocked this re-adjustment for the high latitude species, constricting their predicted range. More widespread polar/sub-polar species were predicted to increase their penetration into Antarctica by 4-12 degrees in latitude, whereas the poleward shift in potential range of sub-Antarctic taxa were limited by the steep temperature gradient across the Antarctic Polar Front (APF). However, within the Scotia Sea the relatively warm temperatures of the northern Antarctic Zone, abundant food due to iron fertilisation and intense eddy activity provide a "gateway" for northern species to penetrate south of the APF. Our model predictions, based on measured distributional ranges and observed temperature increases, provide a yardstick with which to compare modern day data compilations and assess the potential effects of future temperature increases.

The distribution, length-frequency and summer diet are described from 14 bottom trawl surveys undertaken in the summers between 1986 and 2006. Pseudochaenichthys georgianus (50-590 mm TL) were caught throughout the South Georgia shelf from depths of 76-370 m, but very few specimens (< 1%) were caught on the Shag Rocks shelf. Multiple cohorts were present during each survey and length-frequency analysis of these cohorts suggests that growth is fast during the first 3-4 years. Stomach contents analysis (2005 & 2006) indicated that P. georgianus is a pelagic or semi pelagic predator, with the summer diet dominated by Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba). Fish (channichthyids and notothenids) were also taken, but were a relatively minor part of the diet.				, Martin/ABE-6728-2020; Collins, Martin A/J-8560-2017; Reid, William/J-8528-2013	Reid, William/0000-0003-0190-0425												0954-1020	1365-2079				AUG	2008	20	4					343	353		10.1017/S0954102008000990							WOS:000257842500005

Macroalgae, gammarid amphipods and gastropods dominated the diet in the summer 1999/00 (IFA respectively 0.32, 0.32 and 0.21), at Ipanema, while macroalgae were dominant at Smok (IFA = 0.67), where krill and amphipods were secondary prey (IFA respectively 0.12 and 0.14) and gastropods were absent. Thus, the diet composition of N. coriiceps can possibly be used as an indicator of the presence of pelagic krill swarms.

Time budgets and at-sea behaviour of lactating female Antarctic fur seals Arctocephalus gazella at Bouvetoya	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												We present the first data on attendance patterns, at-sea movements and (living behaviour of Antarctic fur seals breeding at Bouvetoya (Bouvet Island), Southern Ocean, While other colonies have been extensively studied, this remote and second largest global population remains relatively unknown. Time depth recorders and satellite relay data loggers were deployed on breeding females during the 2000-2001 and 2001-2002 Summers. Attendance and foraging patterns were similar to those observed at colonies in the Scotia Sea region where Antarctic krill Euphausia superba is the predominant prey. Early to mid-lactation trips ranged within similar to 100 km of the island, usually towards the west; the dominant direction shifted later in the season and the range also increased markedly to a peak between early February and early March. Solar elevation influenced arrivals and departures from the island, with most departures occurring around sunset. Diurnal variations in diving behaviour were consistent with the vertical migration of krill. Diving frequency was high er at night and diving effort peaked around morning twilight, Afternoon deep diving was common, suggesting that females might target dense daytime krill aggregations between the photic zone and the thermocline. Trip durations increased throughout early to mid-lactation, peaking in late January to early March, before, again decreasing towards the end of lactation. Our results illustrate the substantial variability, both between individuals and within individuals over time, that is likely to reflect variations in prey distribution and in the growth requirements of pups. Such variations need to be taken into account when estimating habitat use and resource utilisation in marine top predators.

However, this approach is not appropriate for assessing temporal variability. The size of krill in the diet of Antarctic fur seals (Arctocephalus gazella) has been shown to provide a good representation of the temporal changes in the krill population structure from within their foraging area. At Cape Shirreff, South Shetland Islands, krill in nets had modal size classes of 46-48 mm and 52-54 mm in length and appeared to reflect the presence of larger krill offshore and smaller krill inshore; krill in the diet of fur seals contained both modes, indicating that the foraging area of fur seals integrated the spatial variability in the krill population. At Signy Island, South Orkney Islands, krill in nets and fur seal diets had a modal size class of 52 mm when sampled simultaneously; however, krill in the diet of seals showed a decline in size later in the season with an overall mode of 48 mm. At Bird Island, South Georgia, there was little overlap between net samples, with a modal size class of 30-40 mm, and fur seal diets, with distinct modes of 44 and 54 mm; and there was also much greater spatial variability in the size of krill in these net samples than in those from the other two locations. Extending the comparison of krill size in the diet of seals, to include spatially congruent net samples collected immediately prior to the CCAMLR 2000 Survey, showed almost complete overlap and indicated an even greater spatial variability in the krill population structure at South Georgia. Interactions between the oceanographic transport and enhanced growth rates of krill at South Georgia may combine to produce a higher degree of spatial variability in the krill population compared to other locations and this may limit the use of differences in krill length as an indicator of their provenance. This study underlines the importance of using data from multiple sources when considering large-scale krill population dynamics; information that is crucial to the effective management of the commercial exploitation of krill.

Length at maturity L(50) is defined as the length at which 50% of the krill stock attains sexual maturity. L(50) values of 34.65-35.91 mm for female krill are the best estimates for the peak spawning season. Males attain sexual maturity later at L(50) values of 43.35-43.71 mm, Length at maturity and length at first spawning are identical for krill. Comparisons with mean length-at-age data show that females mature in the third growth season (age class 2+), while males reach maturity in the fourth year (age class 3+). Both sexes show 'knife-edge maturity'.																	0954-1020					DEC	1994	6	4					479	482		10.1017/S0954102094000726							WOS:A1994QA66500007

Linking Antarctic krill larval supply and recruitment along the Antarctic Peninsula	INTEGRATIVE AND COMPARATIVE BIOLOGY												Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) larval production and overwinter survival drive recruitment variability, which in turn determines abundance trends. The Antarctic Peninsula has been described as a recruitment hot spot and as a potentially important source region for larval and juvenile krill dispersal. However, there has been no analysis to spatially resolve regional-scale krill population dynamics across life stages. We assessed spatiotemporal patterns in krill demography using two decades of austral summer data collected along the North and West Antarctic Peninsula since 1993. We identified persistent spatial segregation in the summer distribution of euphausiid larvae (E. superba plus other species), which were concentrated in oceanic waters along the continental slope, and E. superba recruits, which were concentrated in shelf and coastal waters. Mature females of E. superba were more abundant over the continental shelf than the slope or coast. Euphausiid larval abundance was relatively localized and weakly correlated between the North and West Antarctic Peninsula, while E. superba recruitment was generally synchronized throughout the entire region. Euphausiid larval abundance along the West Antarctic Peninsula slope explained E. superba recruitment in shelf and coastal waters the next year. Given the localized nature of krill productivity, it is critical to evaluate the connectivity between upstream and downstream areas of the Antarctic Peninsula and beyond. Krill fishery catch distributions and population projections in the context of a changing climate should account for ontogenetic habitat partitioning, regional population connectivity, and highly variable recruitment.

In all years the diet was mainly crustaceans, with a small proportion of myctophid fish and trace amounts of cephalopods. Antarctic krill Euphausia superba was the dominant prey item in three years and was replaced by calanoid copepods, especially Rhincalanus gigas and Calanoides acutus, in two years of low krill abundance. Differences in the prey species taken and observations of foraging behaviour suggest that in years of low krill availability Antarctic Prions forage closer inshore, taking copepods by filtering surface water through their palatal lamellae. By switching to feeding on copepods Antarctic Prions are apparently able to maintain a comparable level of reproductive success, unlike most other krill feeding species which suffer much reduced reproductive performance in years of reduced krill availability.																	0158-4197					JUN	1997	97		2				126	132		10.1071/MU97016							WOS:A1997XT91400004

Feeding habits of three seal species at the Danco Coast, Antarctica: a re-assessment	POLAR BIOLOGY												The analysis of prey overlap among Weddell, Antarctic fur and leopard seals was conducted using fecal samples collected at the Danco Coast, Antarctic Peninsula, in 1998 and 2000. The re-occurrence of prey species was moderate in samples collected in 1998, and low in 2000, and reflects resource partitioning among seal species. Prey species that mostly co-occurred in seals' diet were the Antarctic krill Euphausia superba, bivalves, and the myctophids Gymnoscopelus nicholsi and Electrona antarctica. A dietary similarity index of prey overlap has been calculated and demonstrates evident fluctuations in pairwise comparisons between the seal species.

Ocean warming threatens southern right whale population recovery	SCIENCE ADVANCES												Whales contribute to marine ecosystem functioning, and they may play a role in mitigating climate change and supporting the Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) population, a keystone prey species that sustains the entire Southern Ocean (SO) ecosystem. By analyzing a five-decade (1971-2017) data series of individual southern right whales (SRWs; Eubalaena australis) photo-identified at Peninsula Valdes, Argentina, we found a marked increase in whale mortality rates following El Nino events. By modeling how the population responds to changes in the frequency and intensity of El Nino events, we found that such events are likely to impede SRW population recovery and could even cause population decline. Such outcomes have the potential to disrupt food-web interactions in the SO, weakening that ecosystem's contribution to the mitigation of climate change at a global scale.

J	VORONINA, NM; MASLENNIKOV, VV				VORONINA, NM; MASLENNIKOV, VV			PLANKTON AS AN INDICATOR OF WATER TRANSPORT IN THE ANTARCTIC	OKEANOLOGIYA												Studies were made of net plankton in the 0 - 1500 m layer along the section from the Adelaide Island to the Pennella Coast and in the region northeastwards of the Balleni Isles. The bulk of organisms was composed of a complex of typical Antarctic copepods Calanoides acutus, Calanus propinquus and Rhincalanus gigas, however, separate water modifications differed in their specific features. The lowlatitude Antarctic Circumpolar Current area was characterized by the occurrence mainly in deep layers of species with the polar frontal and sub-antarctic ranges (Euphausia triacantha, C. simillimus, Eucalanus longiceps, E. hyalinus). The high-latitude Coastal Antarctic current was characterized by abundance of Euphausia superba larvae. The mixed water of the Ross gyre did not contain the northern inhabitants at all and had only scarce E. superba larvae.																	0030-1574					SEP-OCT	1993	33	5					717	720									WOS:A1993MJ08900012

The slow settling fine particles showed a marked inter-annual variability in biochemical composition with an increase in lipid content as % organic carbon. Comparison of the fatty acid spectra of different size categories of organic particles indicated that fine particles are dominated by saturated, monoenoic and branched acids, while larger material (50-100 mu m, 200-500 mu m net collected fractions) displayed a signature dominated by polyunsaturated acids. Zooplankton taxa displayed different strategies of lipid accumulation. Lipid content was highest in Thysanoessa macrura females and copepodite stages of Calanus propinquus. Relatively low levels were recorded for juveniles and male stages of euphausiids. Reserve lipids varied with species: C. propinquus showed equal content of triglycerides and wax esters, T. macrura showed a dominance of wax esters and Euphausia superba and Themisto gaudichaudii accumulated only triglycerides. Computed as carbon equivalent and integrated over 200 m, lipids in slow settling particles represented 22.6% of annual primary production. Similar computation with mesozooplankton and E. superba data on biomass and population structure from several summer cruises indicated values of carbon accumulation as Lipid reserves and egg production of 4.2 and 0.1% of annual primary production for copepods and 4.4 and 3.8% for E. superba. When all trophic levels are considered, the overall mean exceeded 30% of annual primary production.																	0924-7963					NOV	1998	17	1-4					391	410		10.1016/S0924-7963(98)00051-7							WOS:000077463500027

The trophodynamics of Southern Ocean Electrona (Myctophidae) in the Scotia Sea	POLAR BIOLOGY												The Scotia Sea is one of the most productive regions of the Southern Ocean, but its surface waters are experiencing a rapid increase in temperature, which may be changing the behaviour and distribution of many myctophids and their prey species. Electrona antarctica and Electrona carlsbergi are two of the most abundant myctophids in the region, but their ecology is poorly understood and their response to ongoing environmental change is difficult to determine. This study investigated spatial and temporal patterns in their abundance, population structure and diets using mid-water trawl nets deployed across the Scotia Sea during spring, summer and autumn. E. antarctica was the most numerically abundant species (0.09-0.21 ind. 1,000 m(-3)), with greatest concentrations occurring in the sea-ice sectors. E. carlsbergi occurred in more northern regions, comprising densities of 0.02-0.11 ind. 1,000 m(-3). There was evidence of seasonal variation in depth distribution, size-related sexual dimorphism and size-specific vertical stratification for both species. Latitudinal trends in sex ratio and female body size were apparent for E. antarctica. Its diet varied between regions, seasons and size classes, but overall, Euphausia superba, Metridia spp. and Themisto gaudichaudii were the dominant prey items. E. carlsbergi appeared not to recruit in the Scotia Sea. Its diet was dominated by copepods, particularly Rhincalanus gigas and Metridia spp., but regional, seasonal and ontogenetic variations were evident. This study contributes to our understanding of how mid-water food webs are structured in the Southern Ocean and their sensitivity to ongoing environmental change.

The Southern Ocean is a net sink for many POPs, with a key contribution of the settling fluxes of POPs bound to organic matter (biological pump). However, little is known about POP transfer through the food web in the Southern Ocean and Antarctic waters, where krill is an important ecological node. In this study, we assessed the occurrence of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and furans (PCDD/Fs), polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) from the Bellingshausen, South Scotia and Weddell Seas around the Antarctic Peninsula. The concentrations of PCDD/Fs, PBDEs and PCBs in krill showed a large variability and the average were higher (generally within a factor 3) than those previously reported for eastern Antarctica. This result highlights regional differences related to atmospheric transport and deposition, and also probable regional sources due to human activities. Bioaccumulation and biomagnification factors for PCBs in krill were estimated using previously reported phytoplankton and seawater concentrations for this region. These suggested a near water-krill equilibrium for PCBs, which was not observed for water-phytoplankton partitioning. The estimated removal settling fluxes of PCBs due to the biological pump were several orders ofmagnitude higher than the estimated fluxes of PCBs transferred from phytoplankton to krill.

J	ROBY, DD				ROBY, DD			DIET AND POSTNATAL ENERGETICS IN CONVERGENT TAXA OF PLANKTON-FEEDING SEABIRDS	AUK												To evaluate the influence of diet composition on seabird postnatal development, I examined the relationships between feeding rate, energy intake, energy partitioning, and chick growth in three species of high latitude, plankton-feeding seabirds: Least Auklet (Aethia pusilla), South Georgia Diving Petrel (Pelecanoides georgicus), and Common Diving Petrel (P. urinatrix). Average dietary lipid content varied from 22 to 46% of dry mass among the three species. Least Auklet chicks were fed meals rich in wax esters; on average 63% of total energy intake was in the form of wax. Interspecific comparisons of chick dietary composition and energy budgets indicated that calanoid copepods, a wax ester-rich food, was a balanced source of protein and lipids. However, the lipid content of Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) was insufficient to meet maintenance energy requirements of Common Diving Petrels. Lipid-rich diets were associated with shorter brooding periods, higher rates of nestling fat deposition, and larger lipid reserves at fledging. Accumulation rates of lipid-free dry matter were similar in the three species despite differences in energy intake related to diet. The energy cost of growth was a relatively minor component of nestling energy budgets; most assimilated energy was allocated toward maintenance and fat deposition. Selection apparently favors high latitude seabirds that meet the high energy requirements of their chicks by providing a lipid-rich diet. Differences in diet composition explained much of the variation in postnatal development among the three species, but there was no evidence that energy limited growth per se.

Application of liposome and stable isotope tracer techniques to study polyunsaturated fatty acid biosynthesis in marine zooplankton	JOURNAL OF PLANKTON RESEARCH												We investigated the ability of four species of marine zooplanklon to synthesize polyunsaturated fato acids (PUFAs) during pulse-chase tracer experiments. Liposomes containing a deuterium labelled precursor fatty acid, D-5-183n-3, were fed to female Calanus finmarchicus, Calanoides acutus, Drepanopus forcipatus and caylptopus larvae of Euphausia superba during ship-board experiments. Although all species of zooplankton readily ingested the liposomes and incorporated the D-5-18:3n-3 tracer into their somatic lipid pool, only negligible products of elongation and desaturation; D-5-18:4n.-3, D-5-20:5n-3 and D-5-22:6n(-3) were detected after 96 h incubations. We conclude that the four species of marine zooplankton examined here are unable to synthesize PUPA at ecologically significant rates and certainly not in amounts sufficient to support growth and reproductive processes.

A Bayesian hierarchical model of Antarctic fur seal foraging and pup growth related to sea ice and prey abundance	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS												We created a Bayesian hierarchical model (BHM) to investigate ecosystem relationships between the physical ecosystem (sea ice extent), a prey measure (krill density), predator behaviors (diving and foraging effort of female Antarctic fur seals, Arctocephalus gazella, with pups) and predator characteristics (mass of maternal fur seals and pups). We collected data on Antarctic fur seals from 1987/1988 to 1994/1995 at Seal Island, Antarctica. The BHM allowed us to link together predators and prey into a model that uses all the data efficiently and accounts for major sources of uncertainty. Based on the literature, we made hypotheses about the relationships in the model, which we compared with the model outcome after fitting the BHM. For each BHM parameter, we calculated the mean of the posterior density and the 95% credible interval. Our model confirmed others' findings that increased sea ice was related to increased krill density. Higher krill density led to reduced dive intensity of maternal fur seals, as measured by dive depth and duration, and to less time spent foraging by maternal fur seals. Heavier maternal fur seals and lower maternal foraging effort resulted in heavier pups at 22 d. No relationship was found between krill density and maternal mass, or between maternal mass and foraging effort on pup growth rates between 22 and 85 days of age. Maternal mass may have reflected environmental conditions prior to the pup provisioning season, rather than summer prey densities. Maternal mass and foraging effort were not related to pup growth rates between 22 and 85 d, possibly indicating that food was not limiting, food sources other than krill were being used, or differences occurred before pups. reached age 22 d.
