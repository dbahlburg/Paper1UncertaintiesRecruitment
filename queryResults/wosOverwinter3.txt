J	Yang, EJ; Lee, Y; Lee, S				Yang, Eun Jin; Lee, Youngju; Lee, SangHoon			Trophic interactions of micro- and mesozooplankton in the Amundsen Sea polynya and adjacent sea ice zone during austral late summer	PROGRESS IN OCEANOGRAPHY												To elucidate the trophic link between micro- and mesozooplankton in the Amundsen Sea polynya (ASP) and adjacent sea ice zone, we estimated the impact of microzooplankton grazing on major phytoplankton groups, as well as the diet composition, ingestion rate, and prey selectivity of two copepods and Euphausia crystallorophias larvae on microbial communities during the late summer. Phaeocystis antarctica, which was ingested by micro-and mesozooplankton, comprised most phytoplankton biomass. Herbivorous microzooplankton consumed at least half of the phytoplankton production, but the microzooplankton grazing may not contribute strongly to the decline of the phytoplankton bloom. Three mesozooplankton species (Calanoides acutus, Metridia gerlachei, and E. crystallorophias larvae) preferentially grazed on ciliates and heterotrophic dinoflagellates (HDF) with sizes from 20 to > 100 mu m over phytoplankton. Although microzooplankton comprised only an average of 41.7 +/- 3.2% of the total carbon available in the natural prey pool, they accounted for an average of 75.4 +/- 2.9% of total carbon ingested by copepods and krill larvae. Heterotrophic food sources made up a substantial proportion of mesozooplankton diets, with strong positive selection for microzooplankton at most locations regardless of phytoplankton size and type. In particular, HDF comprised the major dietary component of mesozooplankton in the study area. The presence of mesozooplankton reduced the grazing pressure on P. antarctica and diatoms through predation on herbivorous microzooplankton. Approximately half of the primary production capacity may have indirectly reached mesozooplankton through microzooplankton consumption. Thus, strongly selective feeding behavior and higher grazing pressure on microzooplankton indicated the importance of microheterotrophic pathways through strong trophic coupling between mesozooplankton and the microbial food web during the decline of phytoplankton bloom. In the highly productive ASP system, food web structure can be classified as multivorous, whereby herbivorous and omnivorous modes both play significant roles in carbon export, enhancing the efficiency of the pelagic food web.																	0079-6611					MAY-JUN	2019	174				SI		117	130		10.1016/j.pocean.2018.12.003							WOS:000471364200012

At Becher-vaise Island, a nesting site in an East Antarctic population, Adelie penguin diving behaviour remains undocumented. This represents a key area of uncertainty in efforts to understand and predict foraging success at this colony. We compiled a multi-year telemetry dataset from time-depth recorders deployed from 1992 to 2004 on 64 birds at Bechervaise Island. We examined diving activity at multiple scales, ranging from foraging trips (n = 125) to dive bouts (n = 3461) to individual dives (n = 84 521), and then characterised the stage- and sex-specific variation in diving behaviour of chick-rearing Adelie penguins using linear mixed effect models. Total foraging trip effort (trip duration, number of dives, vertical distance travelled and number of wiggles [a proxy for prey ingestion]) substantially increased as the chick-rearing period progressed (guard through creche), consistent with increasing chick provisioning and self-maintenance requirements over time. Foraging activity was predominantly structured in periods of sustained diving bouts, indicating sustained foraging effort over the course of the foraging trip. Diving behaviour (dive-level depth, duration, bottom time and attempts of catch per unit effort) varied in relation to sex and chick-rearing stage. Dives were performed more frequently during high and low levels of solar light, which is likely linked to visual predation strategies or prey activity. Our findings advance our understanding of this population's foraging behaviour, which is ultimately required to underpin the conservation and management of this breeding colony.

J	Prezelin, BB; Hofmann, EE; Moline, M; Klinck, JM				Prezelin, BB; Hofmann, EE; Moline, M; Klinck, JM			Physical forcing of phytoplankton community structure and primary production in continental shelf waters of the Western Antarctic Peninsula	JOURNAL OF MARINE RESEARCH												Analyses of a multidisciplinary data set, collected in continental shelf waters of the Western Antarctic Peninsula (WAP) during austral summer of January 1993, identified a previously unrecognized forcing mechanism that sets up a physical and chemical structure that supports and assures site-specific diatom-dominated communities and enhanced biological production (Prezelin et al., 2000). This forcing is active when the southern boundary of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) flows along the shelf edge, thereby facilitating onshelf bottom intrusions of nutrient-rich Upper Circumpolar Deep Water (UCDW), which then is upwelled or mixed into the upper water column. At times or locations where UCDW is not introduced to the upper water column, diatoms no longer dominate phytoplankton assemblages over the mid- to outer WAP continental shelf. This analysis extends the area and seasons studied through similar analyses of multidisciplinary data sets collected on four additional cruises to the WAP that cover all seasons. Results show that onshelf intrusions of UCDW: (1) occur in other regions of the WAP continental shelf; (2) are episodic; (3) are forced by nonseasonal physical processes; and (4) produce areas of diatom-dominated phytoplankton assemblages and enhanced primary production. At times, multiple intrusions are observed on the WAP continental shelf, and each event may be in a different stage. Further, the occurrence of an intrusion event in one area does not necessarily imply that similar events are ongoing in other areas along the WAP shelf. The UCDW bottom intrusions originate along the outer shelf but they can extend into the inner shelf region because the deep troughs that transect the WAP shelf provide connections between the inner and outer shelf. The boundary between the intruded water and the shelf water is variable in location because of the episodic nature of the onshelf intrusions, and is moved farther inshore as an event occurs. These observations show clearly that the phytoplankton community structure on the WAP shelf is determined by physical forcing and that primary production is likely to be considerably greater than previously believed. Moreover, variability in this physical forcing, such as may occur via climate change, can potentially affect the overall biological production of the WAP continental shelf system.

Habitat use of hourglass dolphins near the South Shetland Islands, Antarctica	POLAR BIOLOGY												The hourglass dolphin Lagenorhynchus cruciger is the only regularly occurring small delphinid found south of the Antarctic Polar Front, yet little is known about its ecology and habitat use. This study uses 8 years (14 cruises) of standardized shipboard surveys during January-March (2003-2011) in southern Drake Passage near the South Shetland Islands to summarize the spatial distribution of hourglass dolphin sightings and quantify habitat use. Sighting data are linked to bathymetry (depth, slope) and distance to the average location of oceanographic features. A generalized linear model is used to examine the relationships between sightings and habitat features. Hourglass dolphins were sighted on 50% of surveys (n = 29); sightings were concentrated in February. Group size tended to be 2-6 individuals; there were only 2 sightings of larger groups, of 15 and 25 individuals. Sightings were distributed entirely within the deep pelagic waters north of the South Shetland Islands in southern Drake Passage and were closely associated with the southern boundary of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current. Information on occurrence and distribution reported in this study may be useful for refining habitat associations for hourglass dolphins at regional scales in the Southern Ocean.																	0722-4060					MAY	2012	35	5					801	806		10.1007/s00300-011-1133-8							WOS:000302480600015

Observations and models to support the first Marine Ecosystem Assessment for the Southern Ocean (MEASO)	JOURNAL OF MARINE SYSTEMS												Assessments of the status and trends of habitats, species and ecosystems are needed for effective ecosystem-based management in marine ecosystems. Knowledge on imminent ecosystem changes (climate change impacts) set in train by existing climate forcings are needed for adapting management practices to achieve conservation and sustainabililty targets into the future. Here, we describe a process for enabling a marine ecosystem assessment (MEA) by the broader scientific community to support managers in this way, using a MEA for the Southern Ocean (MEASO) as an example. We develop a framework and undertake an audit to support a MEASO, involving three parts. First, we review available syntheses and assessments of the Southern Ocean ecosystem and its parts, paying special attention to building on the SCAR Antarctic Climate Change and Environment report and the SCAR Biogeographic Atlas of the Southern Ocean. Second, we audit available field observations of habitats and densities and/or abundances of taxa, using the literature as well as a survey of scientists as to their current and recent activities. Third, we audit available system models that can form a nested ensemble for making, with available data, circumpolar assessments of habitats, species and food webs. We conclude that there is sufficient data and models to undertake, at least, a circumpolar assessment of the krill-based system. The auditing framework provides the basis for the first MEASO but also provides a repository (www.SOKI.aq/display/MEASO) for easily amending the audit for future MEASOs. We note that an important outcome of the first MEASO will not only be the assessment but also to advise on priorities in observations and models for improving subsequent MEASOs.

SealNet: A fully-automated pack-ice seal detection pipeline for sub-meter satellite imagery	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Antarctic pack-ice seals, a group of four species of true seals (Phocidae), play a pivotal role in the Southern Ocean foodweb as wide-ranging predators of Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba). Due to their circumpolar distribution and the remoteness and vastness of their habitat, little is known about their population sizes. Estimating pack-ice seal population sizes and trends is key to understanding how the Southern Ocean ecosystem will react to threats such as climate change driven sea ice loss and krill fishing. We present a functional pack-ice seal detection pipeline using Worldview-3 imagery and a Convolutional Neural Network that counts and locates seal centroids. We propose a new CNN architecture that detects objects by combining semantic segmentation heatmaps with binary classification and counting by regression. Our pipeline locates over 30% of seals, when compared to consensus counts from human experts, and reduces the time required for seal detection by 95% (assuming just a single GPU). While larger training sets and continued algorithm development will no doubt improve classification accuracy, our pipeline, which can be easily adapted for other large-bodied animals visible in sub-meter satellite imagery, demonstrates the potential for machine learning to vastly expand our capacity for regular pack-ice seal surveys and, in doing so, will contribute to ongoing international efforts to monitor pack-ice seals.

Habitat-based density models of pack-ice seal distribution in the southern Weddell Sea, Antarctica	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												Climate variability and changes in sea ice dynamics have caused several ice-obligate or krill-dependent populations of marine predators to decline, eliciting concern about their demographic persistence and the indirect ecological consequences that predator depletions may have on marine ecosystems. Pack-ice seals are dominant ice-obligate predators in the Antarctic marine ecosystem, but there is considerable uncertainty about their abundance and population trends. We modelled the density and distribution of pack-ice seals as a function of environmental covariates in the southern Weddell Sea, Antarctica. Our density surface modelling approach used data from aerial surveys of pack-ice seals collected in the 2013/14 austral summer. Crabeater seals Lobodon carcinophaga, the most numerous pack-ice seal we observed, occurred at the highest densities in areas with extensive sea ice near the continental shelf break, but were almost absent in areas of similar sea ice concentration in the southern extent of the Weddell Sea. The highest densities of Weddell seals Leptonychotes weddelli, which were less abundant than crabeater seals within the pack-ice habitat, were predicted to occur over the continental shelf, near the shelf break. The distribution of both seal species broadly corresponded with the distribution and relative abundance of their main prey (Antarctic krill Euphausia superba and Antarctic silverfish Pleuragramma antarctica) obtained from concurrent ecosystem surveys. Ross seals Ommatophoca rossii and leopard seals Hydrurga leptonyx were not detected at all and are apparently rare within the southern Weddell Sea. These results can contribute to biodiversity assessments in the context of marine protected area planning in this region of the Southern Ocean.

An individual-based model of the krill Euphausia pacifica in the California Current	PROGRESS IN OCEANOGRAPHY												Euphausia pacifica is an abundant and important prey resource for numerous predators of the California Current and elsewhere in the North Pacific. We developed an individual-based model (IBM) for E. pacifica to study its bioenergetics (growth, stage development, reproduction, and mortality) under constant/ideal conditions as well as under varying ocean conditions and food resources. To model E. pacifica under varying conditions, we coupled the IBM to an oceanographic-ecosystem model over the period 2000-2008 (9 years). Model results under constant/ideal food conditions compare favorably with experimental studies conducted under food unlimited conditions. Under more realistic variable oceanographic conditions, mean growth rates over the continental shelf were positive only when individuals migrated diurnally to the depth of maximum phytoplankton layer during nighttime feeding. Our model only used phytoplankton as prey and coastal growth rates were lower than expected (0.01 mm d(-1)), suggesting that a diverse prey base (zooplankton, protists, marine snow) may be required to facilitate growth and survival of modeled E. pacifica in the coastal environment. This coupled IBM-ROMS modeling framework and its parameters provides a tool for understanding the biology and ecology of E. pacifica and could be developed to further the understanding of climatic effects on this key prey species and enhance an ecosystem approach to fisheries and wildlife management in this region.

J	Hagen, W; Kattner, G				Hagen, W; Kattner, G			Lipid metabolism of the Antarctic euphausiid Thysanoessa macrura and its ecological implications	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												The lipid biochemistry of one of the dominant Antarctic euphausiids, Thysanoessa macrura, was investigated in the Weddell Sea. Ontogenetic stages from furciliae to adults were collected during all seasons. Total lipid contents of these stages ranged from 5.5% to 60.5% of dry mass, with minimum levels in late winter/early spring (October/ November) and maximum levels in autumn (April/May). Accordingly, wax esters, the primary storage lipid in T. macrura, also varied seasonally and reached a mean value of 66.6% of total lipid in autumn. Although lipid reserves are used partly for overwintering, the adults invest considerable amounts of these stores in reproductive processes such as gonad maturation, egg production, and mating in late winter prior to the vernal phytoplankton bloom. Total lipids were dominated by the fatty acids 16:0, 20:5(n-3), and 22:6(n-3), the principal components of the phospholipids. Other important fatty acids were 14:0 and 18:1(n-9), which together with 16:0 prevailed in the wax esters. The alcohol moieties of the wax esters consisted of >90% of the isomers 18:1(n-9) and 18:1(n-7) and of 20:1(n-9). The dominance of 18:1 alcohols in T. macrura is unique among marine plankton. All fatty acids and alcohols exhibited linear relationships with increasing total lipid mass and with total lipid content, irrespective of the developmental stage, sex, region, or season. The fatty acids 16:0, 14:0, and 20:5(n-3) and the two 18:1 fatty alcohol isomers had the highest accumulation rates, which explains their seasonal dominance in the lipid-rich specimens. T. macrura has developed quantitative and qualitative energetic adaptations to cope with the pronounced seasonal variability in feeding conditions and reproductive requirements.

J	Pakhomov, EA; Perissinotto, R; McQuaid, CD				Pakhomov, EA; Perissinotto, R; McQuaid, CD			Prey composition and daily rations of myctophid fishes in the Southern Ocean	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												The feeding ecology of myctophids was studied using data collected during 5 South African scientific cruises to the Southern Ocean from 1985 to 1995. A total of 362 specimens, comprising 36 species, were analyzed for gut contents. Myctophid biomass levels, estimated from Bongo net tows, are among the lowest yet recorded for the Southern Ocean. Peak biomass levels were associated with the main frontal zones and with a permanent polynya region in the Lazarev Sea. Results show that all myctophid species are opportunistic mesozooplankton feeders exhibiting a high degree of overlap in their food spectrum and consuming primarily the most abundant species of copepods, euphausiids, hyperiids and pteropods. Daily rations were estimated using 3 different approaches and ranged from 0.2 to 4.4% of dry body weights. Generally, the daily food intake was equivalent to 0.5 (lower mean) to 2.9 (upper mean) of dry body weight for Antarctic and subantarctic species, and between 1.2 and 3.8% for temperate and subtropical species. Antarctic krill, Euphausia superba, was usually poorly represented in the stomachs of all but 1 myctophid species. The results of this study therefore do not support the hypothesis that krill plays a major role in the feeding ecology and budget of myctophids.

Food web dynamics in the Scotia Sea in summer: A stable isotope study	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY												The pelagic food web of the Scotia Sea was studied by analysing natural abundances of nitrogen and carbon stable isotopes of primary producers and pelagic consumers, sampled from the seasonal ice edge in the south to the Antarctic Polar Front in the north. The analysis covered, within a single mid-summer period, particulate organic matter (POM) and 38 taxa, ranging from suspension feeding copepods and salps to omnivorous euphausiids, pelagic fish and higher, land-based predators including fur seals, penguins and flying birds. Spatial variation in delta N-15 of POM correlated well with nutrient availability and primary productivity. Latitudinal differences in delta C-13 of POM were closely linked to variations in temperature, nutrients and productivity depending on the frontal region sampled. This translated to equivalent (although smaller) regional delta C-13 differences among higher trophic levels. The trophic positions of species based on isotope values broadly agreed with previously published dietary data with three important exceptions. First, the carnivorous amphipod Themisto gaudichaudii had anomalously low delta N-15 values. Second, Euphausia superba had delta N-15 values that were also surprisingly low, considering the abundant literature suggesting its omnivory. Third, the copepod Rhincalanus gigas, considered a suspension feeder, had unexpectedly high delta N-15 values rather more in keeping with omnivorous feeding. The consumer delta N-15 values ranged from 1.2 parts per thousand (min.) measured in Salpa thompsoni (designated here as trophic level (TL) 2 across all regions) to 15.2 parts per thousand (max.) measured in white-chinned petrels (Procellaria aequinoctialis, calculated as TL5 relative to the TL2 of salps). Excluding seabirds, the resulting food chain length of 3.7 TL (above POM at TL1) was lower than in most other Southern Ocean and temperate marine pelagic ecosystems. The majority (60%) of vertebrate predators occupied only 1-1.5 trophic levels above the herbivorous suspension feeders such as krill. This indicates the existence of the classic short food chain of POM-suspension feeder-vertebrate predator. However the presence of trophic levels 4 and above indicates the existence of alternative trophic pathways, for example involving myctophid fish or carrion, and that some wide-ranging predators which breed at South Georgia also feed outside the region. This conclusion is supported first by the continuum of delta N-15 values between krill, suspension feeding copepods and myctophid fish, and secondly by higher trophic levels in several of the myctophid species in the low-krill region of the northern Scotia Sea, suggesting latitudinal differences in food web structure and food chain length.

The amount and composition of the vertical particle flux under sea ice were determined during a period of 30 days in order to investigate the influence of biological processes in sea ice and on its underside on the flux. The total mass flux was dominated by diatoms, faecal material, and aggregates, and ranged from 95.28 to 197.67 mg m(-2) d(-1) at 10m, depth and from 51.54 to 55.34 mg m(-2) d(-1) at 70m depth. A strong increase with time of the flux of chlorophyll equivalents, biogenic silica, and faecal material was recorded during the observation period, coincident with the increase in the concentration of chlorophyll a in the bottom ice layer above the trap array. The latter suggests a concomitant increase in the amount of food available for grazers, such as krill, in the bottom ice layer and on the underside of the ice floe, resulting in an increased downward transport of ice-algal material into the water column. The sinking faecal material was dominated by krill faecal strings and contained large amounts of diatom frustule debris, as well as intact diatom frustules, mainly of the species Fragilariopsis curta and E cylindrus. Single pronounced flux events of Phaeocystis antarctica and aggregates were also observed early in the study period. Low POC/PON and biogenic silica/POC ratios of the sinking particulate matter suggest that the material collected in the traps was relatively fresh. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Group 1 was defined as the 'Subantarctic community' because it appeared exclusively north of the Polar Front, and indicator species of the group included Eucalanus longiceps and Limacina retroversa, which are typical subantarctic species. Groups 2a and 2b occurred in the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC), and are thus defined as the 'ACC communities'. All indicator species for Group 2b, including large copepods, Calanoides acutus, Calanus propinquus and Metridia gerlachei, were also common indicators for Group 2a. In Group 2a, smaller copepods (small calanoids, cyclopoids and poecilostomatoids) and non-copepod herbivores were also indicators. Total abundance was markedly high in Group 2a, and copepods numerically dominated all 3 groups (>70% in Group 1, >80 % in 2a, >90 % in 2b). The longitudinal distribution pattern of Groups 2a and 2b varied between years, although they occurred along the same latitude. Multiple-regression analysis on environmental variables and distribution of the groups demonstrated that Group 2a tended to occur in relatively warm water masses with high chlorophyll a and low silicate concentrations. While Group 2b occurred in colder areas with low chlorophyll a concentrations, the results of this study suggest that the occasional intrusion of northern water further south caused by meandering of the ACC might have been responsible for the observed distribution patterns of the zooplankton community.																	0171-8630						2001	216						95	108		10.3354/meps216095							WOS:000170395500008

Using the Ocean Health Index to Identify Opportunities and Challenges to Improving Southern Ocean Ecosystem Health	FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE												The Antarctic coast and seas are considered some of the most pristine marine systems on Earth. Their comprehensive assessment is critical because meeting ambitious conservation objectives while maintaining sustainable human uses will be increasingly challenging with growing climate change impacts, recovery from past overharvesting, and potential revision of activities permitted with future revisions of the existing governance structure. We used the Ocean Health Index (OHI) to deliver an integrated assessment of the Antarctic marine ecosystems' evolving ecological and social dimensions. The OHI provides a framework to evaluate sustainable delivery of benefits people want from healthy oceans by measuring progress toward 10 widely-held societal goals. These goals include, conservation objectives, as well as other objectives, so as to identify tradeoffs across multiple priorities. We adapted the Index to the unique aspects and data availability of Antarctica. OHI scores were calculated for each sub-region defined by the Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR) as well as the region overall. OHI scores for conservation related goals (biodiversity, clean water) were generally high, though with some stressor impacts (i.e., climate-driven decline of sea-ice, and pathogen pollution). However, a sensitivity test on the sea-ice habitat indicator showed biodiversity scores might be much lower in the vicinity of the Antarctic Peninsula. Preservation of lasting special places, captured in the sense of place sub-goal, scored relatively low due to limited extent of Marine Protected Areas in the Southern Ocean. In several cases, scores are low due to under-utilization of resources, rather than environmentally unsustainable practices (e.g., food provision, natural products, tourism, and recreation). However, increased human activities would intensify the risk of pollution, pathogen contamination, and disturbance to wildlife, particularly if compounded with future climate change impacts. Therefore, scores may reflect the need to select more conservative targets for human use, articulated in international treaties, taking future risks into account. Our results highlight the need for more research on both natural and social science aspects of the Antarctic system, as well as the need to evaluate targets under different scenarios, so as to provide robust science-based advice for future decision-making in the region.

Trans-Atlantic variability in ecology of the pelagic tunicate Salpa thompsoni near the Antarctic Polar Front	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY												The distribution, density, demography and feeding dynamics of the pelagic tunicate Salpa thompsoni were investigated during the trans-Atlantic ANTARKTIS XXVIII/3 expedition to the Southern Ocean, on board RV Polarstern, between January and March 2012. Net samples were collected using an RMT-8 at four major sampling regions in the proximity of the Antarctic Polar Front (APF): along a 10 E transect, Salpastan, 12 W eulerian study, and the South Georgia Basin. Salps, mostly S. thompsoni, were found at all but one station and with few exceptions contributed < < 40% to total zooplankton in terms of both abundance and biomass. Salp abundance and biomass was lowest (6.2 ind.1000 m(-3) and 0.8 mgDW m(-3)) north of the APF along the 10 E transect and highest (3150 ind.1000 m(-3) and 20.5 mgDW m(-3)) at the Salpastan station south of the APF. Size distributions of S. thompsoni aggregates and solitaries, and their developmental dynamics, were similar in all locations except the Salpastan region. In aggregates, the overall salp size distributions were strongly right-tailed with the mass of the distribution always concentrated in the left where small aggregates (6-10 mm) dominated. During the eulerian study at 12 W, several cohorts of aggregates and solitaries were traceable allowing assessment of the daily growth rates of S. thompsoni. Estimated in situ growth rates of aggregates and solitaries were 0.53 +/- 0.18 and 2.83 +/- 0.42 mm day(-1), respectively, and the complete S. thompsoni life cycle duration (sexual+asexual) during austral summer at the APF region may have been as short as 2-3 months. The rapid growth rates of S. thompsoni found in this study urgently require further research to re-evaluate salp life cycle in the Southern Ocean.																	0967-0645	1879-0100				APR	2017	138						126	140		10.1016/j.dsr2.2017.03.001							WOS:000401211100011

Long-term inter- and intraspecific dietary variation in sibling seabird species	MARINE BIOLOGY												Northern Macronectes halli and southern giant petrels M. giganteus are opportunistic predators and the dominant avian scavengers in sub-Antarctic and Antarctic ecosystems. At South Georgia, there are globally important breeding populations of both species; however, no detailed diet study has been carried out at this site for>35 years. Here, we analysed stomach contents of northern (n=81) and southern giant petrel (n=73) chicks at Bird Island, South Georgia (2014/15-2016/17). Specifically, we investigated: (1) interspecific and sexual dietary segregation; (2) diet changes within and among recent years; and (3) long-term diet changes since 1979/80-1980/81. Overall diet composition was similar between species, with penguins comprising approximately half the diet by mass. In both species (but more pronounced in southern giant petrels), prey delivered by female parents included higher proportions (by mass) of penguins and Antarctic krill Euphausia superba, and by male parents included more Antarctic fur seal Arctocephalus gazella carrion and seabirds other than penguins. Consumption of penguins increased, and of seal carrion declined, as chick-rearing progressed, mirroring the decreasing availability of the latter after the peak pupping period in December at South Georgia. Comparisons with data from 1979/80-1980/81 suggest some changes in giant petrel diets; however, these differences were no greater than the typical annual variation, and there were no clear links between diet and breeding allochrony or the differing population trends (more rapid increase in northern than southern giant petrels). The high diet diversity and ability of giant petrels to exploit both carrion and marine prey facilitates coexistence with other sympatric Procellariiformes and explains their favourable population status.

Multiple-stage decisions in a marine central-place forager	ROYAL SOCIETY OPEN SCIENCE												Air-breathing marine animals face a complex set of physical challenges associated with diving that affect the decisions of how to optimize feeding. Baleen whales (Mysticeti) have evolved bulk-filter feeding mechanisms to efficiently feed on dense prey patches. Baleen whales are central place foragers where oxygen at the surface represents the central place and depth acts as the distance to prey. Although hypothesized that baleen whales will target the densest prey patches anywhere in the water column, how depth and density interact to influence foraging behaviour is poorly understood. We used multi-sensor archival tags and active acoustics to quantify Antarctic humpback whale foraging behaviour relative to prey. Our analyses reveal multi-stage foraging decisions driven by both krill depth and density. During daylight hours when whales did not feed, krill were found in deep high-density patches. As krill migrated vertically into larger and less dense patches near the surface, whales began to forage. During foraging bouts, we found that feeding rates (number of feeding lunges per hour) were greatest when prey was shallowest, and feeding rates decreased with increasing dive depth. This strategy is consistent with previous models of how air-breathing diving animals optimize foraging efficiency. Thus, humpback whales forage mainly when prey is more broadly distributed and shallower, presumably to minimize diving and searching costs and to increase feeding rates overall and thus foraging efficiency. Using direct measurements of feeding behaviour from animal-borne tags and prey availability from echosounders, our study demonstrates a multi-stage foraging process in a central place forager that we suggest acts to optimize overall efficiency by maximizing net energy gain over time. These data reveal a previously unrecognized level of complexity in predator-prey interactions and underscores the need to simultaneously measure prey distribution in marine central place forager studies.

J	Watanabe, YY; Takahashi, A				Watanabe, Yuuki Y.; Takahashi, Akinori			Linking animal-borne video to accelerometers reveals prey capture variability	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA												Understanding foraging is important in ecology, as it determines the energy gains and, ultimately, the fitness of animals. However, monitoring prey captures of individual animals is difficult. Direct observations using animal-borne videos have short recording periods, and indirect signals (e. g., stomach temperature) are never validated in the field. We took an integrated approach to monitor prey captures by a predator by deploying a video camera (lasting for 85 min) and two accelerometers (on the head and back, lasting for 50 h) on free-swimming Adelie penguins. The movies showed that penguins moved the heads rapidly to capture krill in midwater and fish (Pagothenia borchgrevinki) underneath the sea ice. Captures were remarkably fast (two krill per second in swarms) and efficient (244 krill or 33 P. borchgrevinki in 78-89 min). Prey captures were detected by the signal of head acceleration relative to body acceleration with high sensitivity and specificity (0.83-0.90), as shown by receiver-operating characteristic analysis. Extension of signal analysis to the entire behavioral records showed that krill captures were spatially and temporally more variable than P. borchgrevinki captures. Notably, the frequency distribution of krill capture rate closely followed a power-lawmodel, indicating that the foraging success of penguins depends on a small number of very successful dives. The three steps illustrated here (i.e., video observations, linking video to behavioral signals, and extension of signal analysis) are unique approaches to understanding the spatial and temporal variability of ecologically important events such as foraging.

Energy and materials for reproduction may also be totally derived from stored lipid and bodily protein. The predominant storage products are wax esters, often visible as translucent droplets or a fusiform inclusion in the tissues. Lipid may constitute more than 50% of dry weight at the end of summer. Reproduction is synchronized with season and environmental conditions to enable offspring to exploit the brief period of intense primary production. So far as we know, fertilization occurs only once in the copepods studied here, which make up more than 98% of the total zooplankton by numbers, and males are short lived, but in one species (Calanus hyperboreus) females may survive into a second productive season, thereby storing sufficient reserves to spawn a second time. Several planktonic species, including larval invertebrates, start growth early by utilizing algae that develop on the under-ice surface several months before the pelagic phytoplankton bloom. The minimum water temperature (-1.8-degrees-C) is constant and much warmer than the atmosphere, so overwintering should be less stressful for aquatic species than for terrestrial forms. Additional adaptations used by zooplankton in winter include seeking deeper water to escape predation, reducing swimming costs by regulating buoyancy, and further lowering metabolic rates by limiting synthesis of enzymes and increasing the fraction of lipid used in respiration.																	0004-0843					DEC	1993	46	4					303	311									WOS:A1993MQ45000004

The main prey of short-tailed shearwaters Puffinus tenuirostris (P. ten.), white-chinned petrels Procellaria aequinoctialis (P. aeq.), blue petrels Halobaena caerulea (H cae.), thin-billed prions Pachyptila belcheri (P. bel.), and Antarctic prions Pachyptila desolata (P. des.) were mostly deduced from the lipid analysis of adult stomach oils. More than 97% of the 125 analyzed oils mainly consisted of wax esters (WEs) and triacylglycerols (TAGS) (> 70% of total lipids). WE fatty alcohol (FAlc), WE fatty acid (FA), and TAG-FA profiles clearly segregated P. aeq. from P. ten., with smaller, but still significant, differences among the three other petrel species. P. aeq. and P. ten. therefore preyed on distinct prey species, whereas H. cae., P. bel., and P. des. had a more similar diet, but still with some prey differences. Comparisons between FAlc and FA patterns of oils with those of potential prey species showed that > 93% of FAlc and FA patterns of oil WEs had a high probability of resemblance with the myctophid signatures, and similar results were obtained with the TAG fractions. Almost no stomach oil fit the lipid patterns of subantarctic and Antarctic euphausiids, including those of the WE-rich Thysanoessa macrura and the TAG-rich Antarctic krill Euphausia superba. This study thus demonstrates for the first time the importance of myctophids in the nutrition of adult flying seabirds breeding in subantarctic islands and foraging in Antarctic waters during the austral summer.

Palmer', we: (1) assessed the habitat chosen for moulting by emperor penguins, Aptenodytes forsteri, (2) determined their pre- and post-moult diets, (3) measured the pre- and post-moult body mass of the birds, and (4) tracked their post-moult movements. Diet was based on the colour of guano near the edges of ice floes and fast-ice areas. Pre- and post-moult birds were weighed at locations along the transect. Satellite transmitters were attached to 7 birds, and tracked for up to 5 mo. Birds moulted in concentrated pack ice and coastal fast ice. Offshore from the shelf slope, diet was mostly Antarctic krill Euphausia superba. Over the shelf, the diet was mainly fish and squid. Body masses of birds immediately after the moult were often less than 20 kg. After moult, satellite tracked birds remained in the pack ice but moved to the west at a rate of 13 to 41 km d(-1). One bird traveled to the Cape Roget colony, where it arrived on 15 April after 70 d and 2140 km of travel. We conclude that (1) birds are close to starvation by the end of the moult, (2) it is essential that an abundant food supply is in close proximity to the moult area, (3) penguins travel more than 2000 km on the return journey to their colonies of the western Ross Sea, and (4) reduction in the extent and seasonal duration of the pack ice would be reflected in a rapid change in the size of the breeding population of coastal west Antarctica.					, gerald/0000-0002-8872-2950												0171-8630	1616-1599					2004	267						281	290		10.3354/meps267281							WOS:000220562100023

The life phases showed differences in distribution. After the start of reproduction, which was well underway in December across shelf and open waters of the straits, the January distribution of larvae expanded with concentrations near the Peninsula, along the main Bransfield Current, and, to a lesser extent, around the South Shetlands. In February the distribution retracted toward the Peninsula as abundance diminished greatly. By March, larvae were found only north of the South Shetlands and in Gerlache Strait area where highest numbers had been observed through the season. Juveniles, believed to be 1 year old, and subadults, 2 years old, appeared to be randomly dispersed across the region at all times. Our few specimens of the adult class were from within or near embayments. Most December larvae were nauplii, metanauplii and Calyptopis 1. In January, older calyptopis stages were dominant. Latest observed eggs and nauplii were in January inside the Deception Island caldera. During February to March, development progressed from the calyptopis phase to the furcilia phase, and mean abundance of larvae declined from the > 100 m-2 level of January to < 10 m-2. Most late March larvae were furcilia stages 2 and 3, averaging one stage less than the more rapidly growing E. superba which had begun reproduction about a month later than E. crystallorophias. The Year-1 cohort was recognized in December as 12-16 mm juveniles, dispersed across the strait at mean abundances like those of the Year-0 larval class in March. The juveniles were about 15-21 mm by February, and there was no apparent growth through March. Subadults and adults were sparse in these open waters. Based on earlier year-round data on older E. crystallorophias from Poland's research station at Admiralty Bay, there seem to be two post-juvenile year classes. Our subadults fit into that pattern and are considered Year-2. Late in Year-2 and during Year-3 (maturity), females grew to a larger size than males and were more numerous.																	0198-0149					AUG-SEP	1991	38	8-9					1195	1211		10.1016/0198-0149(91)90102-L							WOS:A1991GH34600014

Intrinsic and extrinsic forcing in life histories: patterns of growth and stable isotopes in male Antarctic fur seal teeth	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												Life-time records of the trophic sources of carbon, nitrogen and of growth rate can be generated from biogenic structures that show accretionary growth, including fish scales, whale baleen and the teeth of some animals. Records generated from individual teeth can also be combined to provide longer time series elucidating changes in environmental conditions encountered by a population. Both intrinsic (i.e. ontogenetic) and extrinsic (i.e. environmental) factors are important in modulating variation in growth and the apparent dietary sources of C and N. We used the canine teeth of a large marine predator, the male Antarctic fur seal Arctocephalus gazella from South Georgia, to investigate both intrinsic and extrinsic sources of variation. Substantial ontogenetic shifts occurred in both delta C-13 and delta N-15 values in individual teeth, indicating a change in the trophic sources of C and N as individual animals age. Over the 40 yr period from 1964 to 2005, and after statistical reduction of ontogenetic variation, we also detected long-term declines in delta C-13 and delta N-15 values, indicating that the population has become more dependent on energy from a lower trophic level. A concurrent decline in annular tooth growth may be a consequence of rapid population growth during this period. The time series of delta C-13 values was also inversely correlated with sea surface temperatures in the region, although isolating a causal relationship remains elusive. Our analyses suggest that both intrinsic and extrinsic sources of variation, and their interaction, must be considered from Such time series data; failure to do so could result in a biased interpretation.

Maximum values (up to 1.3 mmol m(-3)) occurred around local midnight and minimum values (down to 0.1 mmol m(-3)) close to noon. This cyclicity was not found in other nutrients analysed (silicate, nitrate, nitrite and phos- phate). The potential for mixing ammonium-rich water from the pycnocline into the surface mixed layer (SML) at night is examined. Budget calculations for both ammonium and temperature suggest that complete mixing of the pycnocline water into the SML would increase concentration to observed levels. However, it would also give rise to changes in pycnocline ammonium concentration and temperatures which do not agree with observations. Moreover, such a model will not account for daytime drawdown, which is likely to be due to biological processes. A simple biological model combining night time excretion of ammonium by zooplankton and daytime uptake by phytoplankton simulates the observed change, but only if (i) the daily-averaged phytoplankton growth rate was of the order of 0.5-1 day(-1), (ii) this growth was strongly dependent on ammonium for its nitrogen nutrition, (iii) zooplankton grazing was sufficient to keep phytoplankton biomass at a constant level and (iv) much of the ingested nitrogen was excreted. The implications of these conditions are explored in the context of other observations during the study, and on the basis of published data. It appears that the re supply of inorganic nitrogen through zooplankton grazing may have been important in sustaining primary production, indicating a very tight coupling between grazers and their food supply. This conclusion is supported by comparison with results from a similar cruise in 1994. Then there was a reduction in the biomass of Antarctic krill, a major component of the zooplankton, to 14% of that observed in 1996. Diurnal change in ammonium concentration could not be detected and phytoplankton growth rate had been slower (about 0.25 d(-1)), providing support for the suggestion that biological processes were more important than physical mixing in generating ammonium cyclicity. The potential consequences for the biological cycling of carbon in high-and low-krill abundance years are discussed.

Maud Rise - a snapshot through the water column	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY												The benthic fauna was investigated during the expedition ANT-XXIV/2 (2007/08) in relation to oceanographic features, biogeochemical properties and sediment characteristics, as well as the benthic, pelagic and air-breathing fauna. The results document that Maud Rise (MR) differs distinctly from surrounding deep-sea basins investigated during previous Southern Ocean expeditions (ANDEEP 2002, 2005). Considering all taxa, the overall similarity between MR and adjacent stations was low (similar to 20% Bray-Curtis-Similarity), and analyses of single taxa show obvious differences in species composition, abundances and densities. The composition and diversity of bivalves of MR are characterised by extremely high abundances of three species, especially the small sized Vesicomya spp. Exceptionally high gastropod abundance at MR is due to the single species Onoba subantarctica wilkesiana, a small brooder that may prey upon abundant benthic foraminiferas. The abundance and diversity of isopods also show that one family. Haplomunnidae, occurs with a surprisingly high number of individuals at MR while this family was not found at any of the 40 bathyal and abyssal ANDEEP stations. Similarly, polychaetes, especially the tube-dwelling, suspension-feeder fraction, are represented by species not found at the comparison stations. Sponges comprise almost exclusively small specimens in relatively high numbers, especially a few species of Polymastiidae. Water-column sampling from the surface to the seafloor, including observations of top predators, indicate the existence of a prospering pelagic food web. Local concentrations of top predators and zooplankton are associated with a rich ice-edge bloom located over the northern slope of MR. There the sea ice melts, which is probably accelerated by the advection of warm water at intermediate depth. Over the southern slope, high concentrations of Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) occur under dense sea ice and attract Antarctic Minke Whales (Balaenoptera bonaerensis) and several seabird species. These findings suggest that biological prosperity over MR is related to both oceanographic and sea-ice processes. Downward transport of the organic matter produced in the pelagic realm may be more constant than elsewhere due to low lateral drift over MR. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Antarctic krill comprised over 90% of prey items and formed 47% of the diet by weight; fish and squid occurred in 67% and 35% of samples and formed 33% and 19% of the diet by weight, respectively. Decapods, amphipods and salps occurred in a few samples. The fish were mainly lanternfish (Myctophidae) of eight species (chiefly Electrona and Gymnoscopelus, forming 80% by number and 52% by mass of fish prey) and the nototheniid Patagonotothen guntheri (14% by number and 35% by mass). Of squid taken, the ommastrephid Martialia hyadesi comprised 57% by number and 52% by mass and the gonatid Gonatus antarcticus 14% by number and 42% by mass. These dietary data confirm white-chinned petrel as the most important avian consumer of fish and squid at South Georgia (and the third most important consumer of krill). In 1986 the nototheniid fish were probably obtained via commercial fishing operations but the myctophids and squid were probably live-caught, most likely at night. Meal size increased rapidly until chicks were three weeks old and then remained constant until the chicks were within 10 days of fledging, when it decreased. Meal delivery rate was high (one per day) for young chicks (1-10 days old) and thereafter fluctuated between 0.56 and 0.88 meals per day until close to fledging, when it was halved. These provisioning rates, and the proportion of krill in the diet, are higher than those recorded previously at South Georgia and Indian Ocean sites, probably reflecting high local availability of krill at South Georgia in 1986. In many respects, white-chinned petrels at South Georgia are intermediate ecologically between prions and albatrosses, although specialized in their extensive consumption of myctophids. Because krill and ail the main fish prey are currently the targets of substantial commercial fishing and the main squid prey (Martialia) is a potential target, the ecological role and status of white-chinned petrels are of additional importance.

Penguins and Seals Transport Limiting Nutrients Between Offshore Pelagic and Coastal Regions of Antarctica Under Changing Sea Ice	ECOSYSTEMS												Large animals such as sea birds and marine mammals can transport limiting nutrients between different regions of the ocean, thereby stimulating and enhancing productivity. In Antarctica this process is influenced by formation and breakup of sea ice and its influence on the feeding behaviour of predators and their prey. We used analyses of bioactive metals (for example, Fe, Co, Mn), macronutrients (for example, N) and stable isotopes (delta C-13 and delta N-15) in the excreta of Adelie (Pygoscelis adeliae) and emperor penguins (Aptenodytes forsteri) as well as Weddell seals (Leptonychotes weddellii) from multiple sites, among multiple years (2012-2014) to resolve how changes in sea ice dynamics, as indicated by MODIS satellite images, were coincident with prey switching and likely changes in nutrient fluxes between the offshore pelagic and coastal zones. We also sampled excreta of the south polar skua (Stercorarius maccormicki), which preys on penguins and scavenges the remains of both penguins and seals. We found strong coincidence of isotopic evidence for prey switching, between euphausiids (Euphausia superba and E. crystallorophias) and pelagic/cryopelagic fishes (for example, Pleuragramma antarcticum) in penguins, and between pelagic/cryopelagic fishes and Antarctic toothfish (Dissostichus mawsoni) in Weddell seals, with changes in sea ice cover among years. Further, prey switching was strongly linked to changes in the concentrations of nutrients (Fe and N) deposited in coastal environments by both penguins and seals. Our findings have important implications for understanding how the roles of large animals in supporting coastal productivity may shift with environmental conditions in polar ecosystems.

Recruitment of toothfish varies inter-annually, and a single large cohort dominated during the four years surveyed. Most juveniles were caught on the Shag Rocks shelf to the NW of South Georgia, with fish subsequently dispersing to deeper water around both the South Georgia and Shag Rocks shelves. Mean size of juvenile toothfish increased with depth of capture. Stomach contents analysis was conducted on 795 fish that contained food remains and revealed that juvenile toothfish are essentially piscivorous, with the diet dominated by notothenid fish. The yellow-finned notothen, Patagonotothen guntheri, was the dominant prey at Shag Rocks whilst at South Georgia, where P. guntheri is absent, the dominant prey were Antarctic krill and notothenid fish. The diet changed with size, with an increase in myctophid fish and krill as toothfish grow and disperse. The size of prey also increased with fish size, with a greater range of prey sizes consumed by larger fish.

A separation of the stomach into an anterior part, called cardia, and a posterior part, called pylorus, became evident. Protrusions of the stomach into the midgut form the third region, called the funnel. The interior of the cardia is dominated by the two lateralia, originating from the side walls of the stomach. At their undersurface, they bear the primary filter. It separates the dorsal food channel from the ventral filtration channel, which is divided into two channels by a ventromedian ridge, the anteromedianum. Within the pylorus, the inferolateralia act in sealing the food channel from the filtration channel. In contrast to many other Malacostraca, the inferomedianum bears no secondary filter. During live observations, the stomach of Euphausia superba shows distinct pumping phases. A comparison of the structure of the stomach with data obtained from other Crustacea will lead to a better understanding about the relationships between the Malacostraca.

J	Pages, F				Pages, F			The gelatinous zooplankton in the pelagic system of the southern ocean: A review	ANNALES DE L INSTITUT OCEANOGRAPHIQUE												The classic view of the Antarctic planktonic system has suggested that food web dynamics are dominated by the phytoplankton-krill food web link. Recent observations, however, have indicated that this is an oversimplification and that the Antarctic food web is much more complicated. In contrast to crustaceans, gelatinous zooplankton (hydroidomedusae, siphonophores, scyphomedusae, ctenophores, gymnosomatous pteropods and tunicates such as salps, doliolids, pyrosomes and appendicularians) have received little attention among zooplanktologists in spite of the high biovolume that they contribute to the zooplankton communities. Gelatinous zooplankton comprises a quarter of the planktonic species number collected in the Southern Ocean although many additional species remain undescribed. This review considers the published information on spatial distribution, abundance, wet biomass, carbon and lipid content, feeding ecology and biological associations. The sparse but significant information collected suggests that the ecological role of gelatinous zooplankton is underestimated in the Antarctic pelagic system. Sampling methods and investigations that correctly evaluate the impact of gelatinous organisms are extremely necessary for properly placing this group in the Antarctic trophic web.																	0078-9682						1997	73	2					139	158									WOS:000074814000003

We examined the diet and foraging dynamics of breeding macaroni penguins Eudyptes chrysolophus from sub-Antarctic Heard Island and related these to prey distributions derived from active-acoustics and net-derived data in the foraging zone of the penguins. Consistent with previous findings, we found that penguin diets changed between the guard and creche stages of the breeding cycle and that this change in diet corresponded with a switch from short foraging trips in the guard stage to significantly longer, offshore foraging trips in the creche stage. We related these differences in diet and foraging to characteristics of the prey field-specifically, a relatively uniform distribution of krill over the shelf and in deeper, offshore waters, compared with an increasing abundance of fish further from shore. We developed a simple dynamic energy budget for macaroni penguins to explore whether targeting fish during the creche stage was an energetically favourable strategy. Finally, we extrapolated our energy budget to estimate prey consumption at the colony scale as previous work has suggested that depletion near breeding colonies could contribute to prey switching. We found that prey switching during the creche stage was energetically favourable and was most likely related to a reduction in foraging constraints, rather than prey depletion. This study shows the value of integrating data sets to address questions surrounding variation in diet and the use of alternative prey by marine predators.

Theoretical estimates of target strength based on a straight cylinder model and applied to the numbers and sizes of euphausiids in net samples yielded estimates of mean volume backscattering strength (MVBS) that compared favorably with observed values at low abundances. However, net samples underestimated biomass by almost two orders of magnitude at high abundances, a feature we attribute to net avoidance. Other taxonomic groups of macrozooplankton did not appear to contribute significantly to acoustic backscatter. Distributions of euphausiids were similar to those observed in summer; we found no evidence for abundant aggregations immediately below surface sea-ice. Euphausia superba dominated the biomass at all stations; individuals of approximately 22 mm were most abundant at 30-70 m depth, whereas 40-mm individuals were most abundant at 90-130 m. Thysanoessa macrura was positioned deeper in the water column, from 150 to 250 m, and Euphausia crystallorophias was centered on 100 m. The first two species were distributed throughout the study area, but E. crystallorophias was concentrated in coastal embayments. Total wet weight biomass ranged from 0.009 to 92 g m-3, dry weight ranged from 0.002 to 18 g m-3, and protein ranged from 0.0009 to 9 g m-3, mostly concentrated in the 30-70 m depth stratum. Over the upper 200 m of the water column integrated wet weight biomass estimated from ADCP data was in the range from 29 g m-2 to 92 kg m-2.																	0967-0637	1879-0119				SEP	1994	41	9					1425	1445		10.1016/0967-0637(94)90106-6							WOS:A1994PM49300009						
J	PUTZ, K				PUTZ, K			THE POST MOLT DIET OF EMPEROR PENGUINS (APTENODYTES FORSTERI) IN THE EASTERN WEDDELL SEA, ANTARCTICA	POLAR BIOLOGY												The diet of emperor penguins Aptenodytes forsteri was studied during late austral summer at Drescher Inlet, eastern Weddell Sea, Antarctica. Antarctic krill Euphausia superba was a major component of the food, accounting for 75% of all prey items. Emperor penguins appear to feed on krill during shallow dives under the fast sea ice. Fish, mainly nototheniids, accounted for less than 20% by number of all prey. An evaluation of the main prey types in terms of mass indicated, however, that fish represented up to 75% approximately of prey mass. Feeding experiments were performed on captive penguins and showed that squid beaks can accumulate for up to 3 weeks within the stomach without any clear signs of erosion. The lack of cephalopod soft parts in the samples makes it likely that all squid beaks were derived from animals captured some time previously. Squid seems to be a very minor dietary component of emperor penguins at the Drescher Inlet.

The diets contained either 100% fishmeal or fishmeal that was replaced with 25%, 50%, or 100% amphipod meal or 50% or 100% Antarctic krill meal. Cod larvae were start-fed on rotifers and weaned directly to one of the six formulated feeds at a mean wet weight of 28 mg, 40 days post first-feeding. The mean weight of fish reared on different diets at the end of the experiment ranged from 0.92 to 2.52 g. The best growth was obtained by cod fed 100% fishmeal and 50% krill meal. There was a trend in the direction of slower growth with increasing levels of amphipod meal in the diets. Survival ranged from 87% to 79%, and there was a tendency for higher mortality with increasing content of amphipod meal. The liver index varied between 11.7% and 9.9%. The composition of the diets also had a significant influence on the occurrence of skeletal deformities. The highest proportion of deformities (16% of all fish) was in fish fed 100% amphipod meal, decreasing as the proportion of amphipod meal in the diets declined. A similar effect was not seen with Antarctic krill meal. The amphipod meal had a high content of ash, fluoride, cadmium, and mercury, which may have caused the deformities.(c) 2006 international Council for the Exploration of the Sea.

The seasonal succession of zooplankton in the Southern Ocean south of Australia, part I: The seasonal ice zone	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART I-OCEANOGRAPHIC RESEARCH PAPERS												Between November 2001 and March 2002 an Australian/Japanese collaborative study completed six passes of a transect line in the Seasonal-Ice Zone (south of 62 degrees S) along 140 degrees E. Zooplankton samples were collected with a NORPAC net on 22-28 November, and a Continuous Plankton Recorder on 10-15 January, 11-12 February, 19-22 February, 25-26 February, and 10-11 March. Zooplankton densities were lowest on 22-28 November (ave = 61 individuals (ind) m(-3)), when almost the entire transect was covered by sea ice. By 10-15 January sea surface temperature had increased by similar to 2 degrees C across the transect line, and the study area was ice-free. Total zooplankton abundance had increased to maximum levels for the season (ave = 1301 ind m(-3); max = 1979 ind m(-3)), dominated by a "Peak Community" comprising Oithona similis, Ctenocalanus citer, Clausocalanus laticeps, foraminiferans, Limacina spp., appendicularians, Rhincalanus gigas and large calanoid copepodites (C1-3). Total densities declined on each subsequent transect, returning to an average of 169 ind m-3 on 10-11 March. The seasonal density decline was due to the decline in densities of "Peak Community" taxa, but coincided with the rise of Euphausia superba larvae into the surface waters, increased densities of Salpa thompsoni, and an increased contribution of C4 to adult stages to the populations of Calanoides acutus, Calanus propinquus and Calanus simillimus. The seasonal community succession appeared to be influenced by the low sea ice extent and southward projection of the ACC in this region. The relatively warm ACC waters, together with low krill biomass, favoured high densities of small grazers during the January/February bloom conditions. The persistence of relatively warm surface waters in March and the seasonal decrease in chlorophyll a biomass provided favorable conditions for salps, which were able to penetrate south of the Southern Boundary.

Discovery in the Bellingshausen Sea from 23 November to 7 December 1992 as part of the U.K. Joint Global Ocean Flux Study (JGOFS) Southern Ocean investigations [Turner D. and N.J.P. Owens (1995) Deep-Sea Research II, 42, 907-932]. A total of 285 targets were identified and described from the chart record of the echo sounder. Mean volume backscattering strength data were collected using an echo integration system. These data are used to describe the spatial and temporal variability of kriII (Euphausia superba) distribution and biomass in the marginal ice-edge zone. Krill biomass density varied from a mean of 32 g m(-2) during the first survey phase to 20 g m(-2) on the second survey phase. The number of small swarms detected during the second phase was greater than during the first phase. On this first survey a large swarm (2.8 km in extent) had a potential biomass of 3.7 x 10(4) tonnes. Some calculations are presented to show the potential impact of krill on the flux of carbon in the area of the survey.																	0967-0645						1995	42	4-5					1159	1175		10.1016/0967-0645(95)00059-Y							WOS:A1995RV69700015

Based on dated subsamples from a sediment core, I conclude that penguins have been present in Hope Bay since 5550 BP, with the exception of a short period around 5300 BP. Their influence on the lake sediment reached a maximum at c. 40 BP and has drastically declined since then. The rookery started to grow between 850 and 1250 BP due to a climate deterioration. The increased amount of food (mainly krill), caused by extensive fur seal hunting in the nineteenth century was probably not enough to affect rookery growth. However, the drastic decline in whale stock in the 1930's and 1940's and the subsequent increase in krill abundance may have enhanced rookery growth. The increasing disturbance by man in Hope Bay seems only to have changed the shape of the rookery and the penguins paths to the sea, but not to have stopped the growth of the rookery.																	0906-7590					DEC	1994	17	4					297	304		10.1111/j.1600-0587.1994.tb00106.x							WOS:A1994QC88900002

Bulk microplanktonic settling volumes were assessed, silicoflagellates and large thecate dinoflagellates were counted, and tintinnids were counted and identified to species. Average (and maximum) values for the entire area surveyed were as follows, settling volume: 6.7 (43.3) ml/m3; silicoflagellates: 674 (7777) ind./l, 0.57 (6.54) mg C/m3; dinoflagellates; 109 (1321) ind./l, 1.40 (16.98) mg C/m3; tintinnids: 52 (589) ind./l 1.15 (9.87) mg C/m3. The three geographic zones defined objectively on the basis of tintinnid specific assemblages also differed sharply in their surface salinity, overall microplanktonic abundance and bulk settling volume. The Bransfield Strait, with lowest settling volume values (2.1 ml/m3) and cell concentrations, was characterized by the dominance of Cymatocylis affinis/convallaria. In waters around the tip of the Antarctic Peninsula microplanktonic settling volumes averaged 4.6 ml/m3, cell concentrations were intermediate, and 79% of the tintinnids were represented by Codonellopsis balechi. The Bellingshausen Sea was characterized by the lowest salinities and the highest settling volumes (8.7 ml/m3) and cell counts; Laackmanniella spp. and Cymatocylis drygalskii, f. typica dominated this area. Almost all biological variables were significantly intercorrelated, and showed strong and mostly significant negative correlations with surface salinity, yet relationships between enhanced standing stock and ice meltwater were not obvious; rather, highest microplanktonic concentrations seemed to be due to ice-associated growth. Extremely high spatial correlations were found between the tintinnids and the dinoflagellates (r2: 0.941), suggesting the existence of close links between these two groups. Tintinnid species-specific assemblages show a coherent distributional pattern and well defined environment-related trends; most clearly differentiated preferences are exhibited by Laackmanniella prolongata (closely associated with ice-covered areas), Cymatocylis affinis/convallaria (oligotrophic open-ocean waters), and Codonellopsis balechi (coastal regions).

High densities of minke whales and large aggregations of euphausiids were observed along the ice edge over the continental slope in the southeast region of area IV and in the southwest region of area V. The results suggest that the continental slope zone that coincides with the ice edge would be an important minke whale feeding area. Minke whales were rarely sighted in the offshore region even if euphausiids were abundant. Distributions of humpback whales were correlated with high euphausiid density zones, regardless of the bottom topographic features. Several groups of blue whales were sighted in the small area along the ice edge where euphausiids were abundant, but sightings were too few to draw any general conclusion about the relationship between blue whales and euphausiids. Both baleen whales and euphausiids were scarce in the area east of 170degreesW where sea ice covered the continental shelf and slope zone.

Sixty-five years later the CPR as a Type II version returned to Antarctic waters when the Australian Antarctic Division initiated a survey of the Southern Ocean on RSV Aurora Australis south of Australia and west to Mawson. The objectives are to study regional, seasonal, interannual and long-term variability in zooplankton abundance, species composition and community patterns, as well as the annual abundance and distribution of krill larvae. The survey covers a large area from 60degreesE to 160degreesE, and south from about 48degreesS to the Antarctic coast-an area of more than 14 million km(2). Tows are conducted throughout the shipping season, normally September to April, but occasionally as early as July (midwinter). The large areal and temporal scale means that it is difficult to separate temporal and geographical variation in the data. Hence, CPRs are now also towed on the Japanese icebreaker Shirase in collaboration with the Japanese Antarctic programme. Shirase has a fixed route and time schedule, travelling south on 110degreesE in early December and north on 150degreesE in mid-March each year, and will serve as an important temporal reference for measuring long-term interannual variability and to help interpret the Australian data. Since 1991, over 90 tows have been made, providing over 36,000 nautical miles of records. The most successful seasons to date have been the 1997/1998, 1999/2000 and 2000/2001 austral summers with 20, 31 and 26 tows, respectively. The 1999/2000 season included a unique, nearly simultaneous three-ship crossing of the Southern Ocean along 25degrees 30'E, 110degreesE and 157degreesE. Typical CPR tows show very high abundance of zooplankton in the uppermost 20 m of the permanently open ocean zone between the sea-ice zone and the Sub-Antarctic Front; this is an area thought to be oligotrophic. Appendicularians and small calanoid and cyclopoid copepods dominate the plankton. By comparison the surface waters of the sea-ice zone have low species diversity and abundances. Zooplankton data, and hence distribution patterns, can be time- and geo-coded to GPS data and environmental data collected by the ships' underway monitoring system (e.g. fluorescence, water temperature, salinity, and meteorological data).

ANTARCTIC SCIENCE												The identification and quantification of Antarctic Pygoscelis penguin colonies depends increasingly on recognition of the characteristic optical properties of guano deposits, but almost all knowledge of these properties until now has been compromised by resolution and atmospheric propagation effects. Here we present hyperspectral reflectance data in the range 350-2500 nm, collected in situ from fresh guano deposits in Pygoscelis penguin colonies on Signy Island, South Orkney Islands. The period of data collection included the transition from predominantly white guano to the pink coloration characteristic of a krill-rich diet. The main identifiable features in the spectra are a broad absorption feature centred around 550 nm, responsible for the pink coloration and identified with the pigment astaxanthin, as well as several water absorption features. Variations in these features are responsible for differentiation between spectra. From these results we propose two spectral indices suitable for use with satellite data, one of which responds to the presence of astaxanthin in the guano and the other to water. Our results do not allow us to differentiate between penguin species from their guano, but do suggest that the breeding phenology of Pygoscelis penguins could be determined from a time series of multispectral imagery.

J	Kirkwood, R; Robertson, G				Kirkwood, R; Robertson, G			Seasonal change in the foraging ecology of emperor penguins on the Mawson Coast, Antarctica	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												We investigated the foraging location, diving behaviour, dietary composition, feeding rates and foraging trip durations of emperor penguins Aptenodytes forsteri raising chicks at the Auster and Taylor Glacier colonies on the Mawson Coast of Antarctica in the winter, spring and early summer of 1993, to examine seasonal changes in the penguins' foraging ecology. As day-length increased after winter, the penguins' daily swimming time increased from 7.83 +/- 1.50 h in August to 12.23 +/- 1.25 h in September and 12.95 +/- 1.24 h in October. Accordingly, the penguins' dive rate increased from 92.7 +/- 28.5 to 149.4 +/- 23.4 and 161.6 +/- 19.3 dives d(-1) in the respective months. The birds targeted prey in the vicinity of the continental slope mainly at depths <100 m, although some individuals frequently hunted at depths >200 m, and the maximum depth achieved was 438 m. Antarctic krill Euphausia superba were the most common prey taken overall, 41% of the diet by mass, and dominated the diets between August and October. The contribution of Antarctic krill to the diet reduced over time from 68% in August to 1% in early December. In November, the glacier squid Psychroteuthis glacialis dominated the diet (47 to 63%), and in early December the diet comprised various species of fish, Trematomus species (27%), Pagothenia borchgrevinki (24%), and Pleuragramma antarcticum (8%), and squid, P. glacialis (13%) and Alluroteuthis antarcticus (9%). The birds' prey consumption rates more than doubled between late winter and early summer, from 4.0 +/- 1.0 to 8.7 +/- 1.7 kg d(-1) spent foraging; these values are equivalent to metabolisable energy intakes of 628 +/- 134 and 1422 +/- 308 kJ kg(-1) d(-1), respectively. During brooding (late winter to early spring), females spent less time at sea than males (8.7 +/- 2.7 vs 17.7 +/- 3.8 d); thereafter trip durations of both sexes were similar and declined from 15-19 d in spring to <10 d in early summer. Between hatching and about 1 wk prior to fledging each parent fed its chick 7 or 8 times. To raise a chick, females and males consumed approximately 410 and 470 kg of prey respectively, or 880 kg for each breeding pair. Seasonal variations in the penguins' foraging were probably influenced by fluctuating sea-ice conditions, differences in the prey types available, changes in day-length toward summer, and increasing demands of the growing chicks.																	0171-8630						1997	156						205	223		10.3354/meps156205							WOS:A1997XZ98100020

Persistent organic pollutants in blubber of fin whales (Balaenoptera physalus) from the Southern Ocean	MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN												Persistent organic pollutants (POPs) were analyzed in eighteen blubber samples biopsied from fin whales (Balaenoptera physalus) during the feeding season near the Antarctic Peninsula in the summer of 2013. POP content (in ng g(-1) lipid weight) ranged from 46.4 to 708 for polychlorinated biphenyls (Sigma PCBs), 6.77 to 123 for hexachlorobenzene (HCB), 10.1 to 489 for dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane and derivatives (Sigma DDTs), 5.38 to 52.8 for hexachlorocyclohexanes (Sigma HCH) and < 0.40 to 2.54 for polybrominated diphenyl ethers (Sigma PBDEs). The presence of those compounds in Southern Ocean fin whales is related to long-range transport and their diet based mainly on euphausiids (krill). Their contents were much lower compared to the same species in other locations, especially in the Northern Hemisphere, presumably due to differences in trophic position and the proximity of POP sources and contamination of prey items.

K.; Clarke, Sarah; Collins, Martin A.; Belchier, Mark			Distribution and ecology of Chaenocephalus aceratus (Channichthyidae) around South Georgia and Shag Rocks (Southern Ocean)	POLAR BIOLOGY												Chaenocephalus aceratus (Family Channicthyidae) is one of the dominant species of demersal fish living on the South Georgia shelf where it is caught in low numbers as by-catch in the mackerel icefish and Antarctic krill commercial fisheries. Data collected during 14 demersal fish surveys, from 1986 to 2006, are analysed to investigate biomass, distribution, growth and diet. Biomass estimates from a swept area method ranged from 4,462 to 28,740 tonnes on the South Georgia and Shag Rock shelves although few fish were caught at Shag Rocks. Analysis of length frequency data indicated that growth was fast in the first five years with males and females attaining lengths at first spawning of 440 mm TL and 520 mm TL. The diet was comprised of fish and crustaceans, with an ontogenetic shift in diet from Euphausia superba and mysids to benthic fish and decapods observed to begin at 250 mm TL. In larger fish (> 500 mm TL) the diet was dominated by fish. C. aceratus diet is sufficiently different from the other species of channichthyids around South Georgia to suggest that these species have undergone resource partitioning.				, Martin/ABE-6728-2020; Collins, Martin A/J-8560-2017; Reid, William/J-8528-2013	Reid, William/0000-0003-0190-0425												0722-4060	1432-2056				NOV	2007	30	12					1523	1533		10.1007/s00300-007-0313-z							WOS:000249920800002

Povl; Jullion, Loic; Messias, Marie-Jose			Circulation, retention, and mixing of waters within the Weddell-Scotia Confluence, Southern Ocean: The role of stratified Taylor columns	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS												The waters of the Weddell-Scotia Confluence (WSC) lie above the rugged topography of the South Scotia Ridge in the Southern Ocean. Meridional exchanges across the WSC transfer water and tracers between the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) to the north and the subpolar Weddell Gyre to the south. Here, we examine the role of topographic interactions in mediating these exchanges, and in modifying the waters transferred. A case study is presented using data from a free-drifting, intermediate-depth float, which circulated anticyclonically over Discovery Bank on the South Scotia Ridge for close to 4 years. Dimensional analysis indicates that the local conditions are conducive to the formation of Taylor columns. Contemporaneous ship-derived transient tracer data enable estimation of the rate of isopycnal mixing associated with this column, with values of O(1000 m(2)/s) obtained. Although necessarily coarse, this is of the same order as the rate of isopycnal mixing induced by transient mesoscale eddies within the ACC. A picture emerges of the Taylor column acting as a slow, steady blender, retaining the waters in the vicinity of the WSC for lengthy periods during which they can be subject to significant modification. A full regional float data set, bathymetric data, and a Southern Ocean state estimate are used to identify other potential sites for Taylor column formation. We find that they are likely to be sufficiently widespread to exert a significant influence on water mass modification and meridional fluxes across the southern edge of the ACC in this sector of the Southern Ocean.

J	GROHSLER, T				GROHSLER, T			FEEDING-HABITS AS INDICATORS OF ECOLOGICAL NICHES - INVESTIGATIONS OF ANTARCTIC FISH CONDUCTED NEAR ELEPHANT ISLAND IN LATE AUTUMN WINTER 1986	ARCHIVE OF FISHERY AND MARINE RESEARCH												The stomach contents of 18 fish species caught in the late autumn/winter 1986 near Elephant Island (61-degrees 15'S, 54-degrees 30' W) using bottom trawls from on board the FS ''Polarstern'' (ANT V/1) were investigated using the method of cluster analysis. These analyses have led to a good description of food niches. Trophic types found in this region were plankton, plankton/benthos, benthos/plankton or nekton feeders as well as benthos feeders. Each of these trophic types is represented in the family of the Nototheniidae, represented by 8 species in our investigations. Interspecific competition among the fish species studied appears to be reduced by the vertical structure of their habitat. Food distribution overlap is only slight among fish species with similar feeding styles and behaviours, although krill (Euphausia superba Dana 1852) is almost always an important component of the food supply.																	0944-1921						1994	42	1					17	34									WOS:A1994NP71600002						
J	Xu, QC; Huang, LY; Li, XS; Li, YY; Zhao, XY				Xu, Qingchang; Huang, Liuyi; Li, Xiansen; Li, Yuyan; Zhao, Xianyong			Parameter optimization of a rectangular cambered otter board using response surface method	OCEAN ENGINEERING												Otter boards are important device that provide a desired horizontal opening of a mid-water trawl net. High lift coefficients are essential for an otter board to maintain favorable fishing efficiency, especially for fishing target like Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) which is often found in layers very close to the sea surface. Response surface method (RSM) was used to optimize the parameters of a rectangular cambered otter board in this study. The aspect ratio (0.8-2.0), maximum relative camber (2%-18%), and maximum camber position (10%-50%) were adopted as the independent variables. Hydrodynamic performances of twenty otter board models were simulated using numerical simulation. Results showed that RSM was applicable to describe the relationship between the selected variables and the maximum lift coefficient. The maximum lift coefficient was significantly affected by these three variables. An optimal otter was extracted in the optimal solutions, and the optimal parameters of aspect ratio, maximum relative camber and maximum camber position were 2.0, 15.5% and 35.1%, respectively. Under the optimal conditions, the maximum lift coefficient was improved by 20.5% compared with the initial otter board. The relative error differed by only 1.6% from RSM model predictions, which indicated the availability of the model experimentally.																	0029-8018	1873-5258				JAN 15	2021	220								108475	10.1016/j.oceaneng.2020.108475							WOS:000607850200057

Salp samples were collected during the Lazarev Sea Krill Study in the western Weddell Sea (summer 2005-06 and 2007-08, autumn 2004 and winter 2006). Two salp species, Salpa thompsoni and Ihlea racovitzai, both occur in the Southern Ocean and can overlap geographically and seasonally. We provide evidence that, despite the non-selective feeding mechanism, the two co-occurring salp species might have different niches within a habitat. ARISA-patterns of 93 gut content samples revealed strong differences between the two salp species, even at the same sampling site. These differences were confirmed by 454-pyrosequencing of the V4-18S rDNA of ten salps. The pyrosequencing data indicate that flagellates, in particular dinophyceae, constitute a high proportion of the sequence reads identified in the gut content of both salp species. However, within the dinophyceae, differences in the read composition were detected between the two salp species. This supports the findings of a previous study where fatty acid signatures indicate a flagellate-based diet, even though microscopic analyses identified diatoms as the dominant component of salp gut contents.

Assessing the structure and temporal dynamics of seabird communities: the challenge of capturing marine ecosystem complexity	JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY												1. Understanding interspecific interactions, and the influences of anthropogenic disturbance and environmental change on communities, are key challenges in ecology. Despite the pressing need to understand these fundamental drivers of community structure and dynamics, only 17% of ecological studies conducted over the past three decades have been at the community level. 2. Here, we assess the trophic structure of the procellariiform community breeding at South Georgia, to identify the factors that determine foraging niches and possible temporal changes. We collected conventional diet data from 13 sympatric species between 1974 and 2002, and quantified intra-and inter-guild, and annual variation in diet between and within foraging habits. In addition, we tested the reliability of stable isotope analysis (SIA) of seabird feathers collected over a 13-year period, in relation to those of their potential prey, as a tool to assess community structure when diets are diverse and there is high spatial heterogeneity in environmental baselines. 3. Our results using conventional diet data identified a four-guild community structure, distinguishing species that mainly feed on crustaceans; large fish and squid; a mixture of crustaceans, small fish and squid; or carrion. In total, Antarctic krill Euphausia superba represented 32%, and 14 other species a further 46% of the combined diet of all 13 predators, underlining the reliance of this community on relatively few types of prey. Annual variation in trophic segregation depended on relative prey availability; however, our data did not provide evidence of changes in guild structure associated with a suggested decline in Antarctic krill abundance over the past 40 years. 4. Reflecting the differences in delta N-15 of potential prey (crustaceans vs. squid vs. fish and carrion), analysis of delta N-15 in chick feathers identified a three-guild community structure that was constant over a 13-year period, but lacked the trophic cluster representing giant petrels which was identified using conventional diet data. 5. Our study is the first in recent decades to examine dietary changes in seabird communities over time. Conventional dietary analysis provided better resolution of community structure than SIA. However, delta N-15 in chick feathers, which reflected trophic (level) specialization, was nevertheless an effective and less time-consuming means of monitoring temporal changes.

Euphausiid community structure and population structure of Euphausia superba off Adelie Land in the Southern Ocean during austral summer 2003, 2005 and 2008	POLAR SCIENCE												The distribution and community structure of euphausiids and the population structure of Euphausia superba were investigated mainly along 140 degrees E off Adelie Land in the Indian Ocean sector of the Southern Ocean during the austral summers of 2003, 2005 and 2008. Euphausiids were collected from six discrete depth layers, primarily between 0 and 2000 m, using an RMT 8 net. Euphausia frigida and Euphausia triacantha mainly occurred north of the Southern Boundary of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (SB) whereas E. superba was distributed south of the SB, and occurred abundantly in the continental slope area where Antarctic Winter Water was observed. E. frigida and E. triacantha occurred in the upper 200 m during the night whereas they were mainly found below 200 m during the daytime. Cluster analysis on stations suggested that the SB is an important biological boundary for euphausiid communities. The population structure of E. superba in 2003 was different from that of 2005 and 2008. While large mature individuals dominated in 2003, small immature krill (juveniles and subadult males) were more abundant in 2005 and 2008. Further sea-ice extension in the preceding winter in 2005 and 2008 likely provided favourable conditions for spawning and survival. A cluster analysis based on similarity of the maturity stages of E. superba revealed that mature males and gravid females (stage IIIC-E) were mainly distributed in the offshore area and mesopelagic zone, while juveniles and subadult males were found in the epipelagic zone of the continental slope area. Therefore, it is considered that E. superba migrates to the offshore area and mesopelagic zone as it grows. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. and NIPR. All rights reserved.

A detailed analysis of a summer integrated multi-trophic normalized biomass size spectra (NBSS), from heterotrophic bacteria to zooplankton, was carried out. To acquire individual size data, different techniques were combined: flow cytometry for smaller fractions (< 20 A mu m of equivalent spherical diameter), FlowCAM for larger nano- and microplankton and scanning and image analysis for the zooplankton fractions. The distribution of the NBSS was linear at all stations (R-2 values: 0.87-0.93) but dome-shape features appeared related to phytoplankton cell distribution which are responsible for a large fraction of microbial respiration. Generally, the region showed an autotrophic budget south of the archipelago due to gross primary production (GPP) values up to 2804 mg C m(-2) day(-1), where salps could significantly contribute to the carbon export flux. Contrastingly, higher CR rates (> 1000 mg C m(-2) day(-1)) were found at the northern stations due to a higher phytoplankton respiration activity associated with increasing sea water temperatures and a higher presence of heterotrophic organisms (microheterotrophs, chaetognaths and copepods) resulting in a net heterotrophic metabolic state (GPP/CR < 1).

However, sufficient information is seldom available at large spatial scales, particularly in polar areas. The Southern Ocean (SO) represents a critical habitat for various species, particularly migratory baleen whales. Still, the SO's remoteness and sea ice coverage disallow obtaining sufficient information on baleen whale distribution and niche preference. Here, we used presence-only species distribution models to predict the circumantarctic habitat suitability of baleen whales and identify important predictors affecting their distribution. Location: The Southern Ocean (SO). Methods: We used Maxent to model habitat suitability for Antarctic minke, Antarctic blue, fin and humpback whales. Our models employ extensive circumantarctic data and carefully prepared predictors describing the SO's environment and two spatial sampling bias correction options. Species-specific spatial-block cross-validation was used to optimize model complexity and for spatially independent model evaluation. Results: Model performance was high on cross-validation, with generally little predicted uncertainty. The most important predictors were derived from sea ice, particularly seasonal mean and variability of sea ice concentration and distance to the sea ice edge. Main conclusions: Our models support the usefulness of presence-only models as a cost-effective tool in the marine realm, particularly for studying the migratory whales' distribution. However, we found discrepancies between our results and (within) results of similar studies, mainly due to using different species data quality and quantity, different study area extent and methodological reasons. We further highlight the limitations of implementing static distribution models in the highly dynamic marine realm. Dynamic models, which relate species information to environmental conditions contemporaneous to species occurrences, can predict near-real-time habitat suitability, necessary for dynamic management. Nevertheless, obtaining sufficient species and environmental predictors at high spatio-temporal resolution, necessary for dynamic models, can be challenging from polar regions.

J	Pinkerton, MH; Bradford-Grieve, JM				Pinkerton, Matthew H.; Bradford-Grieve, Janet M.			Characterizing foodweb structure to identify potential ecosystem effects of fishing in the Ross Sea, Antarctica	ICES JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE												The potential ecosystem effects of fishing for Antarctic toothfish (Dissostichus mawsoni) in the Ross Sea region were investigated. Mixed trophic impact analysis was applied to a model of the Ross Sea foodweb and used to calculate the relative trophic importances of species and trophic groups in the system. The trophic impact of toothfish on medium-sized demersal fish was identified as the strongest top-down interaction in the system based on multiple-step analysis. This suggests a potential for a strong predation-release effect on some piscine prey of toothfish (especially grenadiers and ice-fish on the Ross Sea slope). However, Antarctic toothfish had moderate trophic importance in the Ross Sea foodweb as a whole, and the analysis did not support the hypothesis that changes to toothfish will cascade through the ecosystem by simple trophic effects. Because of limitations of this kind of analysis, cascading effects on the Ross Sea ecosystem due to changes in the abundance of toothfish cannot be ruled out, but for such changes to occur a mechanism other than simple trophic interactions is likely to be involved. Trophic importances were highest in the middle of the foodweb where silverfish and krill are known to have a key role in ecosystem structure and function. The six groups with the highest indices of trophic importance were (in decreasing order): phytoplankton, mesozooplankton, Antarctic silverfish, small demersal fish, Antarctic krill and cephalopods. Crystal krill and small pelagic fish also had high trophic importance in some analyses. Strengths and limitations of this kind of analysis are presented. In particular, it is noted that the analysis only considers trophic interactions at the spatial, temporal and ecological scale of the whole Ross Sea shelf and slope area, averaged over a typical year and in 35 trophic groups. Interference and density-dependent effects were not included in this analysis. Effects at smaller spatial and temporal scales, and effects concerning only parts of populations, were not resolved by the analysis, and this is likely to underestimate the potential risks of fishing to Weddell seals and type-C killer whales.

Marine Important Bird and Biodiversity Areas for Penguins in Antarctica, Targets for Conservation Action	FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE												Global targets for area-based conservation and management must move beyond threshold-based targets alone and must account for the quality of such areas. In the Southern Ocean around Antarctica, a region where key biodiversity faces unprecedented risks from climate change and where there is a growing demand to extract resources, a number of marine areas have been afforded enhanced conservation or management measures through two adopted marine protected areas (MPAs). However, evidence suggests that additional high quality areas could benefit from a proposed network of MPAs. Penguins offer a particular opportunity to identify high quality areas because these birds, as highly visible central-place foragers, are considered indicator species whose populations reflect the state of the surrounding marine environment. We compiled a comprehensive dataset of the location of penguin colonies and their associated abundance estimates in Antarctica. We then estimated the at-sea distribution of birds based on information derived from tracking data and through the application of a modified foraging radius approach with a density decay function to identify some of the most important marine areas for chick-rearing adult penguins throughout waters surrounding Antarctica following the Important Bird and Biodiversity Area (IBA) framework. Additionally, we assessed how marine IBAs overlapped with the currently adopted and proposed network of key management areas (primarily MPAs), and how the krill fishery likely overlapped with marine IBAs over the past five decades. We identified 63 marine IBAs throughout Antarctic waters and found that were the proposed MPAs to be adopted, the permanent conservation of high quality areas for penguin species would increase by between 49 and 100% depending on the species. Furthermore, our data show that, despite a generally contracting range of operation by the krill fishery in Antarctica over the past five decades, a consistently disproportionate amount of krill is being harvested within marine IBAs compared to the total area in which the fishery operates. Our results support the designation of the proposed MPA network and offer additional guidance as to where decision-makers should act before further perturbation occurs in the Antarctic marine ecosystem.				, Jefferson/AAG-1702-2021; Dias, Maria/AAK-1171-2021; Cardenas, Cesar/ABF-1664-2020; Franco, Aldina/G-2144-2010	, Jefferson/0000-0002-3600-1414; Dias, Maria/0000-0002-7281-4391; Rouyer, Marie-Morgane/0000-0003-4915-7191; Franco, Aldina/0000-0001-6055-7378; Cardenas, Cesar/0000-0001-6662-6899													2296-7745				JAN 20	2021	7								602972	10.3389/fmars.2020.602972							WOS:000612354800001						
J	Casaux, R				Casaux, R			The contrasting diet of Harpagifer antarcticus (Notothenioidei, Harpagiferidae) at two localities of the South Shetland Islands, Antarctica	POLAR BIOLOGY												The diet of Harpagifer antarcticus was studied at two localities of the South Shetland Islands, Antarctica. The analysis of the stomach contents of specimens collected in tide pools at Potter Cove, King George Island, indicated that gammarid amphipods (mainly Gondogeneia sp.) were the main prey of this fish, followed by polychaetes, gastropods and isopods. By contrast, the specimens from Harmony Point, Nelson Island, which were recovered from stomach contents of Antarctic shags Phalacrocorax bransfieldensis feeding at depths of 46-110 m, preyed almost exclusively on the Antarctic krill Euphausia superba. These results are discussed and compared with previous studies.																	0722-4060					APR	1998	19	4					283	285		10.1007/s003000050246							WOS:000072904600009						
J	Xavier, JC; Croxall, JP; Reid, K				Xavier, JC; Croxall, JP; Reid, K			Interannual variation in the diets of two albatross species breeding at South Georgia: implications for breeding performance	IBIS												The diet and breeding performance of Grey-headed Albatrosses Thalassarche chrysostoma and Black-browed Albatrosses Diomedea melanophris breeding at Bird Island, South Georgia, were studied simultaneously during the chick-rearing period between 1996 and 2000. When samples for all years were combined, cephalopods and crustaceans were the main components in the diet of Grey-headed and Black-browed Albatrosses, respectively. However, their diets exhibited interannual variations. Cephalopods were the most important component in the diet of Grey-headed Albatrosses between 1996 and 1999 (60-75% by mass) but decreased significantly in 2000 (17%), when crustaceans dominated (61%). The Black-browed Albatross diet varied greatly, with cephalopods being the most important component in 1996 (49% by mass) and 1997 (48%), fish in 1998 (32%) and 1999 (40%), and crustaceans in 2000 (63%). In 1998 and 2000 there was a significant change in the cephalopod species present in the diet of both albatross species, when their breeding success was low. The consumption of the ommastrephid Martialia hyadesi was significantly and positively correlated with Grey-headed Albatross breeding success. For Black-browed Albatrosses significant correlations were found between its consumption of the Icefish Champsocephalus gunnari and breeding success, and between its consumption of M. hyadesi and M. hyadesi CPUE (Catch per Unit Effort). These findings suggest that Grey-headed Albatrosses are more reliant on Antarctic Polar Frontal Zone prey (M. hyadesi and Lamprey Geotria australis) whereas Black-browed Albatrosses are more dependent on Antarctic prey (Icefish and Antarctic Krill Euphausia superba). The differences between diets of Grey-headed and Black-browed Albatrosses breeding on different islands of the Southern Ocean showed that Grey-headed Albatrosses feed more on oceanic cephalopods (e.g. M. hyadesi) whereas Black-browed Albatrosses feed primarily on shelf fish (e.g. Blue Whiting Micromesistius australis), suggesting that albatross diets are likely to be influenced by the geographical position of those islands, albatross foraging preference and prey availability.					/0000-0002-9621-6660												0019-1019					OCT	2003	145	4					593	610		10.1046/j.1474-919X.2003.00196.x							WOS:000185657700006

Data from two cruises conducted near the South Shetland Islands (SSIs) and the Elephant Island (EI), one in austral summer of 2004 and one in austral winter of 2006, were analyzed to provide a broad picture of the circulation pattern over the continental slope of the surveyed area, and an insight into the dynamical balance of the circulation. The results indicate that southwestward currents are present over the upper slope in the study area, indicating the ASC in the WAP region. Near the Shackleton Gap (SG) north of the EI, the southwestward slope currents near the shelf break are characterized by a water mass colder and fresher than the ambient water, which produces cross-slope density gradients and then vertical shear of the along-slope (or along-isobath) velocity. The vertical shear is associated with a reversal of the along-slope current from northeastward at surface to southwestward in deeper layers, or a depth-intensification of the southwestward slope currents. The water mass with temperature and salinity characteristics similar to the observed cold and fresh water is also revealed on the southern slope of the Scotia Sea, suggesting that this cold and fresh water is originated from the Scotia Sea slope and flows southwestward through the SG. Over the shelf north of the SSIs, the cold and fresh water mass is also observed and originates mainly from the Bransfield Strait. In this area, vertical structure of the southwestward slope currents is associated with the onshore intrusion of the upper Circumpolar Deep Water that creates cross-slope density gradients.																	1672-5182	1993-5021				APR	2018	17	2					420	432		10.1007/s11802-018-3353-9							WOS:000427906900023

Use of the Southern Ocean by breeding Short-tailed shearwaters (Puffinus tenuirostris)	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY												During the breeding season, seabirds act as central place foragers, constrained to foraging locations nearer to the breeding colony. Variability in energetic demands during phases of the breeding period has the capacity to shape foraging behaviour and influence at-sea foraging behaviour of seabirds due to the changing requirements of the young. Short-tailed shearwaters (Puffinus tenuirostris) (STSH) are a migratory species that migrates between foraging grounds in the northern Pacific Ocean and breeding colonies in south-east Australia. They are known to traverse large sectors of the Southern Ocean to find prey; however the at-sea foraging locations of this species are not spatially and temporally well defined during the breeding season, when energetic requirements are at their peak. We aimed to define key foraging areas of STSH over the pre-laying, incubation and chick-rearing phases of the breeding cycle and identify associations with broad scale oceanographic features. Using lightlevel geolocation archival tag technology, 27 adults from a southern Tasmanian colony were tracked from their arrival in October to March (2010-2011), providing information on a total of 77 pre-laying exodus, incubation and chick-rearing flights throughout the Southern Ocean. During the pre-laying exodus and incubation phases, the birds visited waters of the sub-Antarctic Front and Polar Frontal Zone. After hatching, the birds made direct flights to the Marginal Ice Zone between 155E and 90 E. The Antarctic pack ice is a key nursery ground for Antarctic krill (Euphasia superba) over the winter months, and as the ice retreats they become more accessible to STSH when energetic demands, due to chick provisioning, are at their greatest. During late chick-rearing, the birds used waters in the region of the Antarctic Divergence. A foraging index created from activity data collected by the tags indicated that adults spent the greatest amount of time foraging at the furthest extent of each trip. This study has shown that STSH alter their foraging movements over the course of the breeding season, using areas that are likely to provide predictable food resources. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

THE ROSS SEA IN A SEA OF CHANGE	OCEANOGRAPHY												The Ross Sea, the most productive region in the Antarctic, reaches farther south than any body of water in the world. While its food web is relatively intact, its oceanography, biogeochemistry, and sea ice coverage have been changing dramatically, and likely will continue to do so in the future. Sea ice cover and persistence have been increasing, in contrast to the Amundsen-Bellingshausen sector, which has resulted in reduced open water duration for its biota. Models predict that as the ozone hole recovers, ice cover will begin to diminish. Currents on the continental shelf will likely change in the coming century, with a projected intensification of flow leading to altered deep ocean ventilation. Such changes in ice and circulation will lead to altered plankton distributions and composition, but it is difficult at present to predict the nature of these changes. Iron and irradiance play central roles in regulating phytoplankton production in the Ross Sea, but the impacts of oceanographic changes on the biogeochemistry of iron are unclear. Unlike other Southern Ocean regions, where continental shelves are very narrow and Antarctic krill dominates the herbivorous fauna, the broad shelf of the Ross Sea is dominated by crystal krill and silverfish, which are the major prey items for higher trophic levels. At present, the Ross Sea is considered to be one of the most species-rich areas of the Southern Ocean and a biodiversity "hotspot" due to its heterogeneous habitats. Despite being among the best-studied regions in the entire Southern Ocean, accurate predictions of the impacts of climate change on the oceanography and ecology of the Ross Sea remain fraught with uncertainty.

Diving in the first 11 days was exclusively diurnal, averaging 244 dives on trips lasting 12 hours. Near the end of the brooding period trips were longer and included diving at night. About half of all trips (except those involving continuous night-time diving) was spent in diving and dive rate averaged 14-25 dives per hour (42 per hour at night). The duration of daytime dives varied between trips, and averaged 1.4-1.7 min, with a subsequent surface interval of 0.5-0.9 min. Dive duration was significantly directly related to depth, the latter accounting for 53% of the variation. The average depths of daytime dives were 20-35 m (maximum depth 115 m). Dives at night were shorter (average duration 0.9 min) and much shallower (maximum 11 m); depth accounted for only 6% of the variation in duration. Estimates of potential prey capture rates (3-5 krill per dive; one krill every 17-20 s) are made. Daily weight changes in chicks were directly related to number of dives, but not to foraging trip duration nor time spent diving. Of the other species at the same site which live by diving to catch krill, gentoo penguins forage exclusively diurnally, making longer, deeper dives; Antarctic fur seals, which dive to similar depths as macaroni penguins, do so mainly at night.

Distribution and abundance of marine microbes in the Southern Ocean between 30 and 80 degrees E	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY												Our study, as part of the Baseline Research on Oceanography, Krill and the Environment, West (BROKE-West) survey, emphasised the vital role of sea-ice retreat and upwelling in controlling the distribution, abundance and composition of marine microbial communities in the seasonal ice zone (SIZ). Autofluorescence or stains were used to detect the abundance of nanophytoplankton, heterotrophic nanoflagellates (HNF), virus like particles (VLP) and bacteria by flow cytometry. Correlations among microbial concentrations were determined and cluster analysis was performed to group sites of similar microbial composition and abundance. Distance to sea ice was the primary determinant of nanophytoplankton abundance and nanophytoplankton contributed up to 84% of the phytoplankton carbon biomass where melting sea ice caused shallow summer mixed layer depths. To the north, nanophytoplankton abundance was generally low except adjacent to the Southern Boundary (SB). HNF and bacterial abundance was positively correlated with the abundance of nanophytoplankton. Cluster analysis identified 5 groups of sites over the BROKE-West survey area. Clusters 1-4 grouped sites of different successional maturity of the microbial community along the continuum between bloom formation and senescence. Maturity increased with distance from the sea ice and, in areas of upwelling, with time since the development of phytoplankton blooms. Sites in cluster 5 occurred at the northernmost extreme of the survey area and were typical of communities in high nutrient low chlorophyll (HNLC) waters of the permanent open-ocean zone (POOZ) where phytoplankton growth was matched by mortality and decomposition. Synoptic-scale studies in Antarctic waters are rare but provide vital information about the control of microbial productivity, abundance and distribution in the Southern Ocean. Our study, covering over 40% of the SIZ off East Antarctica, enhances our understanding of the synoptic-scale factors that determine the structure and function of the microbial loop.

J	Garibotti, IA; Vernet, M; Smith, RC; Ferrario, ME				Garibotti, IA; Vernet, M; Smith, RC; Ferrario, ME			Interannual variability in the distribution of the phytoplankton standing stock across the seasonal sea-ice zone west of the Antarctic Peninsula	JOURNAL OF PLANKTON RESEARCH												The spatial distribution of phytoplankton cell abundance, carbon (C) biomass and chlorophyll a (Chl a) concentration was analysed during three summers (1996, 1997 and 1999) in a seasonal sea-ice area, west of the Antarctic Peninsula. The objective of the study was to assess interannual variability in phytoplankton spatial distribution and the mechanisms that regulate phytoplankton accumulation in the water column. Phytoplankton C biomass and Chl a distributions were consistent from year to year, exhibiting a negative on/offshore gradient. The variations in C concentration had a close and non-linear relationship with the upper mixed layer depth, suggesting that the vertical mixing of the water column is the main factor regulating phytoplankton stock. The magnitude of C gradients was 5-fold higher during 1996 than during 1997 and 1999. This was ascribed to interannual variations in the concentration of diatom blooms in the region influenced by sea-ice melting. Vertical distribution of the phytoplankton, as estimated from Chl a profiles, also varied along an on/offshore gradient: Chl a was distributed homogeneously in the upper mixed layer in coastal and mid-shelf stations and concentrated in the deep layer (40-100 m) occupied by the winter waters (WW, remnants of the Antarctic surface waters during summer) in more offshore stations. The region with a deep Chl a maximum layer (DCM layer) was dominated by a phytoplankton assemblage characterized by a relatively high concentration of diatoms. The extent of this region varied from year to year: it was restricted to pelagic waters during 1996, extended to the shelf slope during 1997 and occupied a major portion of the area during 1999. It is hypothesized that iron depletion in near surface waters due to phytoplankton consumption, and a higher concentration in WW, regulated this vertical phytoplankton distribution pattern. Furthermore, we postulate that year-to-year variations in the spatial distribution of the DCM layer were related to interannual variations in the timing of the sea-ice retreat. The similarity between our results and those reported in literature for other areas of the Southern Ocean allows us to suggest that the mechanisms proposed here as regulating phytoplankton stock in our area may be applicable elsewhere.																	0142-7873	1464-3774				AUG	2005	27	8					825	843		10.1093/plankt/fbi056							WOS:000232593000010

Nearest neighbour cluster analysis of phytoplankton and zooplankton data sets indicated the presence of 3 major station groupings within each analysis that collectively had great geographic integrity. Thus a shelf station group was characterised by low phytoplankton biomass and primary production rates (median values 69 mg chl a m(-2); 418 mg C m(-2) d(-1), respectively) and a dominance of nano- and pico-phytoplankton, on the one hand, and low overall mesozooplankton levels (median 50,135 ind. m(-2)), which was also coincident with elevated krill biomass, on the other. At the western end of the island high mesozooplankton abundance (median > 250,000 ind. m(-2)) in oceanic waters was co-incident with a phytoplankton bloom that originated over the North West Georgia Rise (NWGR). These 'bloom' stations were characterised by high phytoplankton biomass and primary production rates (median 218 mg m(-2) and 916 mg C m(-2) d(-1), respectively) and were dominated by microphytoplankton. This elevated production was associated with an anticyclonic eddy which was considered to have been initiated where the Southern Antarctic Circumpolar Current Front (SACCF) interacted with the bathymetry of the NWGR. SeaWiFS and drifter buoy data indicated that this production was subsequently entrained and transported cyclonically around the Georgia Basin downstream from the island. In contrast, at the eastern end of the island, in waters south of the SACCF, phytoplankton biomass and primary production rates were lower (median 40 mg m(-2) and 214 mg C m(-2) d(-1), respectively) although median zooplankton abundance was intermediate (similar to 157,000 ind. m(-2)). Of the environmental variables measured in this study the proportion of microphytoplankton within samples, rather than for example, phytoplankton biomass, explained the greatest proportion of the variance associated with the carbon mass of individual copepod species stages, egg production rates and total zooplankton abundance. We conclude that stations in the western and eastern oceanic regions were dominated by bottom up controls, with physical forcing and adequate nutrient availability leading to bloom conditions of large diatoms in the west, whereas in the east, phytoplankton growth was lower (possibly due to micronutrient limitation) and zooplankton abundance was lower. Over the shelf we suggest that a higher average biomass of krill (similar to 80 g wet mass m(-2)) compared to offshelf (43 g wet mass m(-2)) may have exerted top down control and grazed out chl a and thus have been responsible for low mesozooplankton abundance.

J	Amos, AF				Amos, AF			A decade of oceanographic variability in summertime near Elephant Island, Antarctica	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS												The oceanography of near-surface (to 750 m) summertime waters surrounding the Elephant Island area of the South Shetland Islands has been surveyed each year from 1990 to 1999 as part of the U.S. Antarctic Marine Living Resources (AMLR) program. Using data from a grid of conductivity-temperature-depth stations occupied twice each summer and surface meteorological data collected continuously in the survey area, the mean (and annual departures from the mean) hydrography, circulation, and overlying wind field have been determined. The area is an important krill fishing ground and includes several water mass zones and a major frontal boundary. Differences between middle and late summer ("seasonal") conditions and interannual variability have been investigated. The mean summer condition is quite representative of conditions encountered in each of the 10 years, and little change occurs from middle to late summer, other than a warming of Antarctic Surface Water, including the Winter Water temperature minimum at 100 m, but there is no discernible trend from middle to late summer at the depth of the Circumpolar Deep Water. Interannual variability of sea temperature, winds, and sea level pressure as measured during these surveys showed no correlation with a sea ice index and a recently devised pressure index, the Drake Passage Oscillation Index (DPOI) [Naganobu et al., 1999], despite the correlations found in that study between AMLR chlorophyll a and krill recruitment indices, sea ice, and the DPOI. No correlation was found between DPOI and annual summertime sea temperature, wind, and surface pressure anomalies in the survey area. The implication is that global-scale climatic oscillations with periodicities measured in years may not be adequately detected by small-scale oceanographic surveys even though the surveys may extend over several years unless the surveys are specifically designed for that purpose.																	2169-9275	2169-9291				OCT 15	2001	106	C10					22401	22423		10.1029/2000JC000315							WOS:000171468300021

Temporal variation in trophic relationships among three congeneric penguin species breeding in sympatry	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION												Penguins are a monophyletic group in which many species are found breeding sympatrically, raising questions regarding how these species coexist successfully. Here, the isotopic niche of three sympatric pygoscelid penguin species was investigated at Powell Island, South Orkney Islands, during two breeding seasons (austral summers 2013-2014 and 2015-2016). Measurements of carbon (C-13) and nitrogen (N-15) stable isotope ratios were obtained from blood (adults) or feather (chicks) samples collected from Adelie Pygoscelis adeliae, chinstrap P.antarctica, and gentoo P.papua penguins. Isotopic niche regions (a proxy for the realized trophic niches) were computed to provide estimates of the trophic niche width of the studied species during the breeding season. The isotopic niche regions of adults of all three species were similar, but gentoo chicks had noticeably wider isotopic niches than the chicks of the other two species. Moderate to strong overlap in isotopic niche among species was found during each breeding season and for both age groups, suggesting that the potential for competition for shared food sources was similar during the two study years, although the actual level of competition could not be determined owing to the lack of data on resource abundance. Clear interannual shifts in isotopic niche were seen in all three species, though of lower amplitude for adult chinstrap penguins. These shifts were due to variation in carbon, but not nitrogen, isotopic ratios, which could indicate either a change in isotopic signature of their prey or a switch to an alternative food web. The main conclusions of this study are that (1) there is a partial overlap in the isotopic niches of these three congeneric species and that (2) they responded similarly to changes that likely occurred at the base of their food chain between the 2years of the study.

J	Jenouvrier, S; Barbraud, C; Weimerskirch, H				Jenouvrier, S; Barbraud, C; Weimerskirch, H			Effects of climate variability on the temporal population dynamics of southern fulmars	JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY												1. Ecological and population processes are affected by large-scale climatic fluctuations, and top predators such as seabirds can provide an integrative view on the consequences of environmental variability on ecosystems. Here, we examine the dynamics of a southern fulmar population in Antarctica over a 39-year period and evaluate the impact of environmental variability on the life history traits of this top predator species. 2. Between 1963 and 2002, the number of breeding pairs fluctuated between seven and 53 in relation to variations in sea ice concentration, and increased overall (annual growth rate: 1.0035). Breeding performance tended to be lower in years with low sea ice concentration. The proportion of birds attempting to breed varied strongly from one year to the next despite the birds were alive, indicating strong environmental forcing on the decision to breed. The number of new local recruits and immigrants was correlated highly with the number of local breeders, and capture probabilities were positively related to the breeding population size. Local recruitment, number of local breeders and proportion of birds attempting to breed were lower when sea ice concentration during summer was low. 3. Adult survival between 1964 and 2002 was on average 0.923 +/- 0.006, and decreased during years with high sea surface temperature and low sea ice concentration. 4. Modelled population growth rate, estimated using matrix models, of the population was 0.9728, a difference of 3.6% compared to the observed rate of increase. This discrepancy is due probably to the immigration rate (3 +/- 3%). 5. Demographic parameters were affected by sea ice concentration and sea surface temperature anomalies, probably through an impact on krill availability, the main prey of southern fulmars. During warm anomalies, birds skip breeding probably because the food availability was low and limiting for the highly energy demanding reproductive activities. 6. We also emphasize that demographic parameters were very low during the period 1975-80 and showed a higher variability after 1980, which could be interpreted in the context of a regime shift. Our study indicates that the southern fulmar population dynamics may be very susceptible to environmental variability. Further long-lasting warm anomalies are likely to affect negatively their populations.

Population dynamics and production of Themisto gaudichaudii (Amphipoda, Hyperiidae) at South Georgia, Antarctica	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY												The population dynamics, individual growth rates and productivity of the hyperiid amphipod Themisto gaudichaudii were studied in Cumberland Bay, a fjord on the north-eastern coast of South Georgia. The study involved the weekly sampling of the population and its potential food with a Rectangular Midwater Trawl (RMT1) at weekly intervals between May 2005 and October 2006. Offshore samples were taken the previous austral summer using an RMT8 net. T. gaudichaudii produced one main cohort in the spring (September/October) and a secondary weaker cohort in the late summer (January/February). The main cohort appeared at the time of phytoplankton increase, about 3 weeks before an increase in mesozooplankton. Larger individuals (20-25 mm) resided offshore but not within the Bay during the main recruitment period. T. gaudichaudii grew at an average rate of 0.1 mm d(-1) during the first four months after release and then by 0.07 mm d(-1) for the subsequent four months. At these rates, it is possible that the main cohort reaches reproductive size in time to spawn the autumn cohort, although the relative weakness of the autumn cohort suggests that few manage this. T. gaudichaudii biomass reached its highest levels in November at a mean value of 5.4 mg DW m(-3) while daily production was also highest in November at a mean value of 0.17 mg DW m(-3) d(-1). The P/B d(-1) ratio varied between 0.03 d(-1) in the summer to below 0.01 d(-1) in the winter. Daily mortality rate was initially 0.12 d(-1) during the first two months post-recruitment, falling to 0.03 d(-1) for the remainder of the year. Integrating production over the year gave a value of 10.04 mg DW y(-1), equivalent to 3.62 mg C m(-3) y(-1), making T. gaudichaudii a relatively productive component of the pelagic community. During the summer, the species was estimated to consume around 1-2% of available mesozooplankton biomass and a mean of 15% of mesozooplankton daily productivity. T. gaudichaudii may have a controlling influence on mesozooplankton dynamics as well as on the recruitment of the larval stages of important commercially fished species such as Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) and Mackerel icefish (Champsocephalus gunnari).

Two species, Gymnoscopelus braueri and Krefftichthyes anderssoni were lipid-rich (406-456 mg g(-1) dry weight whole fish) with wax esters (WE) the major lipid class. In three species, G. opisthopterus, G. nicholsi, and Electrona carlsbergii, triacylglycerols (TAG) were the major lipid. All fish had oily bones, with values up to 471 mg g(-1) dry weight: in the vertebral centra of K. anderssoni. The principal fatty acids of the TAG-rich myctophids included the monoenes 18:1(n-9) and 20:1. There were lower levels of 16:0 and 18:0 saturated fatty acids. Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) were present at higher abundance in the TAG-rich E. carlsbergii and G, opisthopterus, with lower levels in G. nicholsi. In comparison, the WE-dominated species contained lower levels of PUFA than in the TAG-rich species. The principal fatty acids of the WE-rich myctophids included the monoenes 18: 1(n-9), 16: 1(n-7), and 18:1(n-7), with lower levels of the saturated acids 16:0 and 18:0. Fatty alcohols were dominated by 16:0 and 14:0 and the monounsaturated 18:1(n-9) with 16:1(n-7), 18:1(n-7), and 20:1(n-9). Based on the fatty acid profiles, the diet of G. opisthopterus and G. nicholsi, previously thought to be mainly Euphausia superba, is suggested to include copepods and other zooplankton with only a minor krill component, possibly consisting of other species than E. superba.

J	Potvin, J; Goldbogen, JA; Shadwick, RE				Potvin, J.; Goldbogen, J. A.; Shadwick, R. E.			Scaling of lunge feeding in rorqual whales: An integrated model of engulfment duration	JOURNAL OF THEORETICAL BIOLOGY												Rorqual whales (Balaenopteridae) obtain their food by lunge feeding, a dynamic process that involves the intermittent engulfment and filtering of large amounts of water and prey. During a lunge, whales accelerate to high speed and open their mouth wide, thereby exposing a highly distensible buccal cavity to the flow and facilitating its inflation. Unsteady hydrodynamic models suggest that the muscles associated with the ventral groove blubber undergo eccentric contraction in order to stiffen and control the inflation of the buccal cavity; in doing so the engulfed water mass is accelerated forward as the whale's body slows down. Although the basic mechanics of lunge feeding are relatively well known, the scaling of this process remains poorly understood, particularly with regards to its duration (from mouth opening to closure). Here we formulate a new theory of engulfment time which integrates prey escape behavior with the mechanics of the whale's body, including lunge speed and acceleration, gape angle dynamics, and the controlled inflation of the buccal cavity. Given that the complex interaction between these factors must be highly coordinated in order to maximize engulfment volume, the proposed formulation rests on the scenario of Synchronized Engulfment, whereby the filling of the cavity (posterior to the temporomandibular joint) coincides with the moment of maximum gape. When formulated specifically for large rorquals feeding on krill, our analysis predicts that engulfment time increases with body size, but in amounts dictated by the specifics of krill escape and avoidance kinematics. The predictions generated by the model are corroborated by limited empirical data on a species-specific basis, particularly for humpback and blue whales chasing krill. A sensitivity analysis applied to all possible sized fin whales also suggests that engulfment duration and lunge speed will increase intra-specifically with body size under a wide range of predator-prey scenarios. This study provides the theoretical framework required to estimate the scaling of the mass-specific drag being generated during engulfment, as well as the energy expenditures incurred.

Here, we present the first evidence that climate fluctuations affect the vertical migration of zooplankton in the Southern Ocean, based on multi-year acoustic backscatter data from one of the deep troughs in the Amundsen Sea, Antarctica. High net primary productivity (NPP) and the annual variation in seasonal ice cover make the Amundsen Sea coastal polynya an ideal site in which to examine how zooplankton behavior responds to climate fluctuations. Our observations show that the timing of the seasonal vertical migration and abundance of zooplankton in the seasonally varying sea ice is correlated with the Southern Annular Mode (SAM) and El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO). Zooplankton in this region migrate seasonally and overwinter at depth, returning to the surface in spring. During +SAM/La Nina periods, the at-depth overwintering period is shorter compared to -SAM/El Nino periods, and return to the surface layers starts earlier in the year. These differences may result from the higher sea ice cover and decreased NPP during +SAM/La Nina periods. This observation points to a new link between global climate fluctuations and the polar marine food web.

J	Bathmann, UV				Bathmann, UV			Ecology and biogeochemistry in the Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean during austral spring: the first JGOFS expedition aboard RV 'Polarstern'	JOURNAL OF MARINE SYSTEMS					International JGOFS Symposium on Carbon Fluxes and Dynamic Processes in the Southern Ocean - Present and Past	AUG 28-31, 1995	BREST, FRANCE	European Inst Marine Studies, Univ W Brittany				Investigations of phytoplankton spring bloom development and its biogeochemical impacts in different water masses of the Atlantic sector of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current were carried out during RV 'Polarstern' cruise ANT X/6 as part of the international Southern Ocean JGOFS programme. The regions investigated were the Polar Front region, the southern branch of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (sACC) and the Marginal Ice Zone (MIZ), between 48 degrees S and 60 degrees S along the 6 degrees W meridian from 29 September to 30 November 1992. This paper summarises the major findings of the cruise and complements the paper of Smetacek et al. [Smetacek, V., Bathmann, U.V., de Baar, H.J.W., Lochte K., Rutgers van der Loeff, M.M., 1997a.

Ecology and Biogeochemistry of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current During Austral Spring: Southern Ocean JGOFS Cruise ANT X/6 of R.V. 'Polarstern'. Deep-Sea Res. II, 44, 519 pp.]. In the surface waters of all regions a recycling community with low biomass but high turnover rates was present. This had Little impact on large scale biogeochemical cycles. Superimposed on this community were diatom blooms formed by large species in the region of the Polar Front. It was these massive diatom blooms that caused biogeochemical export to the deep ocean. Physical stability of the upper water layers was recognized as the most important factor in determining initiation and development of these blooms. Their growth was favoured by relatively high natural iron availability. Intrinsic factors in diatom life cycle and reproduction may have triggered the demise of blooms accompanied by massive sedimentation events. Feeding by larger zooplankton in general appeared minimal, except for the occurrence of salps in the low productivity zone of the sACC. Seasonal warming and ice-retreat in the sACC and MIZ caused outgassing of carbon dioxide, but there was clear CO2 draw-down by the diatom blooms in the iron-rich Polar Frontal region. Top predators had negligible direct impact on the CO2 budget but would have affected population dynamics of the plankton community. Thus, it was not the community with the highest turnover rates (microbial network) but the species which yielded most biomass (diatoms) which had the greatest impact on export of C, N and Si in this part of the Southern Ocean, and is therefore most important on biogeochemical cycling on global scales.																	0924-7963					NOV	1998	17	1-4					77	85		10.1016/S0924-7963(98)00030-X							WOS:000077463500006						
J	Guerrero, AI; Rogers, TL				Guerrero, A. I.; Rogers, T. L.			Blubber fatty acid composition and stratification in the crabeater seal, Lobodon carcinophaga	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY												The study of blubber fatty acids (FAs) has attracted increasing scientific interest due mainly to its potential use as trophic markers. This is possible because most FAs are transferred unmodified from the prey to the blubber of the predator. Additionally, FAs have also been used to understand other aspects of the biology of marine mammals, including thermoregulation and reproductive stage. The aim of this study is to determine the FA composition of the blubber of the crabeater seal, which has not been reported before, and identify stratification of FAs across the blubber layer. Seals were captured in the western Antarctic Peninsula during the austral summer of 2015 and a whole blubber core (down to the muscle layer) sample was collected. The blubber core was sub-sectioned into inner and outer layers and analysed for FAs. The FA composition of crabeater seals was similar to other marine mammals, with high proportions of 18:1 omega 9, 16:1 omega 7, and 16:0. These FAs are endogenous, that is, they can be readily synthesised by mammals. However, the high proportions of 22:6 omega 3 and 20:5 omega 3 are unusual among other marine mammals. These FAs are potentially reflecting the diet of crabeater seals, as they have a dietary origin and are known to be abundant in krill, the main prey item of this predator. Inner and outer layers were significantly different indicating a stratification of blubber FAs. The pattern of stratification is ubiquitous in marine mammals, with monounsaturated FAs increasing towards the outer layer, and saturated and polyunsaturated FAs increasing towards the inner layer. This difference between inner and outer layers may indicate that they have different metabolic roles. Because most dietary FAs were more abundant in the inner layer, this is likely to be the section where the dietary process takes place. The higher proportions of monounsaturated FAs in the outer layer suggest that this section of the blubber plays a more functional role, probably related to thermoregulation, as these FAs prevent rigidity and improve fluidity, which is particularly important in cold environments.

Divergent responses of Pygoscelis penguins reveal a common environmental driver	OECOLOGIA												The responses of predators to environmental variability in the Antarctic Peninsula region have exhibited divergent patterns owing to variation in the geographic settings of colonies and predator life-history strategies. Five breeding colonies of Pygoscelis penguins from King George Island and Livingston Island, South Shetland Islands, Antarctica, were examined to (1) compare the responses of sympatric congeners to recent changes in their Antarctic ecosystem and (2) assess underlying causes for such responses. We used linear regression and correlation analyses to compare indices of abundance, recruitment, and summer breeding performance of the Adelie (P. adeliae), gentoo (P. papua), and chinstrap penguins (P. antarctica). Breeding colonies of Adelie and chinstrap penguins have declined by roughly 50% since the mid-1970s, and recruitment indices of Adelie penguins have declined by roughly 80%, but no such patterns are evident for gentoo penguins. Fledging success, however, has remained stable at all breeding colonies. The different trends in abundance and recruitment indices for each species, despite generally similar indices of summer performance, suggest that winter conditions contribute to the divergent responses among the penguins. In particular, strong correlations between indices of penguin and krill recruitment suggest that penguins in the South Shetland Islands may live under an increasingly krill-limited system that has disproportionate effects on the survival of juvenile birds.				, Jefferson/AAG-1702-2021	, Jefferson/0000-0002-3600-1414												0029-8549					OCT	2007	153	4					845	855		10.1007/s00442-007-0781-4							WOS:000249407000006	17566778

In this study, we analyzed two millennial-scale ornithogenic sediment cores, RNL and RL, from the Vestfold Hills, East Antarctica. Using the Al-normalized phosphorus content of the bulk sediment and carbon/nitrogen fractions in penguin remains, we reconstructed relative changes in the penguin population size of each sub-colony and relative krill abundance in the summer Prydz Bay polynya. Both records are correlated to solar irradiance. At the centennial scale, the penguin population recorded in core RNL decreased from similar to 1120-860 yr BP, reached a peak from similar to 860-630 yr BP, remained at a low level from similar to 630-320 yr BP, and then increased with large fluctuations during the past similar to 400 years. These changes are all in-phase with the trend of solar irradiance. At the decadal scale, penguin population minima correspond to solar minima from similar to 490-400 yr BP (Sporer minimum), similar to 290-220 yr BP (Maunder minimum), and from similar to 160-120 yr BP (Dalton minimum; whereas population maxima correspond to solar maxima from similar to 1030-980 yr BP, similar to 350-290 yr BP, similar to 210-160 yr BP, similar to 120-70 yr BP. The population recorded in core RL exhibited the same changes as in RNL during the last 480 years. The reconstructed krill abundance also corresponds to these trends when data are available. This correspondence demonstrates a food-chain mechanism that is related to solar activity and light availability at the ocean surface, which influence the intensity of photosynthesis and phytoplankton productivity, and thus the abundance of krill and apex predators such as penguins. Our findings highlight the fact that despite the various climatic impacts on penguin populations, their effects on the base of the food chain are usually the direct drive.				xie, zhouqing/P-9661-2019													0031-0182	1872-616X				FEB 15	2019	516						220	231		10.1016/j.palaeo.2018.11.027							WOS:000456903000019

Each 24 h (for 72 h) numbers of saprophytic (Colony Forming Units, CFU), chitinolytic, and total bacteria (Acridine Orange Direct Count, AODC), were determined in the stomachs and hepatopancreata of animals. Parallely, the activities of chitinase, N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase (NAGase), protease, cellulase and laminarinase were measured, and bacterial and endogenous chitinases compared by Fast Protein Liquid Chromatography (FPLC). CFU in ''C'' group stomachs were stable, but varied widely in the ''A'' group. AODC did not vary to any great extent. Hepatopancreas CFU decreased by four orders in the ''A'' compared to the ''C'' group. In ''C'' hepatopancreata, AODC were slighly higher than in ''A''. Numbers of chitinolytic bacteria fell steeply in the ''A'' group. Chitinase, NAGase, protease, and cellulase activities in the stomach were significantly lower (5% level) after 24 h in ''A'' than in ''C''. Laminarinase activity was significantly reduced in both organs after 72 h. Hepatopancreas chitinase and protease activities showed significant reductions only after 24 h. FPLC elution profiles of NAGase from krill, and bacteria grown on a medium semi-selective for chitinolytic bacteria differed. A number of bacterial chitinase peaks were absent in the ''A'' group. The API Zym system showed reduced proteolytic and lipase (C14) activity over 72 h. Endogenous bacteria are considered commensal with respect to the enzymes discussed.

By the use of an ion-selective electrode, the fluoride concentration in these samples were found to be higher than that normally occurring in any mammalian species, ranging from 4340 to 18 570 ppm. The positive correlation observed with age, along with high fluoride concentrations found in krill taken from the stomachs of these whales, indicated a probable bioaccumulation of fluoride from dietary sources. These results confirmed and extended earlier findings that bone tissue in fin whales naturally contains very high concentrations of fluoride and indicate that this baleen whale is tolerant to a significant extent of the high fluoride concentrations found in krill.																	0141-1136						1991	31	3					241	247		10.1016/0141-1136(91)90014-Y							WOS:A1991GL08900006

The biogeochemical cycle of mercury in the remote Antarctic region is still poorly understood, with Polar climate change contributing added complexity. Longitudinal biomonitoring of mercury accumulation in Antarctic marine megafauna can contribute top-down insight into the bio-physical drivers of wildlife exposure. The bioaccumulative nature of organic mercury renders high trophic predators at the greatest risk of elevated exposure. Humpback whales represent secondary consumers of the Antarctic sea-ice ecosystem and an ideal biomonitoring species for persistent and bioaccumulative compounds due to their extended life-spans. This study provides the first results of mercury accumulation in humpback whales, and places findings within the context of mercury accumulation in both prey, as well as six other species of Antarctic marine megafauna.

Because considerable uncertainty surrounds recent estimates of stock size, there is a need to consider novel approaches that may give insight into the population dynamics of this species. We derive two indices of recruitment based on the occurrence of mackerel icefish in gentoo penguin diets, one of which is scaled by a survey estimate of the density of Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba), an alternative prey species for gentoo penguins. The closure of the fishery for much of the 1990s allowed the relationship between environmental conditions and recruitment to be studied without the confounding effects of fishing mortality. The recruitment indices were positively correlated with sea surface temperature with a lag time equal to the age of the fish. These results suggest strong links between mesoscale environmental processes and the smaller scale interaction between gentoo penguins and their mackerel icefish prey.

Whisker isotopic signature depicts migration patterns and multi-year intra- and inter-individual foraging strategies in fur seals	BIOLOGY LETTERS												The movement and dietary history of individuals can be studied using stable isotope records in archival keratinous tissues. Here, we present a chronology of temporally fine-scale data on the trophic niche of otariid seals by measuring the isotopic signature of serially sampled whiskers. Whiskers of male Antarctic fur seals breeding at the Crozet Islands showed synchronous and regular oscillations in both their delta(13)C and delta(15)N values that are likely to represent their annual migrations over the long term (mean 4.8 years). At the population level, male Antarctic fur seals showed substantial variation in both delta(13)C and delta(15)N values, occupying nearly all the 'isotopic space' created by the diversity of potential oceanic habitats (from high Antarctica to the subtropics) and prey (from Antarctic krill to sub-antarctic and subtropical mesopelagic fishes). At the individual level, whisker isotopic signatures depict a large diversity of foraging strategies. Some seals remained in either subantarctic or Antarctic waters, while the migratory cycle of most animals encompassed a wide latitudinal gradient where they fed on different prey. The isotopic signature of whiskers, therefore, revealed new multi-year foraging strategies of male Antarctic fur seals and is a powerful tool for investigating the ecological niche during cryptic stages of mammals' life.

The albatrosses foraged mostly over oceanic waters, probably associated with the Polar Front north of South Georgia, and also over shelf-slope waters around the Antarctic Peninsula. After leaving the colony, birds commuted to areas with predictable prey concentrations, where they remained for several days. During search periods, birds landed more often and had a higher intake rate, but spent the same proportion of time in flight as on commuting days. Although intake rates were particularly high in shelf-break waters around the Antarctic Peninsula (only one individual foraged in this area), prey were also consumed in reasonable quantities during commuting flights. While at sea, birds spent most (81%) of the day flying, and most (94%) of the night resting on the water. A considerable proportion (26% by mass) of prey was consumed during darkness. The majority of prey were detected and captured during search flights, but 35% were located while sitting on the sea surface. Many ingestion events (up to 27% of the overall food intake) showed temperature signatures characteristic of fluids, suggesting that albatrosses may feed on gelatinous and rapidly digested prey (e.g. salps and jellyfish) much more often than previously suspected. Diet samples delivered to the chicks comprised mostly squid (particularly Martialia hyadesi) and Antarctic krill Euphausia superba.

Environmental forcing and Southern Ocean marine predator populations: effects of climate change and variability	PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES												The Southern Ocean is a major component within the global ocean and climate system and potentially the location where the most rapid climate change is most likely to happen, particularly in the high-latitude polar regions. In these regions, even small temperature changes can potentially lead to major environmental perturbations. Climate change is likely to be regional and may be expressed in various ways, including alterations to climate and weather patterns across a variety of time-scales that include changes to the long interdecadal background signals such as the development of the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). Oscillating climate signals such as ENSO potentially provide a unique opportunity to explore how biological communities respond to change. This approach is based on the premise that biological responses to shorter-term sub-decadal climate variability signals are potentially the best predictor of biological responses over longer time-scales. Around the Southern Ocean, marine predator populations show periodicity in breeding performance and productivity, with relationships with the environment driven by physical forcing from the ENSO region in the Pacific. Wherever examined, these relationships are congruent with mid-trophic-level processes that are also correlated with environmental variability. The short-term changes to ecosystem structure and function observed during ENSO events herald potential long-term changes that may ensue following regional climate change. For example, in the South Atlantic, failure of Antarctic krill recruitment will inevitably foreshadow recruitment failures in a range of higher trophic-level marine predators. Where predator species are not able to accommodate by switching to other prey species, population-level changes will follow. The Southern Ocean, though oceano-graphically interconnected, is not a single ecosystem and different areas are dominated by different food webs. Where species occupy different positions in different regional food webs, there is the potential to make predictions about future change scenarios.																	0962-8436	1471-2970				DEC 29	2007	362	1488					2351	2365		10.1098/rstb.2006.1953							WOS:000250644100011	17553770

Proximate and elemental composition	MARINE BIOLOGY												Detailed determination of Salpa thompsoni elemental composition has been carried out on specimens collected in the Eastern Bellingshausen Sea and at the northern edge of the Weddell Gyre during austral autumn (April and May) of 1996 and 2001. More than 170 Antarctic tunicates S. thompsoni were analysed to determine wet weight (WW), dry weight (DW), ash-free dry weight (AFDW) and elemental composition (C, N content, proteins, carbohydrates and lipids) of different sizes and stages. Dry weight comprised 6.4% (aggregate form) to 7.7% (solitary form) of the WW. AFDW amounted to similar to 44% of the DW. Carbon and nitrogen contents (Carbon: 17-22%, Nitrogen: 3-5% of the DW) of both aggregate and solitary forms were found to be high relative to data reported in the literature. Although some unidentified organic compounds are not included in our carbon budget, the findings of this study show higher than previously reported nutritional values of S. thompsoni. In spite of this, a shift from a krill-dominated towards a salp-dominated ecosystem would have dramatic consequences for organisms at higher trophic levels.																	0025-3162	1432-1793				JUN	2006	149	3					625	632		10.1007/s00227-005-0226-8							WOS:000238327200019

One year of data from these locations was used previously to describe the oceanographic conditions at those times; using the much greater volume of data now available, we identify which features appear temporally robust and which are transient, and begin addressing topics relating to the forcing of the inter-annual variability and the potential consequences for the local ecosystem. Waters on the shelf and those over the adjacent deep ocean invariably have different hydrographic properties, though the transition between them can be abrupt or gradual. The onshelf/offshelf differences vary greatly from year to year, due to the combined influences of local and remote processes. There are several instances of strong physical coupling between the eastern and northwestern sides of South Georgia; this offers potential for distinguishing physically-induced ecosystems changes separately from biologically-induced ecosystems changes. On the northeast side of the shelf, close to Cumberland Bay, there is evidence of an often intense, but variable, cyclonic circulation that is the result of interaction with the local bathymetry. This may act as a retention mechanism, and enhance local productivity. Two examples of extreme cold anomalies are present in the series of measurements. One of these (in 2000/2001) affected a limited area at the eastern side of the region surveyed and was due to an intrusion of the Southern Antarctic Circumpolar Current Front. The other (in early 1998) was due to the combined effects of the passage of a large-scale ocean anomaly that had its origins upstream in the Pacific Ocean, and strong air/sea interaction. Both of these were associated with the strong 1997/1998 El Nino event. Whilst previous studies have observed a link between El Nino forcing and ocean response around South Georgia with a temporal lag of around 3 years, we observe a much more rapid response to the extremely strong 1997/1998 El Nino event. This indicates that the ocean and ecosystem around South Georgia are more immediately susceptible to extreme instances of remote climatic forcing than had been supposed. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Very low values of zooplankton biomass were observed in all the size classes studied. About 56% of total biomass was due to the large size fraction (1-14 mm) while the smallest one (200-500 mu m) accounted for about 26%. Gut fluorescence values increased in relation to the size class considered, as expected, being the differences from the smaller to the highest size fractions of orders of magnitude. Calculated ingestion rates showed that about 60-80% of total zooplankton ingestion(<14 mm) was due to the smaller organisms. Higher average values and higher variability of specific ETS activity was observed in the smaller size fraction while no differences between size classes were observed for the specific ATC activity. Biomass, gut fluorescence, ETS and ATC activities were not significantly different between the Bellingshausen and Weddell waters, although higher standard deviation was normally found at the former area. With the restrictions of using the above indices to estimate physiological rates, potential grazing of mesozooplankton (<14 mm) accounted for a rather low portion (<10%) of the primary production. The index of growth showed high values, suggesting no food limitation of mesozooplankton. Therefore, other processes such as predation should account for the very low biomass found and for the fate of a large portion of primary production.

Identification of marine Important Bird and Biodiversity Areas for penguins around the South Shetland Islands and South Orkney Islands	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION												Aim To provide a method of analyzing penguin tracking data to identify priority at-sea areas for seabird conservation (marine IBAs), based on pre-existing approaches for flying seabirds but revised according to the specific ecology of Pygoscelis penguin species. Location Waters around the Antarctic Peninsula, South Shetland, and South Orkney archipelagos (FAO Subareas 48.1 and 48.2). Methods We made key improvements to the pre-existing protocol for identifying marine IBAs that include refining the track interpolation method and revision of parameters for the kernel analysis (smoothing factor and utilization distribution) using sensitivity tests. We applied the revised method to 24 datasets of tracking data on penguins (three species, seven colonies, and three different breeding stages-incubation, brood, and creche). Results We identified five new marine IBAs for seabirds in the study area, estimated to hold ca. 600,000 adult penguins. Main conclusions The results demonstrate the efficacy of a new method for the designation of a network of marine IBAs in Antarctic waters for penguins based on tracking data, which can contribute to an evidence-based, precautionary, management framework for krill fisheries.

We tracked 31 juvenile southern elephant seals from Macquarie Island (158degrees57'E, 54degrees30'S) over their annual post-moult and mid-year trips to sea. We calculated the amount of time spent in regional fisheries management areas and within bounded oceanographic regions. During the austral summer, juvenile seals spent over 90% of their time south of the Antarctic Polar Front and similar to80% within fisheries management regions [Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR) and exclusive economic zones]. In winter, seals spent similar to75% of their time in the region bounded by the Antarctic Polar Front and the southern boundary of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current, and similar to60% within fisheries management regions. The time spent per region differed significantly between summer and winter. Our results demonstrate that juvenile southern elephant seals from Macquarie Island spent more time south of the Antarctic Polar Front and within fisheries management areas than previously suspected.

We acoustically detected thousands of bubble trails that were strongly correlated with the number of visually detected murres, providing a new tool for quantitatively studying the foraging ecology of diving birds. At the regional scale, the number of acoustically detected bubble trails, which served as a proxy for diving murre abundance, was related to the combined availability and vertical accessibility of squid, krill, and pollock. There were, however, no clear relationships at this scale between diving murres and any individual prey taxon, highlighting the importance of prey diversity to these animals. Individual krill patches targeted by murres had higher krill density and were located shallower than the mean depth of krill patches, but were similar in total krill abundance and overall size. The diving depth of murres within krill patches was highly correlated to the depth of the upper edge of these patches, whereas murres found outside of krill patches showed a depth distribution similar to that of juvenile pollock. Throughout the study area, murres showed strong diel patterns in their diving behavior in response to the diel migrations of their prey. These results suggest that murres select prey with specific patch characteristics implying effective information gathering about prey by murres. The high proportion of diving murres in aggregations and their consistent inter-individual spacing support the hypothesis that intra-specific local enhancement may facilitate foraging in these predators.

We review the available data on the region's physical characteristics (currents and ice concentrations) and their spatial variations, as well as components of the neritic food web, including lower and middle levels (phytoplankton, zooplankton, krill, fishes), the upper trophic levels (seals, penguins, pelagic birds, whales) and benthic fauna. A hypothetical food web is presented. Biotic interactions, such as the role of Euphausia crystallorophias and Pleuragramma antarcticum as grazers of lower levels and food for higher trophic levels, are suggested as being critical. The neritic food web contrasts dramatically with others in the Antarctic that appear to be structured around the keystone species Euphausia superba. Similarly, we suggest that benthic-pelagic coupling is stronger in the Ross Sea than in most other Antarctic regions. We also highlight many of the unknowns within the food web, and discuss the impacts of a changing Ross Sea habitat on the ecosystem.																	0962-8436	1471-2970				JAN 29	2007	362	1477					95	111		10.1098/rstb.2006.1956							WOS:000243528200006	17405209

Therefore there exists a tight coupling between their breeding success and local bio-physical conditions. The effects of fine-scale variability in environmental parameters and resource distribution on the foraging behaviour of marine predators is studied in a region of rapid environmental change. Here we use little penguin habitat preference during two years of varying environmental conditions, to investigate the interactions between environmental variables, resource distribution and penguin habitat preference. Penguins were tagged with GPS devices during a marine heatwave event in 2016 and again in 2018 during comparatively cooler conditions. We found the distribution of penguins to be highly correlated with a fine-scale horizontal SST gradient feature, which appeared on the shelf in 2016 as a result of tropical water from the East Australian Current (EAC) interacting with cooler temperate water from southern Tasmania. Spatially, warmer SST anomalies corresponded to a lower probability of little penguins utilizing an area in both years. This was despite the much more uniform SSTs which were present during 2018. By modelling little penguin habitat preferences using two biological predictors, zooplankton community abundance as an indication of general resource distribution, and krill abundance - a prey species of little penguins - we show habitat preference to be only slightly more strongly driven by prey type, than by general resource distribution. The correlation between little penguin habitat preference and both zooplankton and krill abundance could indicate a plasticity in foraging behaviour which might be beneficial if lower-trophic level structure continues to change due to warming. In light of the continued warming predicted for this region, and the preference shown for cooler SSTs, this plasticity might be important under future resource climates.

J	Cherel, Y				Cherel, Yves			Isotopic niches of emperor and Adelie penguins in Adelie Land, Antarctica	MARINE BIOLOGY												The emperor and Adelie penguins are the only two species of penguins that co-occur at high-Antarctic latitudes. We first measured and compared their isotopic niches on the same year in Adelie Land in spring, when the two species co-exist. Emperor and Adelie penguins segregated by their blood isotopic signatures, with adult delta(13)C values (-24.5 +/- 0.2 and -25.4 +/- 0.2 parts per thousand, respectively) suggesting that emperor penguins foraged in more neritic waters than Adelie penguins in spring. At that time, difference in their delta(15)N values (4.1 parts per thousand, 12.0 +/- 0.4 vs. 7.9 +/- 0.1 parts per thousand) encompassed more than one trophic level, indicating that emperor penguins preyed mainly upon fish (and squids), while Adelie penguins fed exclusively on euphausiids. Second, we compared the food of breeding adults and chicks. The isotopic signatures of adults and chicks of emperor penguins were not statistically different, but delta(15)N value of Adelie penguin chicks was higher than that of adults (10.2 +/- 0.8 vs. 9.0 +/- 0.2 parts per thousand). The difference showed that adult Adelie penguins captured higher trophic level prey, i.e. higher-quality food, for their chicks. Third, the isotopic signatures of Adelie penguins breeding in Adelie Land showed that adults fed on Antarctic krill in oceanic waters in spring and shifted to neritic waters in summer where they preyed upon ice krill for themselves and upon fish and euphausiids for their chicks. A comparison of isotopic niches revealed large overlaps in both blood delta(13)C and delta(15)N values within the community of Antarctic seabirds and pinnipeds. The continuum in delta(15)N values nevertheless encompassed more than one trophic level (5.2 parts per thousand) from Adelie penguin and crabeater seal to the Weddell seal. Such a broad continuum emphasizes the fact that all Antarctic seabirds and marine mammals feed on varying proportions of a few crustacean (euphausiids) and fish (Antarctic silverfish) species that dominate the intermediate trophic levels of the pelagic neritic and oceanic ecosystems.																	0025-3162					JUN	2008	154	5					813	821		10.1007/s00227-008-0974-3							WOS:000256340200006

Zooplankton excretion metabolites stimulate Southern Ocean phytoplankton growth	POLAR BIOLOGY												Warming over Antarctica is leading to changes in the zooplankton communities inhabiting the Southern Ocean. It has been observed that zooplankton not only regulates phytoplankton through grazing, but also through the recycling of nutrients that are essential for phytoplankton growth. In this way, the effects of warming on zooplankton populations will change the amount or proportion at which recycled nutrients are restored. To estimate how the recycled nutrients released by zooplankton populations, dominated by krill (Euphausia superba), amphipods or copepods, affect the phytoplankton uptake and communities, we performed four incubation experiments: two close to the Antarctic Peninsula and two at the Southern Atlantic Ocean. Our results showed a stimulating effect of the addition of metabolites on ammonia removal rates and on the net growth of phytoplankton communities, with different responses amongst the different phytoplankton groups. According to our results, phytoplankton net growth and community composition may be altered if this relevant source of nutrients is lost due to projected changes in the abundance or distribution of these zooplankton populations.

Serendipitous observations from animal-borne video loggers reveal synchronous diving and equivalent simultaneous prey capture rates in chinstrap penguins	MARINE BIOLOGY												Seabirds often engage in coordinated, cooperative foraging to improve detection and capture of prey. An extreme example of such coordinated behavior is synchronicity, whereby the movements of individuals are aligned temporally and spatially. Synchronous diving among penguins has been reported, but simultaneous observations of predation by synchronously diving individuals have not. We instrumented chinstrap penguins (Pygoscelis antarcticus) during their incubation period in December 2019 from Cape Shirreff, Livingston Island, Antarctica (60.79 degrees W, 62.46 degrees S) with video and depth recorders to monitor predator foraging behavior and prey consumption rates. Serendipitously, two instrumented individuals, accompanied by a third, banded individual, engaged in synchronous foraging activities on Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) for 9.25 h. This group formed ashore, transited together to their foraging area, remained in close visual contact after dives, synchronously timed diving behavior, and foraged at similar depths. Prey capture rates were positively correlated across dives and total consumption estimates were equivalent for the two instrumented birds during the video observation period. Video loggers confirmed that synchronous diving and foraging behavior are among the behavioral repertoire of chinstrap penguins and demonstrated equivalent prey capture rates by synchronously foraging predators. The results further suggest that group formation while ashore and group cohesion during a foraging trip may facilitate shared foraging success among group members.

J	Pusch, C; Hulley, PA; Kock, KH				Pusch, C; Hulley, PA; Kock, KH			Community structure and feeding ecology of mesopelagic fishes in the slope waters of King George Island (South Shetland Islands, Antarctica)	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART I-OCEANOGRAPHIC RESEARCH PAPERS												The role of mesopelagic fishes in the Southern Ocean ecosystem and more particular their trophic effect on the standing stock of mesozooplankton is at present poorly understood. To get a deeper insight in the Antarctic mid-water ecosystem the mesopelagic fish community of the King George Island slope (South Shetland Islands) was sampled with a pelagic trawl in 1996. The community structure was analysed and the feeding ecology was studied of the five most abundant species. A total of 18 mesopelagic fish species in 10 families was identified. Of these, the Nlyctophidae was the most important family by species number (9 species), individual number (98.5% of all individuals) and fish wet weight (87.3% of the total weight). The assemblage was numerically dominated by four myctophids (Electrona antarctica, Gymnoscopelus braueri, Gymnoscopelus nicholsi, Protomyctophum bolini) and one gempilyd (Paradiplospinus gracilis). Multivariate statistical analysis of the mesopelagic fish data reveals two major groups of stations according to the sampled depth: a shallow group of stations (295-450 m depth) and a deeper group of stations (440-825 m depth). The change in relative abundance of mesopelagic fish species at 440-450 m coincides with the presence of warmer and denser Circumpolar Deep Water at and below these depths. Deeper stations were characterized by a higher density and increased diversity of mesopelagic fish species. The community patterns identified correlated well with the vertical depth distribution of the most abundant species. Dietary analysis reveals that myctophids are mostly zooplanktivorous, while the gempilyd P. gracilis is classified as a piscivorous predator. The small P. bolini feed mainly on copepods of the species Metridia gerlachei, while the most important prey item of the larger myctophids E antarctica, G. braueri, and G. nicholsi were various species of euphausiids. Investigation of feeding chronology showed that G. nicholsi and P. bolini were feeding day and night. Daily ration estimates for myctophid species ranged from 0.28% to 3.3% of dry body weight (0.5-5.94% of wet body weight). Krill (Euphausia superba) were the most important food of E antarctica and G. nicholsi, accounting for 53.1% and 58.3% of the total food weight, respectively. The annual removal from the krill stock by both species was estimated to amount to 11.1-26.7% in the South Shetland Islands region. This estimate emphasizes the important role of mesopelagic fish in the Antarctic ecosystem as a prevalent consumer of krill. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

All species were rare, with sightings of southern right whales being the most common event. Two right whales photographed off South Georgia matched animals known from Peninsula Valdes, Argentina, a population known to be growing at 7% per annum. In contrast, blue and fin whales appeared to be less abundant. A single blue whale mot-her-calf pair was observed off the Shag Rocks in February 1997. Extirpation. of animals from this particular feeding ground is the most likely reason for ongoing law numbers of all species. Other factors may include competition for krill by traditional predators such as penguins and seals and more recently by humans, an unusually high rate of natural mortality, habitat change such as alteration in sea ice coverage, and/or the impact of ongoing whaling. The history of this critical area of large-whale habitat and this report demonstrate the need for improved, consistent longterm monitoring of population trends for these depleted stocks.

The diet of this species is generally studied by visual analysis of stomach contents; or ratios of isotopes of carbon and nitrogen incorporated into the penguin from its food. There are significant limitations to the information that can be gained from these methods. We evaluated population diet assessment by analysis of food DNA in scats as an alternative method for ecosystem monitoring with Adelie penguins as an indicator species. Scats were collected at four locations, three phases of the breeding cycle, and in four different years. A novel molecular diet assay and bioinformatics pipeline based on nuclear small subunit ribosomal RNA gene (SSU rDNA) sequencing was used to identify prey DNA in 389 scats. Analysis of the twelve population sample sets identified spatial and temporal dietary change in Adelie penguin population diet. Prey diversity was found to be greater than previously thought. Krill, fish, copepods and amphipods were the most important food groups, in general agreement with other Adelie penguin dietary studies based on hard part or stable isotope analysis. However, our DNA analysis estimated that a substantial portion of the diet was gelatinous groups such as jellyfish and comb jellies. A range of other prey not previously identified in the diet of this species were also discovered. The diverse prey identified by this DNA-based scat analysis confirms that the generalist feeding of Adelie penguins makes them a useful indicator species for prey community composition in the coastal zone of the Southern Ocean. Scat collection is a simple and non-invasive field sampling method that allows DNA-based estimation of prey community differences at many temporal and spatial scales and provides significant advantages over alternative diet analysis approaches.

DDT and its degradation products, namely DDE and DDD, are also considered. Silica gel, alumina, armnopropyl-silica, cyanopropyl-silica, florisil, graphitized nonporous carbon and silica gel-alumina mixture (3:1) were used for column chromatography cleanup in combination with modified supercritical CO2 as a mobile phase. Recovery and reproducibility were evaluated by analyzing standard solutions and standard reference materials containing various classes of pollutants. A silica gel-alumina mixture was found to be the most effective in the cleanup of organic extracts, allowing quantitative recoveries of all analytes to be obtained. Finally, the application of the optimized procedure to the determination of PCBs in Antarctic krill samples is presented. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Janes, DN				Janes, DN			Energetics, growth, and body composition of Adelie penguin chides, Pygoscelis adeliae	PHYSIOLOGICAL ZOOLOGY												Adelie penguins are very abundant in Antarctica and constitute a large biomass of predatory consumers in the Antarctic ecosystem. Adi lies eat almost exclusively krill (Euphausia spp.), and to determine krill requirements by Adelies, information on energetics is needed, including energy intake of the chicks. I measured energy use and growth in Adelie penguin chicks, using both field and laboratory techniques. Field metabolic rate was quite variable, but mass-specific rates were not correlated with body mass. Growth followed the logistic equation: the growth constant was 0.143 d(-1), and the asymptote for growth to fledging was 3,200 g. Different body organs had similar energy densities (in kilojoules per gram of dry mass), and total body energy density did not vary with chick mass. However, proportional mass of the skin increased rapidly as chicks grew, making the skin an important energy store in larger chicks. Metabolic efficiency measured in the laboratory averaged 69% and did not vary with chick mass. Total energy ingested over the 50-d development period was 162 MJ, which corresponds to approximately 33.6 kg of fresh krill. Previous studies of Adelie energetics have focused on adult energy balance and have calculated chick energy requirements indirectly on the basis of adults' stomach loads of krill and frequency of feeding chicks. Values from previous studies do not agree with those from the present study. The method used in the present study is more informative and accurate for measuring energy use by chicks, since measurements are made directly from chicks.																	0031-935X					MAR-APR	1997	70	2					237	243		10.1086/639586							WOS:A1997WL01500013	9231397					
J	Delarue, J; Guriec, N				Delarue, Jacques; Guriec, Nathalie			Opportunities to enhance alternative sources of long-chain n-3 fatty acids within the diet	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NUTRITION SOCIETY												Health benefits or advocated health benefits of long-chain (LC) n-3 PUFA are better known by medical doctors as well as by consumers, so that consumption increases. In addition, the development of aquaculture requires more fishmeal and fish oil. Humanisation of care of companion animals is also associated with addition of LC n-3 PUFA in pet foods. The risk of the increased demand for LC n-3 PUFA is the excess harvesting of natural sources, especially of marine origin (oily fishes, krill). In order to improve sustainability, alternative sources of LC n-3 PUFA have been developed. These alternative sources are: (a) terrestrial plants naturally or genetically enriched in stearidonic acid (SDA), which bypasses the first limiting step of (i.e. Delta 6 desaturase) of the biosynthesis of LC n-3 PUFA; (b) single-cell oils rich in LC n-3 PUFA (microalgae, Escherichia coli) and krill. Currently, plants rich in SDA are expensive, metabolic engineering is unfavourably accepted by consumers in many countries, cultivation of microalgae is very expensive even though their ability (for some of them) to synthesise biofuels could induce a decrease in industrial costs, and Antarctic krill harvest must be restricted. Thus, it is difficult to predict their real development in the future.																	0029-6651	1475-2719				AUG	2014	73	3					376	384		10.1017/S0029665114000123							WOS:000340177700003	24886839

The specific metabolic rates of S. thompsoni were weight-independent. No significant differences between the aggregate and solitary forms were observed for the weight-specific rates with the exception of the oxygen consumption rate on phosphorus weight. Metabolic loss estimated for the aggregate and solitary forms was 3.0 and 3.5% day(-1) for body carbon, 1.6 and 1.8% for body nitrogen, 3.9 and 10.6% for body phosphorus, respectively. Contents of carbon (6.0% of dry weight for the aggregate form and 5.1% for the solitary form), nitrogen (1.5 and 1.3%) and phosphorus (0.15 and 0.11%) tended to decrease with the increase of dry weight. All mean values of each body constituent (water, ash, C, N and P) for the aggregate and solitary forms were not significantly different in the same dry weight ranges.																	0142-7873	1464-3774				SEP	2004	26	9					1025	1037		10.1093/plankt/fbh093							WOS:000223948300005

We examined the cephalopod prey of adult penguins at a breeding colony on South Georgia during 4 austral summers, 1990 to 1994. The most important prey (similar to 97 % by mass) of the king penguins was found, in a related study, to be mesopelagic fish, mainly myctophids. The penguins' cephalopod prey, which constituted the remaining 3%, was shown in this study to be dominated by the ommastrephid squid Martialia hyadesi, both in terms of numbers and biomass. Other squid species were typical of the South Georgia/Antarctic Polar Front (APF) area but only relatively small specimens were present and, apart from Gonatus antarcticus, the presence of flesh indicated that they were probably mostly caught close to the island. M. hyadesi generally fell in the same size range as M. hyadesi exploited by commercial fisheries in the South Atlantic. In the 1992/93 summer, when krill was abundant at South Georgia, the amount of squid consumed, especially M. hyadesi, was substantially less than in the other years. This coincided with a reduction in the amount of the myctophid Krefftichthys anderssoni, which is the major prey of M. hyadesi, in the penguin diet. The total consumption of cephalopods by the king penguin at South Georgia is estimated to be about 75 000 t yr(-1). Of this, some 3600 to 6000 t yr(-1) is estimated to be M. hyadesi. This might underestimate consumption if the penguins consume a greater proportion of squid in the winter, as they do in other sectors of the Southern Ocean.

To minimize colony-induced or annual foraging challenges, diet may vary among individuals, but few studies have simultaneously investigated the effects of both extrinsic conditions (e.g. colony or year effects) and parameters of an individual (e.g. sex, age or individual quality) on diet in seabirds. Using stable isotope analyses, we studied the diet of 214 Adelie penguins Pygoscelis adeliae of known sex, age and breeding quality, nesting in 2 colonies on Ross Island, Antarctica, over 3 breeding seasons. During the study, delta N-15 and delta C-13 isotope values were lower in penguins breeding at Cape Crozier compared to those at Cape Bird, revealing a difference in prey proportions. Cape Bird penguins were estimated to consistently consume more energy-rich silverfish Pleuragramma antarctica, while birds at Cape Crozier ate more crystal krill Euphausia crystallorophias. We also found inter-annual differences in diet, with a higher dietary fish proportion in both colonies during 2011. Males had significantly higher delta N-15 values, indicating a higher fish consumption than females. This sexual segregation in diet was particularly pronounced at Cape Bird, where the overall isotopic niche was wider than at Cape Crozier. Differences in diet among adults of varying ages only existed at Cape Bird, where middle-aged penguins consumed more fish than old and young penguins. This study provides evidence that Adelie penguin diet is largely driven by annual, seasonal and local abundances of prey, with only some individuals selectively foraging for more nutritional prey if prey choices are present.

T gaudichaudii occurred in high densities (up to 61 individuals m(-3)) in the water column, being more abundant within islands in the western part of the gulf than at open gulf and shelf stations. The amphipod was a major prey of all seabird species investigated except the South Georgian diving petrel, accounting for 39, 80, 68, 59 and 46% of the total number of prey of blue petrels, thin-billed prions, Antarctic prions, common diving petrels and southern rockhopper penguins, respectively. The length-frequency distribution of T gaudichaudii was similar between the 2 diving species, which fed on 1 large size class of adult individuals, whereas the 3 surface-feeding seabirds preyed upon 2 size classes but in different proportions. Juveniles and adults T gaudichaudii were equally important in the diet of blue petrels, whereas juveniles and adults predominated in the food of thin-billed and Antarctic prions, respectively. Comparison of T gaudichaudii found in nets and food samples together with observations at sea indicated that common diving petrels and southern rockhopper penguins fed in the close vicinity of the colonies in the Golfe du Morbihan, whereas blue petrels, and thin-billed and Antarctic prions mainly preyed upon amphipods outside the sampled area. Our study shows that T.gaudichaudii an important local component of the macrozooplankton community and the main prey for planktivorous seabirds inhabiting the Kerguelen archipelago. In certain areas of the subantarctic zone, it therefore has a trophic role similar to that of Antarctic krill Euphausia superba further south, in Antarctic waters.																	0171-8630						2001	223						261	276		10.3354/meps223261							WOS:000173348700023

Krill (Euphausia superba) dominated the diet as frequency of occurrence (in 100% of samples), number (> 99%), and percentage contribution in weight (> 94.8%). Other prey items were minor and varied between years. The weight of stomach contents was significantly different. The percentage in weight of whole krill was used to compare the feeding conditions across seasons. It differed significantly at the three sites studied. Distribution of krill size varied among years and localities, showing different krill availability for penguins.																	0722-4060	1432-2056				JUN	2010	33	6					799	806		10.1007/s00300-009-0757-4							WOS:000277556400007

Distribution, growth, diet and foraging behaviour of the yellow-fin notothen Patagonotothen guntheri (Norman) on the Shag Rocks shelf (Southern Ocean)	JOURNAL OF FISH BIOLOGY												The distribution, total length (L-T) frequency and diet of Patagonotothen guntheri are described from 14 bottom trawl surveys conducted on the Shag Rocks and South Georgia shelves in the austral summers from 1986 to 2006. Patagonotothen guntheri (80-265 mm L-T) were caught on the Shag Rocks shelf from depths of 111 to 470 m, but no specimens were caught on the South Georgia shelf. Multiple cohorts were present during each survey and L-T-frequency analysis of these cohorts suggests that growth was slow (von Bertalanffy K = 0.133). Evidence from stomach contents and acoustic data (2005 and 2006) showed that P. guntheri is primarily a pelagic feeder, migrating from the sea floor towards the surface to feed during daylight. The diet of smaller fish (< 140 mm) was dominated by copepods, predominantly Rhincalanus gigas, whilst larger fish principally consumed the pelagic hyperiid amphipod, Themisto gaudichaudii and Antarctic krill Euphausia superba. Some larger fish also took benthic prey. (C) 2008 The Authors Journal compilation (C) 2008 The Fisheries Society of the British Isles.

Their relatively well-developed olfactory structures suggest that they could identify the specific odours given off by planktonic prey such as krill aggregations. Like other marine predators, they may also detect dimethyl sulfide (DMS), a chemical released in areas of high marine productivity. However, dedicated behavioural studies still have to be conducted in baleen whales in order to confirm the involvement of chemoreception in their feeding ecology. We implemented 56 behavioural response experiments in humpback whales using two food-related chemical stimuli, krill extract and DMS, as well as their respective controls (orange clay and vegetable oil) in their breeding (Madagascar) and feeding grounds (Iceland and Antarctic Peninsula). The whales approached the stimulus area and stayed longer in the trial zone during krill extract trials compared to control trials, suggesting that they were attracted to the chemical source and spent time exploring its surroundings, probably in search of prey. This response was observed in Iceland, and to a lesser extend in Madagascar, but not in Antarctica. Surface behaviours indicative of sensory exploration, such as diving under the stimulus area and stopping navigation, were also observed more often during krill extract trials than during control trials. Exposure to DMS did not elicit such exploration behaviours in any of the study areas. However, acoustic analyses suggest that DMS and krill extract both modified the whales' acoustic activity in Madagascar. Altogether, these results provide the first behavioural evidence that baleen whales actually perceive prey-derived chemical cues over distances of several hundred metres. Chemoreception, especially olfaction, could thus be used for locating prey aggregations and for navigation at sea, as it has been shown in other marine predators including seabirds.

During the first few weeks of March the seals were moving in the pack ice along the continental shelf edge, close to the coast of Queen Maud Land. In April and May, when the pack ice extended northwards, most of the seals moved north, one reaching 63 degrees S in late May. In the first half of June the two remaining seals turned south and moved back deep into the pack ice. The seals made about 150 dives per day each throughout the study period. Ninety percent of these were made to depths of less than 52 m. Individual maximum diving depths varied between 288 and 528 m. In March the seals were most active at night, when the dive depth was shallower than during the day. In April and May the seals were more active during day-time, with an absence of any diurnal change in diving depth. These results support the notion that crabeater seals predominantly feed on krill in Antarctic pack ice, even when winter returns to the waters off Queen Maud Land.																	0722-4060					APR	1995	15	4					261	268									WOS:A1995QV57000004

Fatty acid trophic markers elucidate resource partitioning within the demersal fish community of South Georgia and Shag Rocks (Southern Ocean)	MARINE BIOLOGY												Fatty acid analysis was used to study the trophic ecology of 10 demersal fish species in the South Georgia region. Principal component analysis grouped the species into three general clusters, revealing resource partitioning between species. Two groups were characterised by large proportions of either monounsaturated or polyunsaturated fatty acids, separating species according to their predominant feeding habitat. The third group showed fatty acid signatures overlapping with either or both of the previous two groups, suggesting a more opportunistic feeding behaviour for these species. Intraspecific comparisons furthermore revealed dietary variability with size, year and geographical location in several species. Mackerel icefish (Champsocephalus gunnari) in particular showed inter-annual differences in muscle lipid concentrations closely linked to prey availability with low lipid contents found in years of low krill (Euphausia superba) abundance. Despite the intraspecific differences the majority of species could be easily distinguished from each other, which indicates the utility of this method in the dietary analysis of higher predators.

These areas are separated from photosynthetic primary productivity by thick ice and distance to open water. Nevertheless, a diverse macrofaunal benthic community was discovered at 188 m depth, 80 km back from the edge of the McMurdo Ice Shelf. The general habitat was fine sediment with occasional dropstones, and dominant taxa were polychaetes and brittle stars, with alcyonacean soft corals and anemones on hard substrates. Gelatinous animals were abundant near the seafloor, and possibly part of a food web that supports the benthic community.																	0954-1020	1365-2079				APR	2019	31	2					80	88	PII S0954102018000561	10.1017/S0954102018000561							WOS:000463086400005

During late winter/early spring older stages of C. acutus were concentrated below 500 m. Males had reduced mouthparts and were only found in October/November in deep waters where mating occurred. Females with semiripe and ripe gonads migrated to the surface in November to spawn. Their ascent coincided with an increase in swimming and respiration activity. In summer the majority of C. acutus occurred above 200 m and the density increased dramatically as the new cohort hatched. Copepodite stage CV and females in the surface layers had large lipid depots by the end of January, mainly wax esters. They seem to start their descent by mid February. C. propinquus also occurred in deeper waters in late winter/early spring, but above 500 m. Males had well-developed mouthparts and were found in small numbers throughout both investigated periods. No great changes in activity were observed from late winter to summer. The summer population was concentrated in the upper 100 m. As for C. acutus there was a dramatic increase in abundance of C. propinquus from January to February. The lipid content of CV stages and females doubled from January to February and reached similar maximum values at least 3 wk later in the season than C. acutus. The lipids of C. propinquus consisted mainly of triacylglycerol, a very unusual storage lipid class in polar calanoid copepods. C. acutus and C. propinquus seem to represent different life histories: the wax-ester-accumulating C. acutus overwinters in a resting stage in deeper waters while the triacylglycerol-storing C. propinquus may feed and reproduce over a more extended period than C. acutus.

A detailed and greatly expanded Ad,lie penguin dietary record dated back to 7,200 years BP has been reconstructed for the investigated area. Our data indicate a significant dietary shift between fish and krill, with a gradual decrease from past to present time in the proportion of fish compared to krill in Ad,lie penguin diet. From 7,200 to 2,000 years BP, delta C-13 and delta N-15 values indicate fish as the most eaten prey. The dietary contribution of lower-trophic prey in penguin diet started becoming evident not earlier than 2,000 years BP, when the delta C-13 values reveal a change in the penguin feeding behavior. Modern eggshell and guano samples reveal a major dietary contribution of krill but not a krill-dominated diet, since delta C-13 values remain much too high if krill prevail in the diet. According to the Holocene environmental background attested for Victoria Land, Ad,lie penguin dietary shifts between fish and krill seem to reflect penguin paleoecological responses to different paleoenvironmental settings with different conditions of sea-ice extension and persistence. Furthermore, Ad,lie penguin diet appears to be particularly affected by environmental changes in a very specific period within the breeding season, namely the egg-laying period when penguin dietary and feeding habit shifts are clearly documented by the delta C-13 of eggshell carbonate.

Genetic structure of declining chinstrap penguin (Pygoscelis antarcticus) populations from South Shetland Islands (Antarctica)	POLAR BIOLOGY												Seabirds and their response to climate perturbations are important bioindicators of changes in Antarctic ecosystems. During 30 years of observations of two chinstrap penguin (Pygoscelis antarcticus) colonies, one on King George Island and the other on Penguin Island (South Shetland Islands, Antarctica), the size of the breeding populations decreased by 84 and 41 %, respectively. We applied analyses of amplified fragment length polymorphisms to study the genetic structure of the two populations and to evaluate the influence of the sudden population decrease. Our data indicate that there were only weak genetic differences between the populations, which were not strong enough to support the hypothesis of population differentiation. Weak genetic differences observed between the two populations seem not to be determined by selection processes. We hypothesize that the very low level of between-population genetic structure can be explained by some extent of genetic drift, which is largely compensated by gene flow. Moreover, the two populations seem to remain in a stationary state. Our results support the hypothesis of limited natal philopatry in chinstrap penguins. The observed decrease in population size is probably caused by emigration or a rise in juvenile mortality due to the increasing krill limitation of the marine food web. However, detailed research is required to address this issue.

Such competition is reduced by resource-partitioning strategies that may affect physiology. For instance, diet and feeding strategies may affect the antioxidant defences or the production of reactive oxygen species. Oxidative stress is defined as the imbalance between pro-oxidants and antioxidant defences. If such an imbalance favours the former, this can lead to oxidative damage, and oxidative stress increases. However, to our knowledge, how free-ranging animals adjust their oxidative status in relation to their foraging habitats, diet and dietary antioxidants has not yet been studied. Penguins are an interesting biological model for such a comparison because their diet, based on krill, fish and/or cephalopods, presents strong variation in dietary antioxidant content. We therefore examined trophic level (delta N-15), foraging habitat (delta C-13), dietary antioxidants (retinol, alpha-tocopherol and astaxanthin) and oxidative status (plasma non-enzymatic antioxidant capacity and oxidative damage) in pygoscelid penguins (chinstrap Pygoscelis antarcticus, gentoo P. papua and Adelie P. adeliae) breeding in Antarctica. We found interspecific differences in all variables analysed except alpha-tocopherol. Gentoo penguins exploited more cephalopods and fish in coastal and benthic habitats, Adelies showed an intermediate position, whereas chinstraps foraged more on krill and fish in pelagic waters. Dietary antioxidant levels showed specific patterns resulting in relationships with prey items. However, we did not find any clear relationships between dietary antioxidants and species-specific antioxidant capacity, suggesting the importance of endogenously produced antioxidants. Oxidative status appeared to be differently related to foraging strategy and antioxidant capacity in each species.																	0171-8630	1616-1599				APR 29	2021	665						201	216		10.3354/meps13651							WOS:000649299900015						
J	HUNT, GL				HUNT, GL			MARINE ECOLOGY OF SEABIRDS IN POLAR OCEANS	AMERICAN ZOOLOGIST												Patterns of seabird species' distributions differ between the Antarctic and the Arctic. In the Antarctic, distributions are annular or latitudinal, with strong similarities in species composition of seabird communities in all ocean basins at a given latitude. In the Arctic, communities are arranged meridionally, and show strong differences between ocean basins and, at a given latitude, between sides of ocean basins. these differences between the seabird communities in the Northern Hemisphere and the Southern Hemisphere reflect differences in the patterns of flow of major ocaen current systems. At smaller spatial scales, in both hemispheres the species composition of seabird communities is sensitive to changes in watermass characteristics. The distribution of avian biomass is affected by both physical and biological features of the ocean. In the Antarctic, much seabird foraging is over deep water, and within-season, small-scale patchiness in prey abundance and availability in ice-free waters is likely to be controlled primarily by the behavior of the prey, rather than by physical features. Thus, prey availability may be unpredictable in time and space. In contrast, in the Northern Hemisphere, most seabird foraging is concentrated over shallow continental shelves, where currents interact with bathymetry to produce predictable physical features capable of concentrating prey or making prey more easily harvested by seabirds. Ice cover appears to be the most important physical feature in the Antarctic. An entire community of birds is specialized to use prey taken near the ice edge. These prey consist of a variety of species, some of which are normally found much deeper in the water than the birds taking them can dive. The open-water portion of the marginal ice zone is also an important foraging habitat for Antarctic marine birds. In the Arctic, a food web based on underice algae is used by marine birds, but few if any data exist on avian use of the open water segment of the marginal ice zone. Recent simultaneous surveys of birds and their prey indicate that only rarely does the small-scale abundance of birds match that of their prey; correlations between predators and prey are generally stronger at larger scales. Evidence is accumulating in the Antarctic that the largest aggregations of krill may be disproportionately important to foraging seabirds.

To determine the importance of microbial grazers in controlling microbial abundance, we determined microbial standing stocks and rates of herbivory and bacterivory in relation to the physical environment off East Antarctica during the Baseline Research on Oceanography, Krill and the Environment: West (BROKE-West) survey, which covered waters from the Polar Front to the coast between 30 and 80 degrees E. Concentrations of heterotrophic nanoflagellates (HNF) (similar to 2 to 20 pm), microzooplankton (similar to 20 to 200 mu m), bacteria, and chlorophyll a (Chl a) were determined and the growth and grazing mortality of phytoplankton and bacteria were estimated using the grazing dilution technique at 22 sites along the survey. Results showed that microzooplankton and HNF consumed on average 52% of bacterial production d(-1) and 62% primary production d(-1) but consumed > 100% d(-1) at the western ice-edge sites. Rates of bacterivory ranged from 0.4 - 2.6 d(-1) and were correlated with bacterial concentrations, bacterial growth rates and longitude. Rates were highest in the eastern-most part of the survey, which was sampled last, reflecting the transition along the successional continuum toward a respiration-based, senescent, microbial community. Rates of herbivory ranged from 0.3 to 2.4 d(-1) and were correlated with concentrations of microzooplankton and HNF combined, rates of phytoplankton growth, and latitude. Rates were highest at southern ice edge sites where concentrations of prey (as represented by Chl a) and microzooplankton were also highest. Cluster analysis of the concentrations of marine microbes and their rates of growth and grazing mortality identified 5 groups of sample sites that conveniently summarised the variability in the composition and function of the microbial community. Cluster groups differentiated between low Chl a (similar to 0.3 mu g l(-1)) open ocean Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) communities: and high Chl a (similar to 2.4 mu g l(-1)) ice-associated coastal blooms at various stages between bloom formation and senescence. This partitioning of cluster groups can be used to determine spatial and temporal patterns of carbon transfer by the microbial loop within the BROKE-West survey area.

Body condition as an index of winter foraging success in crabeater seals (Lobodon carcinophaga)	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY												Body composition is a direct measure of body condition and as such integrates seasonal variation in foraging success and energy expenditure. In phocids, body condition is a critical determinant of both reproductive effort and ability to survive periods of poor foraging success. We determined body composition in 29 crabeater seals, Lobodon carcinophaya, during austral autumn (April-May 2002) and late winter (August-September 2001, 2002) off the Antarctic Peninsula by measuring blubber depth and taking morphometric (length, girth) measurements. In 15 of these seals, we also measured body composition using the labeled-water dilution technique. The two methods produced similar body composition estimates, with an average difference of 7%. There were no differences in body composition between adult males and females or between autumn and late winter. These findings Suggest that by autumn, adult seals have replenished their energy stores following reproduction and molt. Similarly, the absence of seasonal variation in adults indicates that seals are Successfully foraging throughout winter. In addition to providing insight into seasonal and age-related variation in body composition, this study provides baseline body condition data that can be used to measure impacts of natural or anthropogenic environmental change oil one of the large consumers of Antarctic krill.

Distribution of Phaeocystis antarctica-dominated sea ice algal communities and their potential to seed phytoplankton across the western Antarctic Peninsula in spring	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												The western Antarctic Peninsula has experienced extreme changes in the timing of sea ice melt and freeze up, shortening the duration of the seasonal sea ice cycle. While previous research demonstrated connections between multiple pelagic trophic levels and the physics of the sea ice, few studies have assessed the sea ice ecosystem or its linkage to the ocean ecosystem in this region. Through a field survey and shipboard experiments, our study focused on characterizing the spring ice algal bloom and elucidating its role in seeding phytoplankton communities postice melt in high and low light conditions. Field data revealed that algal communities in slush layers, often formed from the flooding of seawater (infiltration layers), dominated biomass distributions in the sea ice throughout the region, and showed distinct photophysiological characteristics from interior or bottom ice communities. Sea ice algal biomass reached 120 mg chl a m(-2) and was often dominated by Phaeocystis antarctica. Shipboard growth experiments showed that prior light history (ice or water column), rather than community composition (phytoplankton and ice algae were composed of similar taxa), primarily drove physiological responses to high and low light. P. antarctica generally dominated the community in growth experiments at the end of the 6 d incubation period. Settling column experiments suggested that P. antarctica's higher sinking rates relative to other taxa may explain its minor contributions to the summer phytoplankton community in single-cell form and its absence in colonial form, observed in the long-term ecological record of this region.

In concert with environmental change, the potential for direct human disturbance resulting from tourism, scientific programs, and commercial fisheries continues to rise in the region. While seabirds, such as the gentoo penguinPygoscelis papua, are commonly used to assess the impact of these disturbances on natural systems, research efforts are often hampered by limited spatial coverage and lack of temporal resolution. Using a large-scale remote time-lapse camera network and a modeling framework adapted from capture-recapture studies, we assess drivers of intra- and inter-annual dynamics in gentoo penguin breeding success across nearly the entire species' range in the Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean. We quantify the precise timing of egg/chick mortality within each season and examine the role of precipitation events, tourism visitation, and fishing activity for Antarctic krillEuphausia superba(a principal prey resource in the Antarctic) in these processes. We find that nest failure rates are higher in the egg than the chick stage and that neither krill fishing nor tourism visitation had a strong effect on gentoo penguin breeding success. While precipitation events had, on average, little effect on nest mortality, results suggest that extreme weather events can precipitate sharp increases in nest failure. This study highlights the importance of continuous ecosystem monitoring, facilitated here by remote time-lapse cameras, in understanding ecological responses to environmental stressors, particularly with regard to the timing of events such as extreme weather.

J	Grunbaum, D				Grunbaum, D			Schooling as a strategy for taxis in a noisy environment	EVOLUTIONARY ECOLOGY												Many aquatic animals face a fundamental problem during foraging and migratory movements: while their resources commonly vary at large spatial scales, they can only sample and assess their environment at relatively small, local spatial scales. Thus, they are unable to choose movement directions by directly sampling distant parts of their environment. A common strategy to overcome this problem is taxis, a behaviour in which an animal performs a biased random walk by changing direction more rapidly when local conditions are getting worse. Such an animal spends more time moving in right directions than wrong ones, and eventually gets to a favourable area. Taxis is inefficient, however, when environmental gradients are weak or overlain by 'noisy' small-scale fluctuations. In this paper, I show that schooling behaviour can improve the ability of animals performing taxis to climb gradients, even under conditions when asocial taxis would be ineffective. Schooling is a social behaviour incorporating tendencies to remain close to and align with fellow members of a group. It enhances taxis because the alignment tendency produces tight angular distributions within groups, and dampens the stochastic effects of individual sampling errors. As a result, more school members orient up gradient than in the comparable asocial case. However, overly strong schooling behaviour makes the school slow in responding to changing gradient directions. This trade-off suggests an optimal level of schooling behaviour for given spatio-temporal scales of environmental variations. Social taxis may enhance the selective value of schooling in pelagic grazers such as herrings, anchovies and Antarctic krill. Furthermore, the degree of aggregation in a population of schooling animals may affect directly the rate and direction of migration and foraging movements.																	0269-7653					JUL	1998	12	5					503	522		10.1023/A:1006574607845							WOS:000075127900001

We hypothesized that the diet of N. marionis shifts during its development, and that spatial variability in food availability results in differentiation in the diet signatures of specimens collected from various locations of the shelf waters around the PEI. Specimens were collected from nine stations (depth range 70 to 240 m) around the PEI at inter-island shelf (from west to east: upstream, between and downstream) and nearshore regions during austral autumn 2009. Stable isotope and fatty acid data both revealed spatial and developmental variations in the shrimp diet. Nearshore shrimp were more C-13-enriched than those from the inter-island region, suggesting increased kelp detritus entered the food web in the nearshore regions. The shrimp showed increases in delta C-13 and delta N-15 signatures (and trophic position) with an increase in body size, resulting in distinctions between size classes that reflected shifts in their trophic niche through development. The fatty acid profiles similarly indicated distinctions in diet with increased shrimp size (in the deep regions), and spatial variability was evident in relation to region and depth. All shrimp contained large proportions of polyunsaturated and essential fatty acids, indicating that the quality of food consumed was similar between regions despite the diet variability. Our results provide new dietary information about a key species operating near the base of the food web at the highly productive PEI, and show that there were no areas of enhanced nutrition available to the shrimp. As such, there was no nutritional advantage to shrimp inhabiting any specific region around the PEI. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Kinjo, A; Koito, T; Kawaguchi, S; Inoue, K				Kinjo, Azusa; Koito, Tomoko; Kawaguchi, So; Inoue, Koji			Evolutionary History of the GABA Transporter (GAT) Group Revealed by Marine Invertebrate GAT-1	PLOS ONE												The GABA transporter (GAT) group is one of the major subgroups in the solute career 6 (SLC6) family of transmembrane proteins. The GAT group, which has been well studied in mammals, has 6 known members, i.e., a taurine transporter (TAUT), four GABA transporters (GAT-1, -2, -3, -4), and a creatine transporter (CT1), which have important roles in maintaining physiological homeostasis. However, the GAT group has not been extensively investigated in invertebrates; only TAUT has been reported in marine invertebrates such as bivalves and krills, and GAT-1 has been reported in several insect species and nematodes. Thus, it is unknown how transporters in the GAT group arose during the course of animal evolution. In this study, we cloned GAT-1 cDNAs from the deep-sea mussel, Bathymodiolus septemdierum, and the Antarctic krill, Euphausia superba, whose TAUT cDNA has already been cloned. To understand the evolutionary history of the GAT group, we conducted phylogenetic and synteny analyses on the GAT group transporters of vertebrates and invertebrates. Our findings suggest that transporters of the GAT group evolved through the following processes. First, GAT-1 and CT1 arose by tandem duplication of an ancestral transporter gene before the divergence of Deuterostomia and Protostomia; next, the TAUT gene arose and GAT-3 was formed by the tandem duplication of the TAUT gene; and finally, GAT-2 and GAT-4 evolved from a GAT-3 gene by chromosomal duplication in the ancestral vertebrates. Based on synteny and phylogenetic evidence, the present naming of the GAT group members does not accurately reflect the evolutionary relationships.

Zooplankton abundance was assessed by employing a new design of sampler that combined a frame net with a pump at the cod-end and which was deployed at the sea surface. Six transects using the sampler with concurrent bird observations were made over a short stretch of Stewart Strait near Bird island, South Georgia. Concentrations of a variety of zooplankton species occurred patchily along each transect. Peak numbers of prions were recorded consistently towards the southern end of each transect. These peaks coincided with peaks in zooplankton numbers, but with different prey species predominant on different occasions. Comparison of the distribution of foraging and sitting birds with the presence or absence of zooplankton peaks, after pooling zooplankton species into 2 broad classes, showed that birds were consistently observed over copepod maxima, but were not found to be associated with aggregations of larger zooplankton more often than expected by chance.

Satellite observations suggest that phytoplankton biomass in the mixed-layer has increased over the last 20 years in most (but not all) parts of the Southern Ocean, whereas primary production at the base of the mixed-layer has likely decreased over the same period. Different satellite models of primary production (Vertically Generalised versus Carbon Based Production Models) give different patterns and directions of recent change in net primary production (NPP). At present, the satellite record is not long enough to distinguish between trends and climate-related cycles in primary production. Over the next 100 years, Earth system models project increasing NPP in the water column in the MEASO northern and Antarctic zones but decreases in the Subantarctic zone. Low confidence in these projections arises from: (1) the difficulty in mapping supply mechanisms for key nutrients (silicate, iron); and (2) understanding the effects of multiple stressors (including irradiance, nutrients, temperature, pCO(2), pH, grazing) on different species of Antarctic phytoplankton. Notwithstanding these uncertainties, there are likely to be changes to the seasonal patterns of production and the microbial community present over the next 50-100 years and these changes will have ecological consequences across Southern Ocean food-webs, especially on key species such as Antarctic krill and silverfish.

AN OVERVIEW OF SOUTHERN OCEAN ZOOPLANKTON DATA: ABUNDANCE, BIOMASS, FEEDING AND FUNCTIONAL RELATIONSHIPS	CCAMLR SCIENCE												There is an enormous amount of data on Southern Ocean (SO) zooplankton, mostly on their distribution with a minority addressing rate processes. This review aims to summarise these data and show where it resides, to assist SO food-web modellers or those with limited specialist knowledge of SO zooplankton. First, a brief overview is provided of the diversity and basic biology of SO zooplankton, with an emphasis on abundance, distribution and feeding. Second, advice is provided on the uses, strengths and limitations of zooplankton data as inputs to SO data compilations or food-web models. Copepods overall comprise >75% of the SO zooplankton biomass (excluding Euphausia superba). Total mesozooplankton biomass density differs little between the Antarctic sectors, but latitudinally it is maximal in the Polar Frontal Zone and declines to the north and south. Those compiling data on numerical density (no. m(-2) or no. m(-3)) need to allow for differences in the extent of identification of early larval stages. Likewise, the time of year, depth of sampling and mesh size of sampler greatly influence the recorded abundance, since the populations can make seasonal vertical migrations and their pulsed reproduction causes great seasonal changes in size structure and abundance. Other issues are specific to polar environments, for example, lipid storage which leads to significantly different length-mass and mass-rate relationships than are reported in global literature compilations. Likewise, stenothermy (narrow temperature tolerance) means that fixed (Q(10)-type) temperature relationships based on global literature compilations must be applied with great caution in SO-specific studies. Protozoa/micrometazoa (<200 mu m) are the main grazers in the SO, since mesozooplankton typically remove <30% of primary production. This emphasises the dominant role of microbial food chains involving small metazoans, relative to the classic short diatom-krill-whale type food chains. Even within regions of abundant krill, copepod production in summer roughly triples that of postlarval E. superba. This fact reflects a large flow of energy through multiple trophic levels, via copepods and their major invertebrate predators such as other predatory copepods, chaetognaths, small omnivorous euphausiids, amphipods up to myctophid fish and birds.																	1023-4063						2012	19						171	218									WOS:000318781400007						
J	Zhou, M; Dorland, RD				Zhou, M; Dorland, RD			Aggregation and vertical migration behavior of Euphausia superba	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY												Aggregation and vertical migration behavior of Euphausia superba were studied in Marguerite Bay and its vicinity west of the Antarctic Peninsula using a vessel-mounted, Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler, and a Multiple Opening and Closing Nets and Environmental Sensing System, during the 2001 and 2002 fall US Southern Ocean GLOBEC project cruises. The kinematics of aggregation behavior of E. superba associated with diel migration is studied using observations of their abundance and swimming velocities: during the day, E. superba reduce their swimming at a depth of 250 m; and at night, they swim randomly at their cruising speed in the upper part of an aggregation near the surface, and coherently as schooling in the lower part of an aggregation. The causes for the aggregation behavior and vertical migration of krill are explored by examining the relationship with ice coverage and presence of predators. The motion of euphausiids is further analyzed in terms of kinetic energy and force balance, leading to new considerations of mathematical theories and models of aggregation behavior. The results show a diel variation of the energy demand for maintaining their locomotion. The horizontal scale of an aggregation is studied in conjunction with horizontal gradients of currents. Results indicate that the swimming capability of euphausiids determines the maintenance of an aggregation in the mesoscale circulation field. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Cope, LE; Plourde, S; Winkler, G				Cope, Laurie Emma; Plourde, Stephane; Winkler, Gesche			Seasonal variation of growth and reproduction of the subarctic krill species, Thysanoessa raschii, driven by environmental conditions in the Estuary and Gulf of St. Lawrence	JOURNAL OF PLANKTON RESEARCH												The aim of this study was to quantify somatic growth and reproduction of Thysanoessa raschii in response to environmental conditions in the St. Lawrence Estuary and Gulf of St. Lawrence, Canada. We sampled between 2010 and 2016 from spring to late summer and incubated individuals. Fresh molts were collected daily and measured to calculate the growth increment following the instantaneous growth rate method while eggs were counted daily. Our results showed a seasonal pattern of somatic growth and reproduction driven by temperature and chl. a concentration with a decrease in somatic growth in August when egg production was maximal, suggesting a trade-off. Functional relationship analyses revealed a narrow optimal temperature window for somatic growth with maximum temperatures observed between 1.2 and 2.0 degrees C in the cold intermediate layer (50-150 m). Maximum egg production was observed at temperatures between 3.8 and 5.7 degrees C in the surface layer (0-50 m). A required minimum concentration of chl. a of 9 mg.m(-3) for somatic growth was observed. For egg production, the minimum observed was integrated chl. a (0-50 m) of 80 mg.m(-2). We also observed the importance of optimal conditions lasting for one to 3 weeks to support biological processes in T. raschii.																	0142-7873	1464-3774				MAY-JUN	2021	43	3					458	474		10.1093/plankt/fbab032							WOS:000661484700010						
J	Yoshitomi, B; Yamaguchi, H				Yoshitomi, Bunji; Yamaguchi, Hideaki			Chemical composition of dried eyeballs from Euphausia superba and Euphausia pacifica	FISHERIES SCIENCE												Dried krill eyeballs were obtained from Euphausia superba and Euphausia pacifica by using a patented industry method and their chemical compositions were examined. Crude protein content was 77.7% and 80.8% of the dry matter of E. superba and E. pacifica, respectively. The dominating amino acids in both krill were glutamic acid, aspartic acid, glycine, arginine, leucine and tyrosine. Crude fat content was 10.9% and 5.4% of dry matter of E. superba and E. pacifica, respectively. The main lipid class of the extracted lipids was phospholipids at 88.5% in E. superba and 96.4% in E. pacifica. The dominating fatty acids in both krill were 22:6 (n-3), 20:5 (n-3), 16:0 and 18:1 (n-9). Astaxanthin (3, 3'-dihydroxy-beta, beta-carotene-4, 4'-dione) content of E. superba and E. pacifica was 566 mg/100 g and 252 mg/100 g of dry matter, respectively. Retinol of E. superba and E. pacifica was 153.0 mg/100 g (510 000 IU/100 g) and 57.6 mg/100 g (192 000 IU/100 g) of dry matter, respectively. The lipophilic extract of E. superba by using n-hexane contained 1923 mg/100 g of astaxanthin at approximately four times higher than the dried eyeballs.																	0919-9268	1444-2906				OCT	2007	73	5					1186	1194		10.1111/j.1444-2906.2007.01451.x							WOS:000249991500028						
J	JOIRIS, CR				JOIRIS, CR			SPRING DISTRIBUTION AND ECOLOGICAL ROLE OF SEABIRDS AND MARINE MAMMALS IN THE WEDDELL SEA, ANTARCTICA	POLAR BIOLOGY												The early spring distribution of seabirds, pinnipeds and cetaceans was quantitatively determined in the northern Weddell Sea during the EPOS 1 cruise of the icebreaking R V Polarstern. Two hundred and ninety-one half hour counts were made in the Antarctic region between October 18 and November 16, 1988 (+ 94 counts in sub-antarctic and sub-tropical water). The bird populations were dominated by the Adelie Penguin Pygoscelis adeliae, which represented 90% of the birds counted in the closed pack ice (CPI), with a mean density of 31 penguins per km2. Crabeater seal Lobodon carcinophagus, the most common pinniped, had a mean density of 1.2/km2 in the CPI with local concentrations reaching 14/km2. Expressed as biomass, mean values of about 90 kg/km2 were found in the whole Antarctic zone for seabirds, 50 for seals, and 35 for baleen cetaceans. Densities were higher in the CPI: 140, 180 and 115 kg/km2 respectively, were found for birds, pinnipeds and baleen whales, and lowest in open water (8 kg/km2 for the birds, 0.2 for the pinnipeds and no whales). A minimum value of food intake by seabirds and marine mammals was estimated to be 2.7 mg C/m2/day for the Antarctic zone (4.1 in the CPI). Taking into account that pinnipeds density and cetacean food uptake are underestimated, and that Antarctic seabirds consume much more fish than generally suspected, a minimum krill production of 16 mg C/m2/day is proposed for the Antarctic zone: 22.5 in the CPI, 3 in open water, and intermediate values in the marginal ice zones.																	0722-4060					DEC	1991	11	7					415	424									WOS:A1991GU47800001						
J	Gudmundsdottir, A				Gudmundsdottir, A			Cold-adapted and mesophilic brachyurins	BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY												Two different types of brachyurins, termed I and II, have been described in the literature. Within type I there are two subtypes, Ia and Ib. The prototype for the type I brachyurins is Fiddler crab collagenase I. Its coldadapted analogue from Antarctic krill, termed euphaulysin, shares many of its characteristics. Both enzymes are distinguished by their broad substrate specificity as well as the ability to cleave collagen. The precursor form of euphaulysin has been expressed in Pichia pastoris and processed to its fully active form using cod trypsin. A molecular model of euphaulysin, based on the known crystal structure of crab collagenase I, indicates that the core structure of these enzymes is almost identical. As a coldadapted enzyme, euphaulysin has a higher catalytic efficiency than crab collagenase I. It is also more sensitive to thermal inactivation and autolysis. Furthermore, euphaulysin has an increased length of several surface loops compared to crab collagenase I. Extended surface loops have been suggested to play a role in the cold activity of some bacterial enzymes. Sensitivity to autolysis is an important factor which contributes to the thermal instability of euphaulysin. Substitution of a highly exposed residue in the autolysis loop of euphaulysin resulted in an increased stability of the enzyme towards thermal inactivation without altering its catalytic efficiency.																	1431-6730					JUL-AUG	2002	383	7-8					1125	1131		10.1515/BC.2002.122							WOS:000177737800013	12437096

Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) measurements showed great variability in phytoplankton biomass within the Scotia Sea, with some areas having among the lowest Chl-a concentrations found in Antarctic waters (<0.1 mg m(-3) in surface waters) while other areas were among the richest with > 10 mg m(-3). This paper describes the distribution and concentration of Chl-a in the upper 100 m of the water column and relates the Chl-a profiles at individual stations to profiles of upper water-column stability, to the depth of the upper mixed layer, and to the mixing of different water masses. The 58 stations with the lowest Chl-a values in surface waters also had low values for integrated Chl-a (33.9 +/- 19.5 mg m(-2)) and a Chl-a maximum at depths of between 70 and 90 m, in contrast to all other stations where deep Chl-a maxima did not occur. The T/S diagrams at many of these stations were indicative of Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) waters. The central Scotia Sea and areas to the west and north of South Georgia had significantly higher integrated Chl-a values (98.1+/-46.0 mg m(-2), n = 57), in addition to five stations with very high Chl-a values (mean of 359+/-270 mg m(-2)). The mean rate of integrated primary production, which was estimated using the Chl-a data and the mean incident solar radiation measured from previous cruises as well as from satellite data, was estimated to be 994 mg carbon m(-2) day(-1). The temperature profiles at these stations suggested that considerable interleaving and mixing of water types had occurred, which was also evident in the T/S diagrams, which indicated mixing of ACC waters with coastal waters originating from Bransfield Strait or the Weddell Sea. There was no significant correlation between integrated Chl-a values and the profiles of upper water column stability or the depth of the upper mixed layer. The spatial variability in phytoplankton biomass within the Scotia Sea is discussed in relation to the hypothesis that low iron concentrations are the major factor controlling phytoplankton biomass in these pelagic Antarctic waters and that concentrations of iron available for phytoplankton uptake are strongly influenced by fronts and the mixing of different water masses.

Mechanisms of dissolved and labile particulate iron supply to shelf waters and phytoplankton blooms off South Georgia, Southern Ocean	BIOGEOSCIENCES												The island of South Georgia is situated in the iron (Fe)-depleted Antarctic Circumpolar Current of the Southern Ocean. Iron emanating from its shelf system fuels large phytoplankton blooms downstream of the island, but the actual supply mechanisms are unclear. To address this, we present an inventory of Fe, manganese (Mn), and aluminium (Al) in shelf sediments, pore waters, and the water column in the vicinity of South Georgia, alongside data on zooplankton-mediated Fe cycling processes, and provide estimates of the relative dissolved Fe (DFe) fluxes from these sources. Seafloor sediments, modified by authigenic Fe precipitation, were the main particulate Fe source to shelf bottom waters as indicated by the similar Fe / Mn and Fe / Al ratios for shelf sediments and suspended particles in the water column. Less than 1% of the total particulate Fe pool was leachable surface-adsorbed (labile) Fe and therefore potentially available to organisms. Pore waters formed the primary DFe source to shelf bottom waters, supplying 0.1-44 mu mol DFe m(-2) d(-1). However, we estimate that only 0.41 +/- 0.26 mu mol DFe m(-2) d(-1) was transferred to the surface mixed layer by vertical diffusive and advective mixing. Other trace metal sources to surface waters included glacial flour released by melting glaciers and via zooplankton egestion and excretion processes. On average 6.5 +/- 8.2 mu mol m(-2) d(-1) of labile particulate Fe was supplied to the surface mixed layer via faecal pellets formed by Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba), with a further 1.1 +/- 2.2 mu mol DFe m(-2) d(-1) released directly by the krill. The faecal pellets released by krill included seafloor-derived lithogenic and authigenic material and settled algal debris, in addition to freshly ingested suspended phytoplankton cells. The Fe requirement of the phytoplankton blooms similar to 1250 km downstream of South Georgia was estimated as 0.33 +/- 0.11 mu mol m(-2) d(-1), with the DFe supply by horizontal/vertical mixing, deep winter mixing, and aeolian dust estimated as similar to 0.12 mu mol m(-2) d(-1). We hypothesize that a substantial contribution of DFe was provided through recycling of biogenically stored Fe following luxury Fe uptake by phytoplankton on the Fe-rich shelf. This process would allow Fe to be retained in the surface mixed layer of waters downstream of South Georgia through continuous recycling and biological uptake, supplying the large downstream phytoplankton blooms.

Seasonal environmental changes are extreme in polar regions, however MPA planning in East Antarctica relies mostly on species' summer distribution only. Thirteen Adelie penguins were tracked from Ile des Petrels (Terre Adelie), and their seasonal distribution and behaviour were compared to the proposed "D'Urville Sea-Mertz" MPA. During the phase of high food-demand preceding moult, penguins used mostly (68.4%) this proposed area. However, following autumnal sea ice extension, penguins migrated north-westwards: overall, 73% of their locations were outside the MPA proposal, and this was up to > 99% during winter (in July), the season when penguins maximized their dive depth and time (August and September, respectively). This study thus supports the proposal of implementing a "krill no-take zone" policy in this MPA, in line with the pre-moult foraging of these krill predators in this area. Further protection of the year-round habitats of migratory Adelie penguins could be achieved by inter-connecting the East Antarctic MPA proposals along the ice edge during winter, thereby mirroring the ecosystem's seasonal dynamics.																	0308-597X	1872-9460				NOV	2019	109								103692	10.1016/j.marpol.2019.103692							WOS:000497592800014

THE CERTAINTY OF UNCERTAINTY IN MARINE CONSERVATION AND WHAT TO DO ABOUT IT	BULLETIN OF MARINE SCIENCE												The confounding effects of difficult sampling and dynamic systems make uncertainty the norm for managers of marine ecosystems. Thus managers need approaches that use relatively small amounts of information and account for a wide suite of biological and physical influences. Here we use a case study approach to review the use of several possible techniques for making decisions about marine ecosystems despite uncertainty. We describe the use of expert judgment in the rebuilding plans for data-poor US fisheries, models to manage the krill fishery in the Southern Ocean to account for both the impacts of climate change and the resource needs of krill predators, an integrated risk assessment framework to prioritize shark management in the Atlantic Ocean despite severe data limitations, and models to account for climate impacts on salmonid populations in California. Through this review, we show that with limited information, managers can use models to explore how highly variable systems might respond to management options under different scenarios. Expert judgment can help shape the assumptions that form the basis for those models and propose sensible boundaries within which management options can be developed. A weight of evidence approach can take advantage of small amounts of information from multiple sources, including models and expert judgment.

Thermal constraints on the respiration and excretion rates of krill, Euphausia hanseni and Nematoscelis megalops, in the northern Benguela upwelling system off Namibia	AFRICAN JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE												Rates of respiration and ammonia excretion of Euphausia hanseni and Nematoscelis megalops were determined experimentally at four temperatures representative of conditions encountered by these euphausiid species in the northern Benguela upwelling environment. The respiration rate increased from 7.7 mu mol O-2 h(-1) g(ww)(-1) at 5 degrees C to 18.1 mu mol O-2 h(-1) g(ww)(-1) at 20 degrees C in E. hanseni and from 7.0 mu mol O-2 h(-1) g(ww)(-1) (5 degrees C) to 23.4 mu mol O-2 h(-1) g(ww)(-1) (20 degrees C) in N. megalops. The impact of temperature on oxygen uptake of the two species differed significantly. Nematoscelis megalops showed thermal adaptations to temperatures between 5 degrees C and 10 degrees C (Q(10) = 1.9) and metabolic constraint was evident at higher temperatures (Q(10) = 2.6). In contrast, E. hanseni showed adaptations to temperatures of 10-20 degrees C (Q(10) = 1.5) and experienced metabolic depression below 10 degrees C (Q(10) = 2.6). Proteins were predominantly metabolised by E. hanseni in contrast to lipids by N. megalops. Carbon demand of N. megalops between 5 and 15 degrees C was lower than in E. hanseni versus equal food requirements at 20 degrees C. It is concluded that the two species display different physiological adaptations, based on their respective temperature adaptations, which are mirrored in their differential vertical positioning in the water column.

Temporal changes in abundances of large calanoid copepods in the Scotia Sea: comparing the 1930s with contemporary times	POLAR BIOLOGY												To investigate whether impacts of reported climate change in the Antarctic marine environment have affected mesozooplankton populations, we compared the summertime abundances of four species of large calanoid copepods from samples taken during the Discovery Investigations (1926-1938) and contemporary times (1996-2013). Discovery samples were obtained using an N70V closing net fished vertically through three depth horizons encompassing the top 250 m of the water column, whereas contemporary samples were obtained using a Bongo net fished vertically through 200-0 m. Data from a previous study comparing catch efficiencies of the two nets were used to generate calibration factors which were applied to the N70V abundances. Following further corrections for net depth differences and seasonal biases in sampling frequency, three of the four species, Calanoides acutus, Rhincalanus gigas and Calanus simillimus, were found to be between similar to 20-55% more abundant in contemporary times than they were 70 years ago. Calanus propinquus was marginally more abundant in the Discovery era. These results were robust to sensitivity analyses for the net calibration factor, seasonal bias and net depth corrections. Although near-surface ocean temperatures within the Scotia Sea have increased by up to 1.5 A degrees C during the last 70 years, we conclude that the most likely causes of increased copepod abundances are linked to changes in the food-web. In particular, we discuss the reported decrease in krill abundance in the South Atlantic that has potentially increased the amount of food available to copepods while at the same time decreasing predator pressure.

Sea-ice cover differed markedly between years, with apparent effects on cetacean distribution. No ice was present until late June in 2001, while the previous winter sea ice never fully retreated (> 30% cover) during the 2002 or 2003 summer, thus increasing the proportion of thicker and more complex ice, including multi-year floes. Humpback (237 sightings; 537 individuals) and minke (103 sightings: 267 individuals) whales were the most commonly detected species. Data from seven comparable cruises were used to identify habitat for minke and humpback whales over five geographically distinct spatial divisions in the study area. In all years, both species were predominantly found in near coastal habitat, particularly in the fjords where complex habitat likely concentrated prey. In 2002 and 2003 the presence of sea ice provided additional feeding habitat, and the numbers of minkes (in winter) and humpbacks (late summer and autumn) in the area doubled compared with 2001. Humpbacks in particular were concentrated at the ice boundaries during late summer and autumn, while minke numbers increased in the winter that followed and occupied ice-covered areas along the entire shelf edge. Important resource sites for these species are mainly located in near-coastal areas and are used in all years, but when ice margins exist and intersect with resource sites they attract much larger numbers of animals due to the dynamics between sea ice and prey.

A total of 461 trawl samples were collected during seven seasonal cruises. A total of 17 out of 38 fish species were found to ingest T. gaudichaudii. This amphipod was a main prey item in five of these species, showing high values of alimentary index: Seriolella porosa (99.9%), Macruronus magellanicus (68.8%), Micromesistius australis (59.1%). Patagonotothen ramsayi (48.6%), and Merluccius hubbsi (10.9%). The contribution of T. gaudichaudii, in weight, to their summer diet was 60%, on average. This contribution was minimal in winter and maximal in summer. Fisheries studies have indicated that these five species, mainly M. magellanicus, account for almost 85% of the fish biomass in the area. Although the remaining 15% did not feed heavily on T. gaudichaudii, they are known to prey on the main hyperiid predators. Our study shows that T. gaudichaudii contributes greatly, both directly and indirectly, to supporting the fish community. We thus proposed that T. gaudichaudii plays a key role as a "wasp-waist" species in the sub-Antarctic region, similar to that of krill in Antarctic waters, channeling the energy flow and enabling a short and efficient food chain.

Rapid warming of the ocean around South Georgia, Southern Ocean, during the 20th century: Forcings, characteristics and implications for lower trophic levels	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART I-OCEANOGRAPHIC RESEARCH PAPERS												The Southern Ocean is known to have warmed considerably during the second half of the 20th century but there are few locations with data before the 1950s. In addition, assessments of change in this region are hampered by the strong seasonal bias in sampling, with the vast majority of data collected during the austral summer. However, oceanographic measurements near South Georgia span most of the last century, and we here consider almost year-round data from this location over an 81-year period (1925-2006). We observe significant warming between the early and late 20th century, with differential warming between summer and winter months and an indication that late 20th century summer temperatures peaked similar to 6 days earlier. To quantify the long-term warming trend in this highly variable data, a mixed model utilising a Residual Maximum Likelihood (REML) method was used. Over the 81-year period, a mean increase of similar to 0.9 degrees C in January and similar to 2.3 degrees C in August was evident in the top 100 m of the water column. Warming diminished below 100 m and approached 0 at 200 m. Thus the long-term warming around South Georgia is substantial-more so than documented previously for the circumpolar warming of the Southern Ocean. We examine potential causal effects of this trend, including local atmospheric and cryospheric change, the influence of upstream waters and the role of coupled modes of climate variability such as El Nino/Southern Oscillation and the Southern Annular Mode (SAM). It is likely that all of these play a part in the observed temperature increase. However, the role of the SAM is strongly indicated, via its likely role in the circumpolar warming trend in the Southern Ocean, and also by the atypical response of the South Georgia region to changes in heat fluxes associated with the SAM. Furthermore. the combination of a regional decline in ice extent and strong upstream warming likely explains a significant part of the strong seasonal variation apparent in the warming trend. In addition, we consider the implications that long-term warming has for South Georgia's lower trophic levels. For Euphausia superba, at their northern limit, we find a significant negative relationship between summer South Georgia water temperatures and mean summer density of E superba across the southwest Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean. Simple abundance and growth rate relationships with our long-term temperature data appear to show declining habitat suitability for E superba. In contrast, the warming trend is likely to favour other macro- and mesozooplankton species that occupy the more northerly parts of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current, and it is likely to promote phytoplankton growth.

A method for estimating colony sizes of Ad,lie penguins using remote sensing imagery	POLAR BIOLOGY												Ad,lie penguins (Pygoscelis adeliae) are important predators of krill (Euphausia spp.) and Antarctic silverfish (Pleuragramma antarctica) during summer, are a key indicator of the status of the Southern Ocean ecosystem, and are therefore a focal species for the Committee for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR) Ecosystem Monitoring Program. The ability to monitor the population size of species potentially affected by Southern Ocean fisheries, i.e., the Ad,lie penguin, is critical for effective management of those resources. However, for several reasons, direct estimates of population size are not possible in many locations around Antarctica. In this study, we combine high-resolution (0.6 m) satellite imagery with spectral analysis in a supervised classification to estimate the sizes of Ad,lie penguin breeding colonies along Victoria Land in the Ross Sea and on the Antarctic Peninsula. Using satellite images paired with concurrent ground counts, we fit a generalized linear mixed model with Poisson errors to predict the abundance of breeding pairs as a function of the area of current-year guano staining identified in the satellite imagery. Guano-covered area proved to be an effective proxy for the number of penguins residing within. Our model provides a robust, quantitative mechanism for estimating the breeding population size of colonies captured in imagery and identifies terrain slope as a significant component influencing apparent nesting density. While our high-resolution satellite imagery technique was developed for the Ad,lie penguin, these principles are directly transferrable to other colonially nesting seabirds and other species that aggregate in fixed localities.																	0722-4060	1432-2056				APR	2014	37	4					507	517		10.1007/s00300-014-1451-8							WOS:000332770800006

Oceanographic data were taken from the SCORPIO (May-June 1967), PIQUERO (May-June 1969), and KRILL (June 1974) cruises. Vertical sections of temperature, salinity, sigma(theta), dissolved oxygen, nitrate, nitrite, phosphate, and silicate were used to analyze the water column structure. Five water masses were identified in the zone through T-S diagrams: Subantarctic Water, Subtropical Water, Equatorial Subsurface Water, Antarctic Intermediate Water, and Pacific Deep Water. Their proportions in the sea water mixture are calculated using the mixing triangle method. Vertical sections were used to describe the geographical distributions of the water mass cores in the upper 1500 m. Several characteristic oceanographic features in the study area were analyzed: the shallow salinity minimum displacement towards the equator, the equatorial subsurface salinity maximum associated with a dissolved oxygen minimum zone and a high nutrient content displacement towards the south, and the equatorward intermediate Antarctic salinity minimum associated with a dissolved oxygen maximum. The nitrate deficit generated in the denitrification area off Peru and northern Chile is proposed as a conservative chemical tracer for the Equatorial Subsurface Waters off the coast of Chile, south of 25 degrees S.

Uncertainty and natural variability in the ecological footprint of fisheries: A case study of reduction fisheries for meal and oil	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS					Academic Sessions of the Footprint Forum on State of the Art in Ecological Footprint - Theory and Applications	JUN 07-12, 2010	Univ Siena, Ecodynam Grp, Colle Val dElsa, ITALY	Global Footprint Network	Univ Siena, Ecodynam Grp			It is well understood that measurements of ecological footprint and many other ecological indicators are associated with varying degrees of uncertainty, yet imprecision in ecological footprint results is rarely assessed or communicated. We calculated the marine portion of the ecological footprint of products derived from five reduction fisheries: Peruvian anchovy (Engraulis ringens), Atlantic herring (Clupea harengus), Gulf menhaden (Brevoortia patron us), blue whiting (Micromesistius poutassou) and Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba). Monte Carlo analysis was used to measure the imprecision in marine footprint measurements resulting from multiple sources of uncertainty and natural variability in input parameters, and to determine the degree to which imprecision affects our ability to draw meaningful conclusions when comparing products sourced from different fisheries on the basis of ecological footprint. Gulf menhaden and Antarctic krill were found to have the smallest marine footprints, while blue whiting was found to have the largest. Results show that there is much uncertainty associated with marine footprint calculations and that the most significant drivers of this imprecision are uncertainty and natural variability regarding measurements of trophic level and trophic interactions. Marine footprint is highly correlated with trophic level, and clear differences can be seen when comparing species of very different trophic levels. However, comparisons of products derived from species' with similar trophic levels are less likely to provide conclusive results. The choice of mass, protein or energy content as the basis of comparison was also considered and was found to influence the results, particularly when comparing species with similar trophic levels. While it is likely that imprecision of marine footprint measurements of fishery-derived products will remain high, technological improvements and a better understanding of marine ecosystem dynamics may make future studies more precise.

Haulout patterns revealed the seals' clear preference for diving during darkness and hauling out onto sea ice during daylight. Seals did not necessarily haul out every day; individual seals hauled out on 80-100% of days during the study period. Four general dive types were identified: 1) traveling dives, 2) foraging dives, 3) crepuscular foraging dives, and 4) exploratory dives. Nearly continual diving occurred for extended periods (about 16 h) nightly, with one individual diving up to 44 h without interruption. Foraging dives occurring during crepuscular periods were deeper than those made during the darkest hours. The authors suggest that the distinct diel pattern of dive timing and depth may be related to possible predator avoidance behavior by the seals' principal prey, Antarctic Krill.																	0722-4060					NOV	1992	12	6-7					635	644									WOS:A1992JY25600009

Zooplankton biomass and metabolism in the frontal zones of the Bransfield Strait, Antarctica	JOURNAL OF MARINE SYSTEMS												Biomass, abundance, gut fluorescence and electron transfer system (ETS) activity of zooplankton have been studied in the Bransfield Strait (Antarctic Peninsula). Two well-defined frontal systems were observed: (1) the so-called Peninsula front between the Transitional Bellingshausen Water (TBW) and Transitional Weddell Waters (TWW); and (2) the Bransfield front related to the Bransfield Gravity Current flowing northeastward along the slope of the South Shetland Islands. As expected, a typical pattern of plankton distribution was observed with higher phyto- and mesozooplankton in the TBW. However, our more detailed study of the Peninsula front between the TBW and TWW showed the sinking of phytoplankton and a higher abundance of large copepods on the TBW side of the front while krill and small copepods were observed on the opposite side, in the TWIN. Ageostrophic secondary circulation around the front supported a striking food web at both sides of the front. It is suggested that this pattern drives a relatively important flux of carbon, due to the sinking of phytoplankton and the production of fast sinking fecal pellets by large copepods and krill.

J	Everson, I				Everson, I			Consideration of major issues in ecosystem monitoring and management	CCAMLR SCIENCE												This paper outlines the requirements of an ecosystem approach to the management of Southern Ocean resources and highlights the need for information on harvested and dependent species, their interactions and the manner in which their populations vary naturally. Large-scale interactions are catered for in the Krill Yield Model (KYM). Smaller-scale interactions centre around three main categories: the availability of krill, variation in vital rates of the dependent species and the overlap between commercial fishing and predator foraging. The CCAMLR Ecosystem Monitoring Program (CEMP) provides a good framework within which to investigate krill availability. Vital rates can be investigated directly and also by means of CEMP The overlap between fishing and predator foraging is being monitored. A mechanism for bringing these various components together as an ecosystem approach to management is discussed.																	1023-4063						2002	9						213	232									WOS:000179438500015

Genetic monitoring of open ocean biodiversity: An evaluation of DNA metabarcoding for processing continuous plankton recorder samples	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY RESOURCES												DNA metabarcoding is an efficient method for measuring biodiversity, but the process of initiating long-term DNA-based monitoring programmes, or integrating with conventional programs, is only starting. In marine ecosystems, plankton surveys using the continuous plankton recorder (CPR) have characterized biodiversity along transects covering millions of kilometres with time-series spanning decades. We investigated the potential for use of metabarcoding in CPR surveys. Samples (n = 53) were collected in two Southern Ocean transects and metazoans identified using standard microscopic methods and by high-throughput sequencing of a cytochrome c oxidase subunit I marker. DNA increased the number of metazoan species identified and provided high-resolution taxonomy of groups problematic in conventional surveys (e.g., larval echinoderms and hydrozoans). Metabarcoding also generally produced more detections than microscopy, but this sensitivity may make cross-contamination during sampling a problem. In some samples, the prevalence of DNA from large plankton such as krill masked the presence of smaller species. We investigated adding a fixed amount of exogenous DNA to samples as an internal control to allow determination of relative plankton biomass. Overall, the metabarcoding data represent a substantial shift in perspective, making direct integration into current long-term time-series challenging. We discuss a number of hurdles that exist for progressing DNA metabarcoding from the current snapshot studies to the requirements of a long-term monitoring programme. Given the power and continually increasing efficiency of metabarcoding, it is almost certain this approach will play an important role in future plankton monitoring.

Six fledglings departed from Bechervaise Island near Mawson station (67degrees 35' S, 62degrees 49' E) during late February of 1996 and 1997 and were tracked for up to 5 mo before transmissions stopped. The 7th fledgling left Magnetic Island near Davis station (68degrees 33' S, 77degrees 54' E) in February 1995 and was tracked for 32 d. All fledglings travelled northward initially, then westward along the edge of the fast ice or in the pack-ice, Fledglings had travelled between 536 and 1931 km to the west of their natal colonies by the time transmissions ceased. Adult Adelie penguins were tracked between March and October 1998, following completion of their annual moult at Bechervaise Island. Instruments were set to transmit for 2 h every 10th day over the first 5 mo and 1 d in 4 thereafter. Adult birds travelled westward until July, after which time they moved north within the expanding pack-ice into known areas of high krill concentration before returning eastward toward their breeding sites. Penguin movements over the winter months were closely related to those of sea ice in the region. Ice motion patterns were in turn influenced by gyral oceanic current systems and wind. We propose that large gyral oceanic systems provide a means, for Adelie penguins to reduce costs of transport as they travel into regions of high productivity during winter and return to their breeding colonies in spring.																	0171-8630						2003	248						267	278		10.3354/meps248267							WOS:000181769500021						
J	Huntley, ME; Zhou, M				Huntley, ME; Zhou, M			Influence of animals on turbulence in the sea	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												Analysis of data on the hydrodynamics of swimming by 100 species, ranging in body mass (M) from bacteria to blue whales, leads to a model of animal-induced turbulence in the ocean. Swimming speeds and Reynolds number (Re) are strongly correlated with body mass, both at typical cruising speeds and at escape speeds associated with predator-prey interactions. We find that animals operating at Re > 1000 typically form schools that are concentrated by many orders of magnitude above their average abundance. We calculate the rate of kinetic energy production by 11 representative species of schooling animals ranging in size from euphausiids to whales, and find it to be of the order of 10(-5) W kg(-1), regardless of animal size. Animal-induced turbulence is comparable in magnitude to rates of turbulent energy dissipation (epsilon) that result from major storms. The horizontal length scale (10 to 1000 m) of energy production rate by animal schools is comparable to the observed fine-scale variability in epsilon. We present detailed case studies of 4 species -Atlantic bluefin tuna, Norwegian herring, northern anchovy and Antarctic krill -all of which have schooling behavior that places them within the zone of maximum seasonal stratification where their energy production rate would be 3 to 4 orders of magnitude greater than the background average rate of turbulent energy dissipation.

Lipid composition showed wax esters and triacylglycerols as main neutral lipids for T macrura and E. vallentini respectively. Allometric relationships between lipid class and total lipids indicated that changes in total lipids were size dependent and mainly related to wax esters in T macrura and polar lipids (both phosphatidylcholine or PC and phosphatidylethanolamine or PE) in E. vallentini. No difference in lipid composition could be shown for mate and female E. vallentini, while sampling location, developmental stage and sex were significantly influential in T macrura. In this latter species wax esters displayed relatively similar fatty acid and alcohol composition in both juvenile and female stages, whereas a striking difference could be seen between females and juveniles in terms of polar lipids with a very low PE content in females. Male and female E. vallentini showed little differences in fatty acid structure with the exception of PC in females, which were low in 22:6n-3. The trophic status of these two species was established using multivariate discriminant analysis, which indicated for E. vallentini a degree of omnivory similar to E. superba, while these T macrura appeared more omnivorous than individuals collected in other areas of the Southern Ocean. Clustering of polar lipid composition suggested a link between differences in PC fatty acid and the post-spawn stage of the female of E. vallentini collected. The same probably applies for the changes in PE recorded for T macrura females.																	0954-1020					DEC	2003	15	4					463	475		10.1017/S0954102003001573							WOS:000187366600008

Decadal shift in foraging strategy of a migratory southern ocean predator	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY												Rapid anthropogenic environmental change is expected to impact a host of ecological parameters in Southern Ocean ecosystems. Of critical concern are the consequences of these changes on the range of species that show fidelity to migratory destinations, as philopatry is hypothesized to help or hinder adaptation to climate change depending on the circumstances. Many baleen whales show philopatry to feeding grounds and are also capital breeders that meet migratory and reproductive costs through seasonal energy intake. Southern right whales (Eubalaena australis, SRWs) are capital breeders that have a strong relationship between reproductive output and foraging success. The population dynamics of South Africa's population of SRWs are characterized by two distinct periods: the 1990s, a period of high calving rates; and the late 2010s, a period associated with lowered calving rates. Here we use analyses of stable carbon (delta C-13) and nitrogen (delta N-15) isotope values from SRW biopsy samples (n = 122) collected during these two distinct periods to investigate foraging ecology of the South African population of SRWs over a time period coincident with the demographic shift. We show that South African SRWs underwent a dramatic northward shift, and diversification, in foraging strategy from 1990s to 2010s. Bayesian mixing model results suggest that during the 1990s, South African SRWs foraged on prey isotopically similar to South Georgia/Islas Georgias del Sur krill. In contrast, in the 2010s, South African SRWs foraged on prey isotopically consistent with the waters of the Subtropical Convergence, Polar Front and Marion Island. We hypothesize that this shift represents a response to changes in preferred habitat or prey, for example, the decrease in abundance and southward range contraction of Antarctic krill. By linking reproductive decline to changing foraging strategies for the first time in SRWs, we show that altering foraging strategies may not be sufficient to adapt to a changing ocean.

We report on an opportunistic observation via aerial survey, where hundreds of Adelie penguins were documented displaying nesting behaviours on fast ice 3 km off the coast of Cape Crozier, which is one of the largest colonies in the world. We counted 426 Adelie penguins engaging in behaviours of pair formation, spacing similarly to normal nest distributions and lying in divots in the ice that looked like nests. On our first visit, it was noticed that the guano stain was bright pink, consistent with krill consumption, but had shifted to green over the course of 2 weeks, indicating that the birds were fasting (a behaviour consistent with egg incubation). However, eggs were not observed. We posit four hypotheses that may explain the proximate causes of this behaviour and caution against future high-resolution satellite imagery interpretation due to the potential for confusing ice-nesting Adelie penguins with the presence of emperor penguin colonies.																	0954-1020	1365-2079				AUG	2019	31	4					189	194	PII S095410201900018X	10.1017/S095410201900018X							WOS:000478614300002

The Oceanography and Ecology of the Ross Sea	ANNUAL REVIEW OF MARINE SCIENCE, VOL 6	Annual Review of Marine Science											The continental shelf of the Ross Sea exhibits substantial variations in physical forcing, ice cover, and biological processes on a variety of time and space scales. Its circulation is characterized by advective inputs from the east and exchanges with off-shelf regions via the troughs along the northern portions. Phytoplankton biomass is greater there than anywhere else in the Antarctic, although nitrate is rarely reduced to levels below 10 mu mol L-1. Overall growth is regulated by irradiance (via ice at the surface and by the depths of the mixed layers) and iron concentrations. Apex predators reach exceptional abundances, and the world's largest colonies of Adelie and emperor penguins are found there. Krill are represented by two species (Euphausia superba near the shelf break and Euphausia crystallorophias throughout the continental shelf region). Equally important and poorly known is the Antarctic silverfish (Pleuragramma antarcticum), which is also consumed by most upper-trophic-level predators. Future changes in the Ross Sea environment will have profound and unpredictable effects on the food web.

Diets were defined for dominant zooplankton, micronekton, and flying seabird species and then aggregated by cluster analysis into feeding groups. Most zooplankton were omnivorous, feeding on phytoplankton, protozoans, and in some cases, small metazoans (copepods). Only two species were found to be exclusively herbivorous: Calanoides acutus and Rhincalanus gigas. Micronekton were carnivores with copepods being the dominant prey in all their diets. The midwater fish Electrona antarctica was the dominant food item in seven of the nine seabird species examined. Cephalopods, midwater decapod shrimps and carrion were also important in the diets of a few seabird species. Comparison (cluster analysis) of diets in spring with other seasons (winter, fall) indicated that over half the species examined (18 of 3 1) had similar diets in all seasons tested. The significant intraspecific shifts in diet that did occur were attributable to regional, seasonal, and interannual effects. A scheme is presented that describes the major energetic pathways through the open water ecosystem from phytoplankton to apex predators. At the base are phytoplankton and protozoans which are the principal food resource for the biomass copepods and krill. Krill and the biomass copepods are the principal forage of the midwater fish Electrona antarctica which, in turn, is the central diet component of flying seabirds as well as important food for the Antarctic fur seal and cephalopods. Krill are a major diet element for the fur seal and cephalopods, and the principal food of the minke whale.																	0722-4060					AUG	1993	13	6					389	397		10.1007/BF01681980							WOS:A1993LR72400004

Gut pigment levels varied from 1.7 to 40.6 ng chlorophyll a (Chl a) equiv..individual(-1) in adults and from 0.3 to 9.3 ng Chl a equiv..individual(-1) in juveniles. Highest levels were observed at the Subtropical Convergence (Chl a concentrations 0.4-0.6 mug.L-1) and minima in the area north of the Agulhas Front (Chl a concentrations 0.2-0.3 mug.L-1). Gut evacuation rates ranged between 0.59 and 0.96.h(-1). Gut pigment destruction levels were among the highest ever recorded in euphausiids, with 94.2-98.5% of total pigments ingested converted to nonfluorescing end products. Size-selectivity experiments with natural phytoplankton showed that E. spinifera ingests mainly cells in the 0.7- to 20-mum range. The grazing dynamics of this important species are compared with those of subantarctic (Euphausia vallentini) and Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba). Individual ingestion rates, estimated from the autotrophic component of its diet (2.78-4.46 mug Chl a equiv..individual(-1).day(-1)), were just sufficient to account for respiratory requirements. While E. spinifera is clearly able to ingest large amounts of heterotrophic prey, it is not known to what extent these contribute to its total energy budget.																	0706-652X	1205-7533				FEB	2001	58	2					273	281		10.1139/cjfas-58-2-273							WOS:000166837700005

The objective of this study was to investigate whether commercial Antarctic krill meal Euphausia superba or hydrolysates enzymatically produced from Pacific hake Merluccius productus could reverse the negative palatability effects of SBM inclusion in juvenile chinook salmon diets. Diets without SBM or with SBM and no added feed attractant were used as positive and negative control diets respectively. Incorporation of 2% krill meal or Alcalase (R)-produced hydrolysates into SBM-containing diets (20% of dry matter by isonitrogenous replacement of fishmeal) significantly (P<0.05) increased feed intake, feed utilization, fish weight gain and thermal growth coefficient during a 5-week trial. Nevertheless, the negative effects on fish performance incurred by dietary inclusion of 20% SBM could not be fully reversed, indicating that most of those effects were likely unrelated to palatability. This study demonstrates the potential for using Pacific hake hydrolysates as a dietary feed attractant for salmonid diets, and supports the need for further research to optimize its application for ideal fish performance.

Stable isotopes reveal regional heterogeneity in the pre-breeding distribution and diets of sympatrically breeding Pygoscelis spp. penguins	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												While the foraging ecology of the Adelie penguin Pygoscelis adeliae and gentoo penguin P. papua has been well studied, little is known on the distribution and diet of these species outside the breeding season. In the present study we used stable carbon (delta C-13) and nitrogen (delta N-15) isotope analyses of eggshells to examine the pre-breeding diets and foraging habitats of female Adelie and gentoo penguins from 23 breeding colonies along the eastern and western Antarctic Peninsula (AP), South Shetland Islands, and South Orkney Islands, in 2006. Adelie penguin eggshells from the eastern AP, South Shetland Islands, and South Orkney Islands shared similar isotopic signatures and were significantly lower in both delta C-13 and delta N-15 values than eggshells from birds breeding along the western AP. This result suggests that Adelie penguin populations that are geographically separated during the breeding season by the Adelie 'gap,' a 400 km region in the western AP devoid of breeding Adelie penguins, also inhabit geographically distinct habitats during the late winter prior to the breeding season. To a lesser degree, gentoo penguin eggshell isotope values also varied across breeding colonies, which likely reflects local scale variation in their near-shore foraging grounds. Furthermore, unlike the breeding period when krill (primarily Euphausia superba) dominates penguin diets in these regions, our findings suggest that fish and/or other high trophic-level prey species comprise a significant portion (46.8 to 62.9%) of female Adelie and gentoo penguin diets prior to breeding.

However, their use by the upper trophic levels of ecosystems remains unclear. A unique bio-physical dataset recorded by southern elephant seals reveals that East Antarctic polynyas are a key winter foraging habitat for male seals. During their post-moult trips from Isles Kerguelen to the Antarctic continental shelf, a total of 18 out of 23 seals visited 9 different polynyas, spending on average 25 +/- 20% (up to 75%) of their total trip time inside polynyas. Changes in seal foraging and diving behaviours are observed inside polynyas as compared to outside polynyas. Two polynya usages by seals are observed for the inactive and active polynya phases, pointing to different seasonal peaks in prey abundance. During the active polynya phase, we link seal foraging behaviour to changes in the physical stability of the water-column, which likely impact the seasonal biological dynamics within polynyas.

J	Gales, NJ; Fraser, WR; Costa, DP; Southwell, C				Gales, NJ; Fraser, WR; Costa, DP; Southwell, C			Do crabeater seals forage cooperatively?	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY												Crabeater seals are abundant pack-ice predators that feed almost exclusively on krill. They have a circumpolar distribution and are generally sighted hauled out on ice floes alone or in pairs. Here we report our observations of a sighting of 150-200 crabeater seals, which were synchronised in their diving and surfacing behaviour, along with a summary of similar observations from western Antarctica of large groups of crabeater seals in synchronous dive cycles. We report on the low frequency of sightings of such groups during Antarctic pack-ice seal surveys in eastern (Greater) Antarctica. We examine plausible hypotheses to explain these observations, and suggest this behaviour is likely to represent some form of cooperative foraging behaviour, whereby a net advantage in individual energy intake rates is conferred to each seal. Current research on crabeater seal foraging using satellite-linked dive recorders is unlikely to provide sufficiently fine-scale data to examine this hypothesis. Nor will this approach indicate if a seal is foraging with conspecifics. The use of remote or animal-borne camera systems is more likely to provide an insight into fine-scale foraging tactics, as well as the possible, occasional use of cooperative foraging strategies.

Three species were identified: Eukrohnia hamata (90.8%), Sagitta marri (6.4%) and S. gazellae (2.8%). Only juvenile stages were collected in the samples, a result related both to the type of sampling gear employed (mesh size: 100 mum) and the species' life-cycles. The vertical distributions showed that the juvenile stages of these species tended to aggregate at considerable depth (1000-500 m). It is postulated that this pattern may be related to the life-cycles of these species in association with seasonal Antarctic conditions, similar to the pattern postulated for krill and other polar crustaceans.																	0722-4060	1432-2056				JAN	2001	24	1					66	69		10.1007/s003000000181							WOS:000166077500011

Material laid down in otolith nuclei during early life showed (i) strong heterogeneity between the Antarctic Peninsula and South Georgia consistent with a population boundary, (ii) evidence of finer-scale heterogeneity between sampling areas on the Antarctic Peninsula, and (iii) similarity between the eastern and northern shelves of South Georgia, indicating a single, self-recruiting population there. Consistent with the otolith chemistry, simulations of the large-scale circulation predicted that particles released at depths of 100-300 m on the Antarctic Peninsula shelf during spring, corresponding to hatching of icefish larvae from benthic nests, are transported in the southern ACC, missing South Georgia but following trajectories along the southern Scotia Ridge instead. These results suggest that the timing of release and position of early life stages in the water column substantially influence the direction and extent of connectivity. Used in complement, the two techniques promise an innovative approach for generating and testing predictions to resolve early dispersal and connectivity of populations related to the physical circulation of oceanic systems.

Daily activity and minimum food requirements during winter for gentoo penguins (Pygoscelis papua) in the South Shetland Islands, Antarctica	POLAR BIOLOGY												Estimates of daily activity and consequent demand for food during winter are scarce for many polar seabirds, yet essential for assessing constraints on foraging effort, demand for food, and potential competition with local fisheries. We affixed archival temperature tags to gentoo penguins (Pygoscelis papua) from two colonies in the South Shetland Islands to measure the frequency, timing, and duration of foraging trips and to estimate minimum food requirements during winter. Foraging trip frequencies ranged from 0.85 to 1.0 trips day(-1) and were positively correlated with day length. Early winter foraging trips more closely matched day length than late winter foraging trips. The data suggest that individuals maximize foraging time during the early winter period, likely to recover body mass following the breeding season and molt. The more attenuated response of foraging trip durations to increasing day length in late winter may be related to differences in local resource availability or individual behaviors prior to the upcoming breeding season. Minimum food requirements also exhibited a seasonal cycle with a mid-winter minimum. On average, minimum food requirements were estimated at 0.70 +/- 0.12 kg day(-1). Extrapolated to the regional population of gentoo penguins, winter food requirements by gentoo penguins were equivalent to roughly 33% of annual krill catches by commercial fisheries in the South Shetland Island region over the past decade. Current expansion of the gentoo population and the krill fishery in the southern Scotia Sea warrants continued monitoring of gentoo penguins during winter.				, Jefferson/AAG-1702-2021	, Jefferson/0000-0002-3600-1414												0722-4060					OCT	2011	34	10					1579	1590		10.1007/s00300-011-1018-x							WOS:000297202300015

Substantial primary production in the land-remote region of the central and northern Scotia Sea	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY												The Scotia Sea area has high productivity relative to the Southern Ocean as a whole, but this displays strong latitudinal and longitudinal gradients. Elucidating the extent of these from a single cruise is problematic, given the high variability of bloom timing and location in this region. Therefore, this study used data from transects across the central Scotia Sea in spring, summer and autumn of 2006, 2008 and 2009, combined with satellite data, to obtain a larger-scale appreciation of the latitudinal contrasts in phytoplankton standing stock and primary production across the region. Concentrations of nitrate, phosphate and particularly silicic acid increased towards the south of the transect with the latter showing a step change at the Southern Antarctic Circumpolar Current Front (SACCF). Changes in seasonal nutrient concentrations indicated increasing phytoplankton uptake north of similar to 57 degrees S that peaked at similar to 53 degrees S in the Georgia Basin. Based on seasonal depletions of nitrate relative to phosphate, the highest relative nitrate uptake occurred northwest of South Georgia on the periphery of the Georgia Basin, indicating efficient nitrate use here due to iron-replete conditions. An integrative approach to examine these gradients was with the use of 10-year satellite climatology data. These showed that the lowest mean chlorophyll a (chl-a) values were in the central/northern Scotia Sea, but these were still substantial values, 67% of values within the Georgia Basin bloom. Cruise data on chl-a and on microplankton biomass from cell counts support this finding of substantial biomass in the central Scotia Sea; since these averaged half of values in the iron-fertilised bloom of the Georgia Basin downstream of South Georgia. Given that our transect was nearly 1000 km long and in parts was land remote with low iron concentrations, the relatively high production in the central and northern Scotia Sea is surprising. Iron levels may be maintained here by efficient recycling and irregular injections, possibly for example from dust deposition or shelf-derived inputs from the south. The moderate chl-a concentration across the mid-Scotia Sea and southwest of South Georgia reflect periodic, non-ice-associated blooms that occur in some years and not others. These may provide a connection between the large populations of krill inhabiting the northern and southern fringes of the Scotia Sea. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Green, JA; Boyd, IL; Woakes, AJ; Warren, NL; Butler, PJ				Green, JA; Boyd, IL; Woakes, AJ; Warren, NL; Butler, PJ			Behavioural flexibility during year-round foraging in macaroni penguins	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												Penguins are major consumers in the marine environment. However, like many top predators, very little information exists on their foraging behaviour outside the breeding season. We investigated the foraging behaviour of the macaroni penguin Eudyptes chrysolophus continuously for 2 consecutive years, from the end of December 2001. This allowed us to investigate whether foraging behaviour varied between sexes, years or phases of the annual cycle. Male penguins tended to dive deeper and longer than female penguins, but at a lower frequency, probably as a result of their larger body size. There was little variation in foraging behaviour between the 2 years studied, although neither year included a notable period of low Antarctic krill abundance. Diving behaviour varied substantially within years and general linear models were used to investigate this variability. In summary, all penguins tended to dive deeper, longer and more efficiently during their winter migration than during the summer breeding season. The penguins dived predominantly during daylight hours at all times of the year, but appeared to be more constrained by daylight during the short winter days. Several diving variables including dive duration, dive rate and amount of time spent diving were significantly related to day length and these associations were stronger during winter than summer. The macaroni penguin shows flexibility in its foraging behaviour as it adapts to differing constraints and challenges during its annual cycle.

How Do Polar Marine Ecosystems Respond to Rapid Climate Change?	SCIENCE												Climate change will alter marine ecosystems; however, the complexity of the food webs, combined with chronic undersampling, constrains efforts to predict their future and to optimally manage and protect marine resources. Sustained observations at the West Antarctic Peninsula show that in this region, rapid environmental change has coincided with shifts in the food web, from its base up to apex predators. New strategies will be required to gain further insight into how the marine climate system has influenced such changes and how it will do so in the future. Robotic networks, satellites, ships, and instruments mounted on animals and ice will collect data needed to improve numerical models that can then be used to study the future of polar ecosystems as climate change progresses.				; schofield, oscar/H-4169-2018	Meredith, Michael/0000-0002-7342-7756; schofield, oscar/0000-0003-2359-4131												0036-8075	1095-9203				JUN 18	2010	328	5985					1520	1523		10.1126/science.1185779							WOS:000278859200036	20558708

Time series analysis indicates that high levels of autocorrelation are present, with periodicity evident in temperature anomalies at lag periods of approximately 4 years. Cross-correlation analyses with data describing the El Nino regions of the Pacific indicate that variability at South Georgia reflects temperature fluctuations in the Pacific. This relationship is temporally separated, with the Pacific leading South Georgia by approximately 3 years and with the west Pacific showing the strongest cross correlation. Historic data describing the west Pacific show that patterns of variability have evolved through time and that the strong 4 year periodicity evident in recent years was not present in earlier records. The correlation between the west Pacific and South Georgia has also varied through time and the relationship is currently weaker than it has been over the past 19 years. The results are discussed in the context of a circumpolar precession of anomalies, transferring variability from the Pacific into the Atlantic.																	2169-9275	2169-9291				DEC 24	2002	108	C4							8075	10.1029/2000JC000299							WOS:000181232800001

Trophic position and foraging ecology of Ross, Weddell, and crabeater seals revealed by compound-specific isotope analysis	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												Ross seals Ommatophoca rossii are one of the least studied marine mammals, with little known about their foraging ecology. Research to date using bulk stable isotope analysis suggests that Ross seals have a trophic position intermediate between that of Weddell Leptonychotes weddellii and crabeater Lobodon carcinophaga seals. However, consumer bulk stable isotope values not only reflect trophic dynamics, but also variations in baseline isotope values, which can be substantial. We used compound-specific isotope analysis of amino acids (CSI-AA) to separate isotopic effects of a shifting baseline versus trophic structure on the foraging ecology of these ecologically important Antarctic pinnipeds. We found that Ross seals forage in an open ocean food web, while crabeater and Weddell seals forage within similar food webs closer to shore. However, isotopic evidence suggests that crabeater seals are likely following sea ice, while Weddell seals target productive areas of the continental shelf of West Antarctica. Our CSI-AA data indicate that Ross seals have a high trophic position equivalent to that of Weddell seals, contrary to prior conclusions from nitrogen isotope results on bulk tissues. CSI-AA indicates that crabeater seals are at a trophic position lower than that of Ross and Weddell seals, consistent with a krill-dominated diet. Our results redefine the view of the trophic dynamics and foraging ecology of the Ross seal, and also highlight the importance of quantifying baseline isotope variations in foraging studies.

By using a surface-forced ocean and sea-ice coupled model, we show that regional wind-driven ocean dynamics played a key role in driving these trends. In the East Pacific, the strengthening Southern Hemisphere (SH) westerlies in the region enhanced the Ekman upwelling of warm upper Circumpolar Deep Water and increased the northward Ekman transport of cold Antarctic surface water. The associated surface ocean warming south of 68 degrees S and the cooling north of 68 degrees S directly contributed to the retreat of sea-ice in warm seasons and the expansion in cold seasons, respectively. In the Atlantic, the poleward shifting SH westerlies in the region strengthened the northern branch of the Weddell Gyre, which in turn increased the meridional thermal gradient across it as constrained by the thermal wind balance. Ocean heat budget analysis further suggests that the strengthened northern branch of the Weddell Gyre acted as a barrier against the poleward ocean heat transport, and thus produced anomalous heat divergence within the Weddell Gyre and anomalous heat convergence north of the gyre. The associated cooling within the Weddell Gyre and the warming north of the gyre contributed to the expansion of sea-ice in warm seasons and the retreat in cold seasons, respectively.

Recruitment and body size in relation to temperature in juvenile Patagonian toothfish (Dissostichus eleginoides) at South Georgia	MARINE BIOLOGY												Recruitment variability in juvenile Patagonian toothfish (Dissostichus eleginoides), a commercially important, deepwater nototheniid fish, was examined at the sub-Antarctic island of South Georgia, South Atlantic. Data from 13 demersal trawl surveys conducted over a 20-year period were analysed. Abundance of the 1(+) juvenile fish cohort (13-15 month old dependent on survey date) was found to vary inter-annually and was found to be inversely correlated with the sea surface temperature (SST) conditions experienced by adults prior to spawning. Environmental temperatures experienced by toothfish eggs and larvae were not significantly correlated with juvenile density. The mean length of 1(+) fish attained after 13-15 months was higher in years of high juvenile abundance and was significantly inversely correlated with SST in the summer prior to adult spawning. Trends in toothfish recruitment variability mirrored those previously observed in a range of krill-dependent land-based predators at South Georgia for whom non-seasonal, large-scale climatic events such as El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) are considered the most likely underlying drivers of variability in breeding success. The drivers of recruitment variability in toothfish are not fully understood but a range of possible mechanisms are considered. A better understanding of recruitment variability holds great interest for fisheries managers and could be used refine forecasts of years of good or poor recruitment for the toothfish fishery at South Georgia.				, Martin/ABE-6728-2020; Collins, Martin A/J-8560-2017													0025-3162	1432-1793				OCT	2008	155	5					493	503		10.1007/s00227-008-1047-3							WOS:000259276300004

Seabird species assemblages reflect hydrographic and biogeographic zones within Drake Passage	POLAR BIOLOGY												Drake Passage, extending from the southern tip of South America to the northern Antarctic Peninsula, is a dynamic oceanographic region with well-defined habitats delineated by the three strong frontal jets of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC). Here, we describe seabird species distribution patterns across Drake Passage and test the hypothesis that species assemblages broadly reflect physical characteristics of the hydrographic fronts. Strip-transect seabird surveys were conducted between Tierra del Fuego and the South Shetland Islands (700 km track line) during January-March (austral summer) over 14 years (48 crossings). Locations of the latitudinally variable fronts were assessed using in situ shipboard data on sea surface temperature and salinity; areas of high variance were used to indicate frontal features. We quantified five distinct species assemblages that correspond to biogeographic regions and relate to the positions of the Sub-Antarctic Front, Polar Front and ACC Southern Front. Dense seabird concentrations coincided with regions characterized by highly variable sea surface temperature and salinity, suggesting that associated species assemblages reflect the mesoscale hydrographic surface as indicated by sea surface conditions.																	0722-4060	1432-2056				MAR	2015	38	3					381	392		10.1007/s00300-014-1594-7							WOS:000350040500009

The delta-C-13 values of these animals ranged from -33.2 to -23.9 parts per thousand, and a significant negative logarithmic relationship was observed between these values and biomass C/N. This implies that the relative proportion of carbon-rich C-13-depleted lipid in these animals significantly influenced the delta-C-13 of their bulk biomass. No such relationship with C/N is evident with respect to biomass delta-N-15 where values ranged from -1.2 to +7.3 parts per thousand. This spread of values reflects a wide diversity of food sources and trophic positions among the species analyzed. Isotopic abundances within krill Euphausia superba varied with individual length, apparently reflecting dietary changes during growth.

J	Favero, M; Silva, MP				Favero, M; Silva, MP			How important are pelagic preys for the kelp gull during chick-rearing at the South Shetland Islands?	POLAR BIOLOGY												An analysis of pellets regurgitated indicated adult kelp gulls (Larus dominicanus) on the South Shetland Islands consumed predominantly intertidal prey, whereas previous studies at Antarctic Peninsula sites have reported kelp gulls consuming predominantly pelagic species. The pellets collected at Nelson Island during the chick-rearing period indicated that the limpet Nacella concinna was their most frequent prey, followed by carrion, gammariids, snails and krill. Fish were scarcely represented. Also, regurgitated stomach contents of chicks showed that limpets and carrion were the most frequent food items, accounting for 70% of the mass. However, gammariids were particularly important by number. Significant differences were observed in the overall comparison of the diet as reflected by the two sampling methods. In general, the importance of pelagic prey was negligible when compared to intertidal or scavenged prey. Our results differ greatly from those reported for the Antarctic Peninsula, where chicks were almost exclusively fed with the pelagic fish Pleuragramma antarcticum. These differences could be related to the abundance of pelagic resources in southernmost latitudes, and/or to the presence of more extensive intertidal foraging areas at the South Shetland Islands.

Experimental measurements in krill were performed at Stn 18 (in 2007 and 2008) and northern Chile (2010) in order to estimate vital rates for use in E. mucronata secondary production calculation at Stn 18. Coastal upwelling intensity was the main oceanographic process found to control E. mucronata population abundance and biomass production on seasonal and inter-annual time scales. Spawning peaks and population structure indicate that E. mucronata produces at least 2 generations per year. The main spawning period occurs during the austral spring when phytoplankton concentration is high. A second, less intense spawning period occurs at the end of the austral summer and early autumn. E. mucronata had a mean biomass of 100 mg C m(-3) and an integrated annual secondary production of 2432 mg C m(-3) yr(-1), with an overall production/biomass ratio (P/B) ratio of 24. In May 2007, a maximum daily integrated biomass of 5 g C m(-3) and total daily secondary production of 63 mg C m(-3) d(-1) were observed. These estimates are considerably higher than those reported for other krill species in coastal upwelling regions. Multivariate analyses indicate that upwelling-favorable winds promote high E. mucronata biomass and secondary production, but higher abundance and biomass were found during the transition periods from upwelling to downwelling conditions. Results suggest that E. mucronata has a highly efficient behavioral strategy to attain high production rates and recover rapidly from potential offshore losses due to advective processes in a highly productive coastal upwelling ecosystem.

These extreme movements allow them to feed on swarms of euphausiids (krill) that occur seasonally in different regions, but they occasionally experience die-offs when availability of euphausiids or other prey is inadequate. During a coccolithophore bloom in the Bering Sea in 1997, hundreds of thousands of Short-tailed Shearwaters starved to death. One proposed explanation was that the calcareous shells of phytoplanktonic coccolithophores reduced light transmission, thus impairing visual foraging underwater. This hypothesis assumes that shearwaters feed entirely by vision (bite-feeding), but their unique bill and tongue morphology might allow nonvisual filter-feeding within euphausiid swarms. To investigate these issues. we developed simulation models of Short-tailed Shearwaters bite-feeding and filter-feeding underwater on the euphausiid Thysanoessa raschii. The visual (bite-feeding) model considered profiles of diffuse and beam attenuation of light in the Bering Sea among seasons. sites, and years with varying influence by diatom and coccolithophore blooms. The visual model indicated that over the huge range of densities in euphausiid swarms (tens to tens of thousands per cubic meter), neither light level nor prey density had appreciable effects on intake rate; instead, intake was severely limited by capture time and capture probability after prey were detected. Thus, for shearwaters there are strong advantages of feeding on dense swarms near the surface. where dive costs are low relative to fixed intake rate, and intake might be increased by filter-feeding. With minimal effects of light conditions, starvation of shearwaters during the coccolithophore bloom probably did not result from reduced visibility underwater after prey patches were found. Alternatively, turbidity from coccolithophores might have hindered detection of euphausiid swarms from the air.

Nyctiphanes simplex (Crustacea: Euphausiacea) temporal association of embryogenesis and early larval development with female molt and ovarian cycles	JOURNAL OF PLANKTON RESEARCH												Embryogenesis (single cell to twitching stage) and early larval stages (nauplius to calyptopis 3) internal morphology of the sac-spawning species Nyctiphanes simplex was investigated to explore its temporal association with gonad development and molt development cycles. Krill were collected and incubated shipboard in July 2007 and March 2010 in the Gulf of California. Cleavage patterns were similar to what is observed in broadcast-spawning species, suggesting a close phylogenetic consistency between krill species with distinct spawning strategies. Nyctiphanes simplex, like broadcast-spawning krill species, had eight Kranzzellen (K1K8) cells during the blastula stage. The gonad of ovigerous females with embryos in the cell division stage is in the multiplication stage (Stage I). From the nauplius stage, most females are in previtellogenesis (Stage II). Only females with metanauplii occasionally have gonads in vitellogenesis (Stage III). Gonad maturity (Stage IV) occurs only after the release of the embryos from the ovigerous sac. Females with an ovigerous sac were invariably at the intermolt stage, suggesting a precise synchronization among processes of molting, gonad development and embryo release to produce consecutive broods. Lipid and carbohydrate storage decreased exponentially throughout embryonic and early larval development, depending on their endogenous reserves. When metanauplii leave the ovigerous sac, they have low storage lipid (2) and carbohydrate (5). These proportions suggest a theoretically short period-of-no-return (2 days), when they transform into the first feeding stage (calyptopis 1).

Vertical fatty acid composition in the blubber of leopard seals and the implications for dietary analysis	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY												The analysis of blubber fatty acids (FAs) is a useful tool to infer diet of mammals that live in remote regions where year-round studies are difficult. The FA may not be distributed uniformly within the blubber, which can have implications for dietary predictive studies. The aim of this study was to determine the FA composition in the blubber core of the Antarctic leopard seal, Hydrurga leptonyx, and evaluate the potential implications of FA stratification for dietary analysis. The blubber cores of 24 seals were sub-sectioned into outer, middle and inner layers and their FA were compared to those of their potential prey species. A vertical variation in FA composition was found across the whole blubber core of the leopard seal. 17 FAs were found at greater than trace amounts (>0.5%) across all samples and the most abundant were: C18:1 omega 9, C16:1, C22:6 omega 3, C16:0 and C18:1 omega 7, which accounted for approximately 70% of the total FA. Almost all FAs had a continuous gradient through the blubber. Principal Component Analysis confirmed separation between inner and outer layers while the middle layer was a transition. The stratification of the leopard seal blubber was similar to the general pattern observed in a variety of marine species: monounsaturated FA (MUFA) dominated the three layers being more abundant in the outer layer, polyunsaturated (PUFA) and saturated FA (SFA) were more abundant in the inner layer. Polyunsaturated FAs are of dietary origin and SFAS are chemically inert so they can be used as a long-term reserve, which suggest that the inner layer is the site of deposition of the FA obtained from diet. The influence of prey on the composition of the leopard seals' blubber was clearer in the inner layer, although neither outer nor inner layers exactly matched the FA of the potential prey. This suggests that there are other components influencing the FA composition of this predator; therefore, in order to carry out dietary analysis it is important to consider the stratification of blubber and to use the inner layer, where the influence of diet is more evident. This has significant implications for sampling methods in the field. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Thr three highest acoustic frequencies delineate relative abundances of the euphausiid Meganyctiphanes norvegica while the 12-kHz frequency primarily reflects abundances of pelagic silver hake. Euphausiid populations derived from acoustics fluctuate by a factor of 20 combining both seasonal and inter-annual variation components. Acoustically derived euphausiid populations correlate significantly with both net-sampled euphausiid populations and acoustically derived silver hake abundances, but show no clear long-term (multi-year) trends. The correlation between Emerald Basin euphausiid and migratory pelagic fish abundances suggests the ecological influence of the Shelf Basin euphausiid stocks extends to the surrounding shelf areas.

Here, the extent to which three sympatric petrels (Antarctic and thin-billed prions, and blue petrel) from the subantarctic Kerguelen Islands modify their foraging ecology during molt was investigated using a combination of complementary tools, namely miniaturized saltwater immersion geolocators (GLS) and the isotopic method. Firstly, molting behavior was first characterized in the blue petrel, a reference species that is known to renew its plumage in autumn. GLS and feather stable isotopes (delta C-13 as a proxy of the birds foraging habitat) indicated that the post-breeding molt of blue petrel occurred in Antarctic waters. Importantly, activity recorders showed that molt was marked by a strong peak in time spent daily sitting on water, which thereafter declined to lower values during the remaining winter months. Secondly, the peak in time spent sitting on water was used as a proxy to characterize the contrasted molt strategies of the two prion species. As blue petrels demonstrated, thin-billed prions molted during the post breeding period in cold Antarctic waters where they fed primarily on low trophic level prey, most likely Antarctic krill (delta N-15 as a proxy of the birds' diet). By contrast, Antarctic prions presented an unexpected pre-breeding molt of longer duration that took place further north, in warm subtropical waters. Interestingly, the two Antarctic molting species, the blue petrel and thin-billed prion, renewed their plumage at the same time and within the same oceanic zone that is likely to be a previously undescribed hot spot of seabird diversity during the Austral autumn. The study contributes to a growing body of evidence that closely-related species exhibit various foraging strategies allowing ecological segregation and sheds new light on the poorly known critical molting stage of seabirds.																	2296-701X						2016	4								3	10.3389/fevo.2016.00003							WOS:000517761700003						
J	VANFRANEKER, JA				VANFRANEKER, JA			TOP PREDATORS AS INDICATORS FOR ECOSYSTEM EVENTS IN THE CONFLUENCE ZONE AND MARGINAL ICE-ZONE OF THE WEDDELL AND SCOTIA SEAS, ANTARCTICA, NOVEMBER 1988 TO JANUARY 1989 (EPOS LEG 2)	POLAR BIOLOGY												The pelagic summer distribution of Antarctic seabirds, seals and whales was studied in the marginal ice zone of the northwestern Weddell Sea from November 1988 to January 1989. In order to relate top predators to other components of the ecosystem studied simultaneously, their distribution is mainly described in terms of energy flow. Bird, seal, and probably also whale requirements were highest in ice-covered areas. There was no evidence of higher numbers of top predators along the ice edge: densities generally increased further into the ice. In the pack ice, combined energy requirements of top predators often amounted to about 200.000 kJ/day/km2, or about 45 kg fresh food, indicating high abundance and availability of prey under the ice. There was a lack of conformity between top predator abundance on the ice and abundance of other life in the water column below. In open water, bird requirements were generally less than 25.000 kJ/day/km2, seals were virtually absent and whales were distributed unevenly. Tubenosed birds concentrated along the outer ice edge in early summer but they moved north to open water during December, leaving the area of maximum phytoplankton biomass associated with the retreating ice edge. This pattern matched northward movements of krill swarms that may be related to changes in quality rather than quantity of phytoplankton stocks.																	0722-4060					APR	1992	12	1					93	102		10.1007/BF00239969							WOS:A1992HT73100011

Although sea Ice microalgal production is exceeded by phytoplankton production on an annual basis in most offshore regions of the Southern Ocean, blooms of sea ice algae differ considerably from the phytoplankton in terms of timing and distribution. Thus sea ice algae provide food resources for higher trophic level organisms in seasons and regions where water column biological production Is low or negligible. A flux of biogenic material from sea ice to the water column and benthos follows ice melt, and some of the algal species are known to occur in ensuing phytoplankton blooms. A review of algal species In pack ice and offshore plankton showed that dominance is common for three species: Phaeocystis antarctica, Fragilariopsis cylindrus and Fragilariopsis curta. The degree to which dominance by these species is a product of successional processes In sea Ice communities could be an important in determining their biogeochemical contribution to the Southern Ocean and their ability to seed blooms in marginal ice zones.																	0003-1569					FEB	2001	41	1					57	73		10.1668/0003-1569(2001)041[0057:TCOSIA]2.0.CO;2							WOS:000172505600006

Predatory zooplankton on the move: Themisto amphipods in high-latitude marine pelagic food webs	ADVANCES IN MARINE BIOLOGY, VOL 82	Advances in Marine Biology											Hyperiid amphipods are predatory pelagic crustaceans that are particularly prevalent in high-latitude oceans. Many species are likely to have co-evolved with soft-bodied zooplankton groups such as salps and medusae, using them as substrate, for food, shelter or reproduction. Compared to other pelagic groups, such as fish, euphausiids and soft-bodied zooplankton, hyperiid amphipods are poorly studied especially in terms of their distribution and ecology. Hyperiids of the genus Themisto, comprising seven distinct species, are key players in temperate and cold-water pelagic ecosystems where they reach enormous levels of biomass. In these areas, they are important components of marine food webs, and they are major prey for many commercially important fish and squid stocks. In northern parts of the Southern Ocean, Themisto are so prevalent that they are considered to take on the role that Antarctic krill play further south. Nevertheless, although they are around the same size as krill, and may also occur in swarms, their feeding behaviour and mode of reproduction are completely different, hence their respective impacts on ecosystem structure differ. Themisto are major predators of meso- and macrozooplankton in several major oceanic regions covering shelves to open ocean from the polar regions to the subtropics. Based on a combination of published and unpublished occurrence data, we plot out the distributions of the seven species of Themisto. Further, we consider the different predators that rely on Themisto for a large fraction of their diet, demonstrating their major importance for higher trophic levels such as fish, seabirds and mammals. For instance, T. gaudichaudii in the Southern Ocean comprises a major part of the diets of around 80 different species of squid, fish, seabirds and marine mammals, while T. libellula in the Bering Sea and Greenland waters is a main prey item for commercially exploited fish species. We also consider the ongoing and predicted range expansions of Themisto species in light of environmental changes. In northern high latitudes, sub-Arctic Themisto species are replacing truly Arctic, icebound, species. In the Southern Ocean, a range expansion of T. gaudichaudii is expected as water masses warm, impacting higher trophic levels and biogeochemical cycles. We identify the many knowlegde gaps that must be filled in order to evaluate, monitor and predict the ecological shifts that will result from the changing patterns of distribution and abundance of this important pelagic group.

Vertebrate records in polar sediments: Biological responses to past climate change and human activities	EARTH-SCIENCE REVIEWS												Biological responses to climate and environmental changes in remote polar regions are of increasing interest in global change research. Terrestrial and marine polar ecosystems have suffered from impacts of both rapid climate change and intense human activities, and large fluctuations in the population sizes of seabirds, seals, and Antarctic krill have been observed in the past decades. To understand the mechanisms driving these regime shifts in polar ecosystems, it is important to first distinguish the influences of natural forcing from anthropogenic activities. Therefore, investigations of past changes of polar ecosystems prior to human contact are relevant for placing recent human-induced changes within a long-term historical context. Here we focus our review on the fossil, sub-fossil, archaeological, and biogeochemical remains of marine vertebrates in polar sediments. These remains include well-preserved tissues such as bones, hairs and feathers, and biogeochemical markers and other proxy indicators, including deposits of guano and excrement, which can accumulate in lake and terrestrial sediments over thousands of years. Analyses of these remains have provided insight into both natural and anthropogenic impacts on marine vertebrates over millennia and have helped identify the causal agents for these impacts. Furthermore, land-based seabirds and marine mammals have been shown to play an important role as bio-vectors in polar environments as they transport significant amounts of nutrients and anthropogenic contaminants between ocean and terrestrial ecosystems.

Prey density and distribution drive the three-dimensional foraging strategies of the largest filter feeder	FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY												Despite their importance in determining the rate of both energy gain and expenditure, how the fine-scale kinematics of foraging are modified in response to changes in prey abundance and distribution remain poorly understood in many animal ecosystems. In the marine environment, bulk-filter feeders rely on dense aggregations of prey for energetically efficient foraging. Rorqual whales (Balaenopteridae) exhibit a unique form of filter feeding called lunge feeding, a process whereby discrete volumes of prey-laden water are intermittently engulfed and filtered. In many large rorqual species the size of engulfed water mass is commensurate with the whale's body size, yet is engulfed in just a few seconds. This filter-feeding mode thus requires precise coordination of the body and enlarged engulfment apparatus to maximize capture efficiency. Previous studies from whale-borne tags revealed that many rorqual species perform rolling behaviours when foraging. It has been hypothesized that such acrobatic manoeuvres may be required for efficient prey capture when prey manifest in small discrete patches, but to date there has been no comprehensive analysis of prey patch characteristics during lunge feeding events. We developed a null hypothesis that blue whale kinematics are independent of prey patch characteristics. To test this hypothesis, we investigated the foraging performance of blue whales, the largest filter-feeding predator and their functional response to variability in their sole prey source, krill using a generalized additive mixed model framework. We used a combination of animal-borne movement sensors and hydroacoustic prey mapping to simultaneously quantify the three-dimensional foraging kinematics of blue whales (Balaenoptera musculus) and the characteristics of targeted krill patches. Our analyses rejected our null hypothesis, showing that blue whales performed more acrobatic manoeuvres, including 180 degrees and 360 degrees rolling lunges, when foraging on low-density krill patches. In contrast, whales targeting high-density krill patches involved less manoeuvring during lunges and higher lunge feeding rates. These data demonstrate that blue whales exhibit a range of adaptive foraging strategies that maximize prey capture in different ecological contexts. Because first principles indicate that manoeuvres require more energy compared with straight trajectories, our data reveal a previously unrecognized level of complexity in predator-prey interactions that are not accounted for in optimal foraging and energetic efficiency models.

C.; Pillsbury, Finn C.; Rassweiler, Andrew; Schmitt, Russell J.; Sharma, Sapna			Analysis of abrupt transitions in ecological systems	ECOSPHERE												The occurrence and causes of abrupt transitions, thresholds, or regime shifts between ecosystem states are of great concern and the likelihood of such transitions is increasing for many ecological systems. General understanding of abrupt transitions has been advanced by theory, but hindered by the lack of a common, accessible, and data-driven approach to characterizing them. We apply such an approach to 30-60 years of data on environmental drivers, biological responses, and associated evidence from pelagic ocean, coastal benthic, polar marine, and semi-arid grassland ecosystems. Our analyses revealed one case in which the response (krill abundance) linearly tracked abrupt changes in the driver (Pacific Decadal Oscillation), but abrupt transitions detected in the three other cases (sea cucumber abundance, penguin abundance, and black grama grass production) exhibited hysteretic relationships with drivers (wave intensity, sea-ice duration, and amounts of monsoonal rainfall, respectively) through a variety of response mechanisms. The use of a common approach across these case studies illustrates that: the utility of leading indicators is often limited and can depend on the abruptness of a transition relative to the lifespan of responsive organisms and observation intervals; information on spatiotemporal context is useful for comparing transitions; and ancillary information from associated experiments and observations aids interpretation of response-driver relationships. The understanding of abrupt transitions offered by this approach provides information that can be used to manage state changes				Ohman, Mark D/C-8763-2009; Laney, Christine/B-7867-2010	Ohman, Mark D/0000-0001-8136-3695; Rassweiler, Andrew/0000-0002-8760-3888; Sharma, Sapna/0000-0003-4571-2768; Gorman, Kristen B./0000-0002-0258-9264; Laney, Christine/0000-0002-4944-2083												2150-8925					DEC	2011	2	12							129	10.1890/ES11-00216.1							WOS:000208811300001						
J	Reid, K; Croxall, JP; Prince, PA				Reid, K; Croxall, JP; Prince, PA			The fish diet of black-browed albatross Diomedea melanophris and grey-headed albatross D-chrysostoma at South Georgia	POLAR BIOLOGY												The fish component of the diet of black-browed and grey-headed albatrosses at South Georgia was investigated by intercepting 155 meals from adults arriving to feed chicks during February 1986 and 1994. Fish represented 30% and 72% by mass of the diet of black-browed albatrosses and 14% and 60% by mass of the diet of grey-headed albatrosses in 1986 and 1994 respectively. We determined the identity and quantified the contribution (by numbers, size and mass) of fish species mainly by using otoliths (54 representing 9 taxa and 57 representing 17 taxa in black-browed and grey-headed albatross samples respectively). For black-browed albatrosses in 1986 the main fish prey was Patagonotothen guntheri (77% of otoliths, 51% of estimated fish biomass) and a single large specimen of Icichthys australis (40% estimated biomass), whereas in 1994 Pseudochaenichthys georgianus was the main fish prey (57% of estimated biomass) with Magnisudis prionosa (30%) and Champsocephalus gunnari (12%) also making substantial contributions. Grey-headed albatross samples from 1986 were dominated by southern lampreys (40% by number, 79% of estimated biomass), lanternfish (32% of numbers, 9% by mass) and Patagonotothen guntheri (11% by mass); in 1994 Champsocephalus gunnari (42% by numbers, 24% by mass), Magnisudis prionosa (13% by number, 36% by mass), Muraenolepis microps (90% by number), Pseudochaemichthys georgianus (15% by mass) and lanternfish (18% by number but only 1% by mass) were the main prey. The importance of Patagonotothen guntheri to both species in 1986 and its absence in 1994 probably reflect albatrosses obtaining it from the commercial fishery, which was active in 1986 but closed in 1994. Otherwise the fish diet of black-browed albatrosses is dominated by krill-feeding fish, characteristic of the waters of the South Georgia shelf. In contrast, the grey-headed albatross diet comprises deeper water mesopelagic species, especially lanternfish, which reflect its affinity for the Antarctic Polar Frontal Zone and associated oceanic upwellings.																	0722-4060					AUG	1996	16	7					469	477									WOS:A1996VC92500002						
J	HUNTLEY, ME; NIILER, PP				HUNTLEY, ME; NIILER, PP			PHYSICAL CONTROL OF POPULATION-DYNAMICS IN THE SOUTHERN-OCEAN	ICES JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE												Horizontal advection is the single most important mechanism by which physics of the Southern Ocean exerts control on population dynamics of its resident zooplankton. Advection determines whether or not zooplankton will reside in food-poor areas (e.g. Antarctic Circumpolar Current) or in food-rich areas (e.g. coastal shelves and frontal zones); the shape and structure of advective features further determine the residence time of zooplankton in a given food regime. Advection per se thus bears directly on rates of growth, mortality, and reproduction. The intensity of advection on characteristic spatial scales in the Southern Ocean redistributes zooplankton to such a great degree that it utterly destroys the demographic integrity of populations. The spatial scale of advective features, determined by the internal Rossby radius, is much smaller in the Southern Ocean (order 5 km) than at lower latitudes. At the same time, the life cycle of Antarctic zooplankton is relatively long; copepods typically have a one-year life cycle, and that of krill is longer. A group of zooplankton that begins its life cycle as an identifiable population is subjected to the small-scale dispersive forces of advection for such a long time that by the time individual members reach maturity they will have been dispersed to such a great degree that they are no longer recognizable as a single population. We conclude that the nature of physical control of zooplankton population dynamics in the Southern Ocean calls into question the very concept of a population.

A protocol for a randomised controlled trial investigating the effect of increasing Omega-3 index with krill oil supplementation on learning, cognition, behaviour and visual processing in typically developing adolescents	BMJ OPEN												Introduction: The influence of n-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFA) supplementation on brain functioning is debated. Some studies have found positive effects on cognition in children with learning difficulties, elderly people with cognitive impairment and depression scores in depressed individuals. Other studies have found null or negative effects. Observational studies in adolescents have found positive associations between fish consumption (containing n-3 LCPUFAs) and academic achievement. However, intervention studies in typically developing adolescents are missing. Objective: The goal of this study is to determine the influence of increasing Omega-3 Index on cognitive functioning, academic achievement and mental wellbeing of typically developing adolescents. Methods and data analysis: Double-blind, randomised, placebo controlled intervention; 264 adolescents (age 13-15 years) attending lower general secondary education started daily supplementation of 400 mg eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid (EPA+DHA) in cohort I (n=130) and 800 mg EPA+DHA in cohort II (n=134) or a placebo for 52 weeks. Recruitment took place according to a low Omega-3 Index (<5%). The Omega-3 Index was monitored via a finger prick at baseline and after 3, 6 and 12 months. The supplement dose was adjusted after 3 months (placebo analogously) to reach an Omega-3 Index of 8-11%. At baseline, 6 and 12 months, a neuropsychological test battery, a number of questionnaires and a standardised math test (baseline and 12 months) were administered. School grades were collected. In a subsample, sleep quality and quantity data (n=64) and/or eye-tracking data (n=33) were collected. Ethics and dissemination: Food2Learn is performed according to Good Clinical Practice. All data collected are linked to participant number only. The results will be disseminated on group level to participants and schools. The results will be presented at conferences and published in peer-reviewed journals. The study is approved by the Medical Ethical Committee of Atrium-Orbis-Zuyd Hospital and is registered at the Netherlands Trial Register (NTR4082).

J	Arrigo, KR; Worthen, D; Schnell, A; Lizotte, MP				Arrigo, KR; Worthen, D; Schnell, A; Lizotte, MP			Primary production in Southern Ocean waters	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS												The Southern Ocean forms a link between major ocean basins, is the site of deep and intermediate water ventilation, and is one of the few areas where macronutrients are underutilized by phytoplankton. Paradoxically, prior estimates of annual primary production are insufficient to support the Antarctic food web. Here we present results from a primary production algorithm based upon monthly climatological phytoplankton pigment concentrations from the coastal zone color scanner (CZCS), Phytoplankton production was forced using monthly temperature profiles and a radiative transfer model that computed changes in photosynthetically usable radiation at each CZCS pixel location. Average daily productivity (g C m(-2) d(-1)) and total monthly production (Tg C month(-1)) were calculated for each of five geographic sectors (defined by longitude) and three ecological provinces (defined by sea ice coverage and bathymetry as the pelagic province, the marginal ice zone, and the shelf). Annual primary production in the Southern Ocean (south of 50 degrees S) was calculated to be 4414 Tg C yr(-1), 4-5 times higher than previous estimates made from in situ data. Primary production was greatest in the month of December (816 Tg C month(-1)) and in the pelagic province (contributing 88.6% of the annual primary production). Because of their small size the marginal ice zone (MIZ) and the shelf contributed only 9.5% and 1.8%, respectively, despite exhibiting higher daily production rates. The Ross Sea was the most productive region, accounting for 28% of annual production. The fourfold increase in the estimate of primary production for the Southern Ocean likely makes the notion of an "Antarctic paradox" (primary production insufficient to support the populations of Southern Ocean grazers, including krill, copepods, microzooplankton, etc.) obsolete.

J	BRINTON, E				BRINTON, E			DISTRIBUTION AND POPULATION STRUCTURES OF IMMATURE AND ADULT EUPHAUSIA-SUPERBA IN THE WESTERN BRANSFIELD STRAIT REGION DURING THE 1986-87 SUMMER	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART A-OCEANOGRAPHIC RESEARCH PAPERS												Interrelationships among body size, maturity state and spatial distribution in immature and adult Euphausia superba were examined through the course of the 1986-87 reproductive season in a region centered in western Bransfield Strait and extending northward into Drake Passage and southward into Gerlache Strait. During an initial (December to January) peak in production of phytoplankton and krill larvae in Gerlache Strait and adjacent parts of Bransfield Strait, so few post-larvae and adults were caught that the parent stock of those larvae could not be identified with certainty. However, small adults of 36-42 mm body length were caught in abundance later in the summer (February to March), after larval recruitment in and near Gerlache Strait had ceased. Many of these small adults then appeared to be post-reproductive. In Bransfield Strait during late summer (late February to March) there was a nearly equal mixture of small adults (which dominated in Gerlache Strait) and large adults (> 42 mm); the large adults showed most evidence of recent reproductive activity and could have been responsible for much of the late summer larval recruitment in Bransfield Strait. In Drake Passage, large adults were usually dominant; the few caught in December were undergoing maturation near the South Shetlands, and in January they were reproductive and dispersed in more offshore oceanic waters. During late February to March, krill became more available in Drake Passage with many having reassembled in aggregations near Livingston Island (South Shetlands). By then, not only small adults but also large adults appeared post-reproductive in all areas. Evidence relating to growth rate in adults was obscured by erratic variations in ratios of body-length classes, month-to-month, considered artifacts on sampling. However, adult growth appeared negligible during January to March. After midsummer (January) there were distinct changes in relative abundances of males to females of > 42 mm: within 43-47 mm the modal frequencies favored females, and within 48-55 mm males were dominant, suggesting differential survivorship. The Gerlache-Bransfield Straits and similar coastal habitats must be considered nursery areas, not only for immature krill as has been previously proposed, but also for early summer larvae. In particularly productive years, as in 1986-87, these coastal waters may become spawning localities for small adult krill before reproduction by large adults develops farther away from the Peninsula. Immatures of < 12 mm in December and ca 16-30 mm by March, comprised a subgroup of the smallest immature krill though not consistently abundant enough to be distinguished as a year class. Their distributions suggest origins and early growth outside of the study area, possibly in the Weddell Sea and coastal waters of the Bellingshausen Sea.																	0198-0149					AUG-SEP	1991	38	8-9					1169	1193		10.1016/0198-0149(91)90101-K							WOS:A1991GH34600013

Besides adult features, such ontogenetic characters enabled us to propose a hypothesis of the phylogenetic relationships of and within the Euphausiacea on the basis of a computer aided cladistic analysis. These are of the form (Bentheuphausia amblyops + Euphausiidae = (' Thysanopoda' + Nematobrachion + Euphausiinae = (Meganyctiphanes norvegica + Euphausiini, new name + Nematoscelini, new name = ( Nyctiphanes + Nematoscelina, new name)))). From this analysis the taxon names 'Euphausiina', 'Nematoscelini', and 'Nematoscelina' are introduced for in-groups of the taxon Euphausiacea as representing monophyletic units. The position of a set of ontogenetic characters remains relatively uncertain due to the still unknown larval development of Bentheuphausia amblyops (G. O. Sars, 1883).																	0018-8158					APR	2001	448	1-3					143	169		10.1023/A:1017549321961							WOS:000169863400014						
J	Henschke, N; Pakhornov, EA				Henschke, Natasha; Pakhornov, Evgeny A.			Latitudinal variations in Salpa thompsoni reproductive fitness	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Salpa thompsoni is a major grazer that plays a significant and disproportionate role in the Southern Ocean biogeochemical cycle. It occurs in higher numbers in the warmer mid-latitude waters of the Southern Ocean. In recent decades, salp populations shifted significantly southward intruding into areas generally dominated by Antarctic krill. It is unclear whether salps can survive in high latitude waters because of their hypothesized negative reproductive response to low temperatures and scarcity of food. To explore how environmental conditions impact S. thompsoni reproductive fitness, we examined a long-term (1993-2013), cross-latitudinal dataset of S. thompsoni population demographics in the Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean. Observations cover over 25 degrees of latitude, from just south of the Subtropical Convergence to the Antarctic continent. S. thompsoni populations were strongly driven by temperature with higher abundances observed at temperatures between 3 degrees C and 5 degrees C. Occasionally, dense and mature populations of S. thompsoni occurred at high latitudes during summer, declining in density by autumn, which was accompanied by significant increases in the appearance of failed embryos. The proportion of failed embryos was significantly correlated with decreasing temperature and Chl a, indicating the importance of these parameters in autumn and high latitude population collapses. The successful development and release of an embryo is a critical factor determining the persistence of S. thompsoni populations. Blastozooid bud release occurred continuously from spring to autumn, and may be a way S. thompsoni populations mitigate against the sensitivity of the blastozooid's reproductive fitness to high-Antarctic conditions.																	0024-3590	1939-5590				MAR	2019	64	2					575	584		10.1002/lno.11061							WOS:000461865500011

However, the n-3 PUFA-PLs are usually a mixture of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) enriched phospholipids. Hence, the effects of EPA-PLs alone on cognitive deficiency are still unclear. In the present study, we obtained almost pure EPA-PLs (EPA:DHA = 47.9:2.08) from the sea cucumber, Cucumaria frondosa, and investigated its effects on A beta-induced cognitive impairment in rats. Administration of EPA-PLs (150 and 300 mg/kg.day, i.g., 27 days) did not increase brain DHA but significantly improved A beta-induced cognitive deficiency. Further mechanism research indicated that EPA-PLs alleviated A beta-induced neurotoxicity including oxidative stress, apoptosis, neuro-infiammation cascade, and hyper-phosphorylated tau in a dose-dependent pattern. These findings first suggest that EPA-PLs could also improve A beta induced cognitive deficiency in a similar mechanism with DHA-PLs. (c) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Ecological zonation	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART I-OCEANOGRAPHIC RESEARCH PAPERS												The composition, distribution, abundance, biomass and size structure of mesozooplankton, collected using Bongo nets in the top 300 m layer along a transect between the Antarctic continent and Cape Town, were investigated during the second South African Antarctic Marine Ecosystem Study (SAAMES II) in Jan.-Feb. 1993. Small (<10 mm) and medium (20-50 mm) size groups of zooplankton consistently dominated across the Southern Ocean. The highest zooplankton densities were recorded at the Antarctic Polar Front (APF) and at the Subtropical Convergence (STC). Minor peaks in zooplankton densities were observed in the southern vicinity of the Subantarctic Front (SAF) and APF. Elevated zooplankton stocks were also found within the Marginal Ice Zone (MIZ) and the Polar Frontal Zone. The lowest densities were recorded in the permanently open zone (MIZ-APF) and in the Subantarctic zone (SAF-STC). Copepods were generally important along the entire transect and formed the bulk of zooplankton stock within the MIZ and in the Polar Frontal Zone (APF-SAF), accounting for at least 40-95% of total abundance and biomass. Euphausiids were also a prominent group along the transect. Their contribution was highest (up to 80% of total biomass) between the MIZ and the APF, mainly because of the occurrence of swarms of the Antarctic krill Euphausia superba. Tunicates, Pyrosoma sp. and Salpa fusiformis, were found in great numbers only in the region of the STC and further north, while Salpa thompsoni was abundant at the southern boundary of the APF. Chaetognaths dominated samples numerically and by mass in the Subantarctic Zone. Results obtained from cluster and ordination analyses show that zooplankton community structure was well correlated with the position of various biogeographical zones separated by the main frontal systems of the Southern Ocean. Two major groupings of stations, separated by the SAF, were identified in these analyses. This front separated the Antarctic and the subantarctic/subtropical assemblages, confirming its important role as a biogeographical boundary. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

E. crystallorophias was limited to inshore waters. Detailed stratified sampling revealed that E. superba formed dense aggregations well below the ice, but was not inhabiting the ice itself. In general, E. superba occupied the depth stratum from 15 to 130 m; few or no other zooplankton were found within E. superba swarms. T. macrura displayed a depth preference for the strata from 90 to 250 m. Size-frequency distributions for E. superba and for T macrura showed that larvae were absent and that both populations were dominated by small adults. A life cycle for T macrura is proposed.																	0171-8630					JUN	1994	109	2-3					131	142		10.3354/meps109131							WOS:A1994NX76600003

New Determination of Prey and Parasite Species for Northern Indian Ocean Blue Whales	FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE												Blue whales are little studied, face significant anthropogenic threats and within the Northern Indian Ocean, have a restricted range, making them an archetype for conservation needs of megafauna around the world. We studied feeding behavior of blue whales using dietary DNA metabarcoding of fecal samples. While globally blue whale populations feed predominantly on Euphausiidae, 87% of prey DNA amplicons extracted from fecal samples from this population were sergestid shrimp, demonstrating that blue whales can locate and feed on dense swarms of other types of prey when they occur. Within the Indian Ocean sergestids are present within the top 300 m, which correlates with the deep scattering layer observed by hydroacoustics. Studies suggest that this requirement to dive deeper in search of prey likely explains the prevalence of fluke up diving within this population of blue whales relative to other parts of the globe. Furthermore, this study revealed the presence of acanthocephalan endoparasites within the stomach and intestines of the Northern Indian Ocean blue whales. This represents the first record of Acanthocephala in blue whales in the Northern Indian Ocean and highlights the need for further studies on both the ecto- and endoparasitic flora and monitoring of health of these cetaceans for their management and conservation.

We examined potential factors affecting this seasonal pattern of distribution by counting short-tailed shearwaters from boats. Their main prey, krill, was sampled by net tows in the southeastern Bering Sea/Aleutian Islands and in the Bering Strait/southern Chukchi Sea. Short-tailed shearwaters were mainly distributed in the southeastern Bering Sea/Aleutian Islands (60 +/- 473 birds km(-2)) in July 2013, and in the Bering Strait/southern Chukchi Sea (19 +/- 91 birds km(-2)) in September 2012. In the Bering Strait/southern Chukchi Sea, krill size was greater in September 2012 (9.6 +/- 5.0 mm in total length) than in July 2013 (1.9 +/- 1.2 mm). Within the Bering Strait/southern Chukchi Sea in September 2012, short-tailed shearwaters occurred more frequently in cells (50 +/- 50 km) where large-sized krill were more abundant. These findings, and information previously collected in other studies, suggest that the seasonal northward movement of short-tailed shearwaters might be associated with the seasonal increase in krill size in the Bering Strait/southern Chukchi Sea. We could not, however, rule out the possibility that large interannual variation in krill abundance might influence the seasonal distribution of shearwaters. This study highlights the importance of krill, which is advected from the Pacific, as an important prey of top predators in the Arctic marine ecosystem.

The habitat utilization of top predators has been studied using electronic tags to follow their movements and foraging behavior. In addition, these tags provide information on the physical characteristics of the water column (temperature and salinity) at a scale and resolution that is coincident with the animals' behavior. In addition to data on the animals' behavior, these tags provide physical oceanographic data in regions or at times they cannot be collected using other currently available technologies.

J	Eastman, JT; Sidell, BD				Eastman, JT; Sidell, BD			Measurements of buoyancy for some Antarctic notothenioid fishes from the South Shetland Islands	POLAR BIOLOGY												Buoyancy was measured for 258 specimens representing 13 species of adult and sub-adult nototheniids, bathydraconids, and channichthyids from the South Shetland Islands. Measurements were expressed as percentage buoyancy (%B) = W-water/W(air)x10(2). There were no neutrally buoyant species and mean values for %B were 3.07-6.11%, with channichthyids at the low end and benthic nototheniids and bathydraconids at the high end. All species showed an ontogenetic decrease in %B with increasing body weight. With the exception of Champsocephalus gunnari, there was no sexual dimorphism in %B within this sample. With some exceptions, values for %B were consistent with life-history information. Sub-adult Dissostichus mawsoni were not neutrally buoyant, as are large adults. Notothenia rossii had a significantly lower %B than closely related N. coriiceps. Benthic Gobionotothen gibber frons had a lower %B than semipelagic Lepidonotothen larseni. Although they exhibit some diversification in life history, the four channichthyids in the sample were similar in %B. Neutral buoyancy is rare in notothenioids and may be confined to a single nototheniid clade.

Distribution, population dynamics and growth rates of Thysanopoda acutifrons, Thysanoessa inermis and Nematobrachion boopis in the Irminger Sea, North Atlantic	JOURNAL OF THE MARINE BIOLOGICAL ASSOCIATION OF THE UNITED KINGDOM												Euphausiids are an important component of the northern North Atlantic ecosystem and several species are found in the Irminger Sea. However, data on euphausiids in this region are few, particularly for Thysanopoda acutifrons, Thysanoessa inermis and Nematobranchion boopis. In this paper, we present the first data since the 1930s on the seasonal distribution and population dynamics of these species from net haul data collected in the Irminger Sea during winter, spring and summer 2001-2002. Thysanoessa inermis was the most numerically abundant (0.63-26.62 ind. 1000 m(-3)) of the three species in the region and comprised a biomass of 3.92-41.74 mg 1000 m(-3). The species was largely found in the upper regions of the water column (0-400 m) and was distributed in the more on-shelf/shelf-break regions around East Greenland and Iceland. Growth rates were around 0.03 mm d(-1) for T. inermis and there was some evidence that either the timing of spawning was delayed, or larval development was prolonged in the region. Thysanopoda acutifrons was predominantly distributed below 400 m in more oceanic regions and had a low abundance (1.23-1.64 ind. 1000 m(-3)) throughout the Irminger Sea. However, the species comprised a relatively high proportion of biomass (19.39-31.33 mg 1000 m(-3)) due to its large body size. Our data showed that the species had low rates of growth (0.04 mm d(-1)) and development throughout the year, and that the reproductive season occurred during the overwintering period (November/December) once individuals had reached two years of age. Nematobranchion boopis mainly occurred below 400 m at low abundance (0.06-0.18 ind. 1000 m(-3)) levels throughout the region. The species was largely found where Atlantic waters prevailed in the Irminger Current and its growth rates were variable (0.02-0.06 mm d(-1)). Nematobranchion boopis was a year-round spawner and the species had fairly rapid rates of post-larval development, with the newly spawned 0-group reaching sexual maturity within the first 6 months. Data presented in this paper provide useful baselines for understanding the possible impacts of long-term, broad-scale environmental change on the ecology of euphausiid communities in the Irminger Sea.

In this context, we tested the "Intersexual Competition Hypothesis" for penguins by investigating the feeding ecology of Gentoo penguins during their austral winter non-breeding season. We considered this during unusual environmental conditions (i.e. the year 2009 had observations of high sea surface and air temperatures) in comparison with the long term average at Bird Island, South Georgia. Through conventional (i.e. stomach contents) and stable isotopic values from red blood cells, plasma and feathers of both male and female Gentoo penguins, we showed that there were significant differences between sexes, with males feeding mainly on fish (54% by mass) followed by crustaceans (38%) whereas females fed mainly on crustaceans (89% by mass) followed by fish (4%). Themisto gaudichaudii was the most important crustacean prey for males (64% by mass; 82% by number; 53% by frequency of occurrence) and females (63% by mass; 77% by number; 89% by frequency of occurrence), contrasting with all previous studies that found Antarctic krill Euphausia superba were generally the main prey. Stable isotopic data showed that, in terms of habitat use (based on delta C-13), there were significant differences in short-term carbon signatures between males and females (based on plasma and red blood cells), suggesting that both sexes explored different habitats, with females exploring more offshore pelagic waters and males feeding more in coastal benthic waters. Based on delta N-15, males fed on significantly higher trophic level than females (based on plasma and red blood cells), in agreement with our diet results., Thus, Gentoo penguins behave in a similar manner to other non-breeding penguins species (e.g. king, macaroni and rockhopper penguins), albeit at a smaller spatial scale (as they do not disperse as these other penguins do), in that they have a wider habitat and trophic niche during the Antarctic Winter (in comparison to Summer). We also detected individual specialization in feeding/trophic levels for each gender, with certain males feeding mainly on fish and certain females mainly on crustaceans, which may be driven the prevailing environmental conditions that lead individuals to search for alternative prey, and cause sexual diet segregation. Our results provide further information to help improve understanding about sexual segregation and individual specialization of marine organisms, while contributing valuable information on the winter diet for Antarctic monitoring programs and for modelling Antarctic marine food webs.

Repeat sampling was conducted in the Gulf of Maine with a 1 m(2) MOCNESS equipped with a light-emitting diode (LED)-based strobe light concurrent to multifrequency acoustic data collection. On cruise one, the strobe light's efficacy in reducing euphausiid net avoidance was evaluated on two horizontal tows where four of the eight nets were sampled with the strobe flashing and four with the strobe off. With the strobe light on, there was a significant increase in euphausiid abundance by a factor of 4.5 at night and by a factor of 11.0 during the day. There was also a significant increase in biovolume catch of zooplankton when the strobe light was on by factors of 2.2 at night and 5.5 during the day due to a higher abundance of 10 and 35 mm euphausiids. Euphausiids caught with the strobe light on accounted for most of the observed backscattering, and acoustic and net estimates of their abundance agreed. Similar results were obtained on cruise two. Agreement of acoustic and net estimates when using the strobe light suggests that reduced avoidance enhanced the efficiency of catching euphausiids.

The biomass of the benthos in grabs at the depth of 6160 m is 117.06 g/m(2); 80.9% of this are ophiuroids. The main component of ophiuroid food is detritus which is marked by the smallest particles of the euphausiacean chitin. Its source is the ''rain of dead bodies'' of planktonic crustaceans sinking from rich swarms of antarctic krill inhabiting the upper layers. The geographical position of the Orkney Trench in the center of the highly productive pelagic zone of the Southern Ocean calls for the rich and peculiar trophic structure of the bottom fauna up to the maximal depth of the Ocean. The mechanism, which ensures this phenomenon, is the trophical connections between the animals of the benthic and pelagic zones.

Using geolocation to track the winter dispersion of the macaroni penguin	BIOLOGY LETTERS												Although penguins are key marine predators from the Southern Ocean, their migratory behaviour during the inter-nesting period remains widely unknown. Here, we report for the first time, to our knowledge, the winter foraging movements and feeding habits of a penguin species by using geolocation sensors fitted on penguins with a new attachment method. We focused on the macaroni penguin Eudyptes chrysolophus at Kerguelen, the single largest consumer of marine prey among all seabirds. Overall, macaroni penguins performed very long winter trips, remaining at sea during approximately six months within the limits of the Southern Ocean. They departed from Kerguelen in an eastward direction and distributed widely, over more than 3.10(6) km(2). The penguins spent most of their time in a previously unrecognized foraging area, i.e. a narrow latitudinal band (47-49 degrees S) within the central Indian Ocean (70-110 degrees E), corresponding oceanographically to the Polar Frontal Zone. There, their blood isotopic niche indicated that macaroni penguins preyed mainly upon crustaceans, but not on Antarctic krill Euphausia superba, which does not occur at these northern latitudes. Such winter information is a crucial step for a better integrative approach for the conservation of this species whose world population is known to be declining.

J	Hewitt, R				Hewitt, R			An index of per capita recruitment	CCAMLR SCIENCE												An index of per capita recruitment (PCR) is proposed such that PCRy-1 = R1(y)/(1-R1(y))e(M) where R1 is the proportion of age-1 animals sampled in year y and M is the post-recruit mortality rate. The intent of the index is to facilitate investigation of reproductive success and the factors postulated to affect it. The formulation of PCX is based on the assumptions that: (i) post-recruit mortality does not vary over age or between years; (ii) 100% of age-1 animals spawn; (iii) a representative sample of the population is available; and (iv) the proportion of age-1 animals in the sample can be determined unambiguously. Normal, lognormal and uniform probability distributions of R1, and three levels of M were assumed in order to investigate the resulting distributions of PCX. Distributions of PCX are skewed toward higher values such that the dynamic range of PCR is largest with high values of R1; increasing M tends to offset this effect but only slightly: A simple population model was then constructed to test the sensitivity of PCR to relaxation of its underlying assumptions. PCX is not biased relative to recruits per spawner when mortality is constant over all ages and years, and when all age-1 animals spawn. These conclusions are insensitive to changes in the shape of the functional relationship between spawners and recruits. PCR is biased low with age-specific decline in mortality and reduction in the proportion of age-1 spawners. Introducing year-to-year random variability in both mortality and proportion of age-1 spawners resulted in broader distributions of PCX relative to recruits per spawner but did not appear to introduce additional bias. On average, PCR will underestimate recruits per spawner by 30% if reasonable assumptions are made regarding the variability of mortality and the proportion of age-1 spawners. The effectiveness of PCX to track changes in recruits per spawner over time was confirmed by introducing cycles in the shape of the functional relationship between spawners and recruits. PCX was also able to track cycles in recruits per spawner after a 20% random sampling error was added to the value of R1 used in the calculation of PCX and year-to-year random variability in mortality and proportion of age-1 spawners was introduced, although errors were larger. A time series of PCX for Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) sampled in the vicinity of the South Shetland Islands from 1979 to 1998 is presented.																	1023-4063						2000	7						179	196									WOS:000166295500011

The seasonal cycle of the Lazarev Sea macrozooplankton community and a potential shift to top-down trophic control in winter	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY												Between 2004 and 2008, during the German Southern Ocean GLOBEC programme, four large scale bio-oceanographic surveys were conducted in the Lazarev Sea for the Lazarev Sea Krill Survey (LAKRIS). These surveys were completed in Autumn (April-May) 2004, Summer (December-January) 2005/06, Winter (July-August) 2006, and Summer (December-January) 2007/08. On each occasion macrozooplankton communities were sampled by RMT-8 in the upper 200 m of the water column. Chlorophyll a biomass averaged similar to 1.5 mg m(-3) (max=8.2 mg m(-3)) in Summer 05/06, 0.88 mg m(-3) (max=2.77 mg m(-3)) in Summer 07/08, 0.24 mg m(-3) (max=0.73 mg m(-3)) in Autumn 04, and 0.042 mg m(-3) (max= 0.1 mg m(-3)) in Winter 06. Macrozooplankton densities did not differ significantly between seasons and were 53, 68, 59, and 48 ind. 1000 m(-3) in Summer 05/06, Summer 07/08, Autumn, and Winter, respectively. Total macrozooplankton biomass, however, increased significantly from summer (0.88 and 0.97 g dry weight 1000 m(-3) in Summer 05/06 and Summer 07/08, respectively) to Autumn 04 (2.66 g dry weight 1000 m(-3)) and Winter 06 levels (1.75 g dry weight 1000 m(-3)). This biomass increase was due to both an increased occurrence of Euphausia superba and fish and a shift to a larger size structure in the latter group. Siphonophores (predominantly Diphyes antarctica), chaetognaths (predominantly Eukrohnia hamata and Sagitta gazellae) and euphausiids (predominantly Thysanoessa macrura and E. superba) contributed >80% to total densities in all four surveys. However, a strong and distinctive change in assemblage structure was observed between seasons. Key amongst these was a shift within the euphausiids from a dominance of T. macrura in summer to that of E. superba in autumn and winter; a winter decrease in E. hamata; an autumn and winter decrease in Tomopteris sp.; and a winter increase in the abundance of the grazers Clio pyramidata sulcata and Ihlea racovitzai, hyperiids, and the myctophid fish Electrona antarctica. Carnivorous macrozooplankton formed the major trophic group in all seasons, contributing 44-60% to total macrozooplankton abundance and 39-58% to total macrozooplankton biomass in all four surveys. The combined predation pressure of carnivores and potential increased winter carnivory by E. superba and other omnivorous species, was expected to be high. In view of low winter primary production, we suggest that the epipelagic food web of the Lazarev Sea shifted from being bottom-up controlled in summer to top-down controlled in winter.

Counting whales in a challenging, changing environment	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS												Estimating abundance of Antarctic minke whales is central to the International Whaling Commission's conservation and management work and understanding impacts of climate change on polar marine ecosystems. Detecting abundance trends is problematic, in part because minke whales are frequently sighted within Antarctic sea ice where navigational safety concerns prevent ships from surveying. Using icebreaker-supported helicopters, we conducted aerial surveys across a gradient of ice conditions to estimate minke whale density in the Weddell Sea. The surveys revealed substantial numbers of whales inside the sea ice. The Antarctic summer sea ice is undergoing rapid regional change in annual extent, distribution, and length of ice-covered season. These trends, along with substantial interannual variability in ice conditions, affect the proportion of whales available to be counted by traditional shipboard surveys. The strong association between whales and the dynamic, changing sea ice requires reexamination of the power to detect trends in whale abundance or predict ecosystem responses to climate change.

Data can directly be compared, since the same transect counts were applied by the same team from the same icebreaking ship in both regions. The main conclusion is that densities of seabirds and marine mammals are similar in open water and at the ice edge from both polar regions, while the presence of Adelie penguins, minke whales and crabeater seals in densities more than one order of magnitude higher in Antarctic pack-ice must reflect a major ecological difference between both polar systems. The ecological implications of these observations are discussed, especially concerning important primary and secondary (krill) productions under the Weddell Sea pack-ice.

J	Froneman, PW; Pakhomov, EA; Laubscher, RK				Froneman, PW; Pakhomov, EA; Laubscher, RK			Microphytoplankton assemblages in the waters surrounding South Georgia, Antarctica during austral summer 1994	POLAR BIOLOGY												The composition and distribution of microphytoplankton assemblages in the vicinity of South Georgia were examined during a krill survey conducted during voyage 119 the RV Africana in austral summer (January/February) 1994. Microphytoplankton distribution was studied at 83 stations along a zig-zag transect in the waters surrounding South Georgia. Oceanographic and zooplankton data suggest that conditions were anomalous during the investigation, in that sub-Antarctic surface waters had probably been advected southwards and were present around the island. The two most widely distributed species were Corethron criophilum and Eucampia antarctica, which were recorded at all stations sampled. Also well-represented amongst the microphytoplankton assemblages were temperate, neritic species such as Chaetoceros atlanticus, Proboscia alata and Odontella weissflogii. This can probably be related to the intrusion of sub-Antarctic surface waters unusually far south. Cluster and ordination analysis identified three distinct groupings of stations in the waters surrounding the islands. These were found to the east, west and north of the islands. The diatom groupings identified during this investigation broadly correspond to three water masses previously described in the vicinity of South Georgia. Despite the anomalous hydrographical conditions that existed during the investigation, the differences in phytoplankton were negligible when compared to normal years. Small mesoscale features are, however, important in imposing biogeographic patterns on microphytoplankton.

Distribution, abundance and ecological requirements of the benthic phase of Munida gregaria (Anomura; Munididae) in the Puyuhuapi Fjord (Chilean Patagonia)	REGIONAL STUDIES IN MARINE SCIENCE												The squat lobster Munida gregaria is considered a key species within food webs of sub-Antarctic ecosystems of South America, and represents a fundamental link between detritus and higher-level predators. Although ecological aspects of its lengthy pelagic phase have been well described, those of the benthic stage remain poorly understood, particularly in Chilean Patagonia where information on the presence of benthic phases of M. gregaria has been scarce. The present paper aims to improve our knowledge of this important species, analysing benthic distribution, abundance and ecological requirements of the benthic phase of M. gregaria in the Puyuhuapi and Jacaf fjords in the Aysen Region of Chilean Patagonia. An extensive SCUBA diving survey, carried out between 2014 and 2019, allowed us to explore and document the soft seafloors inside these fjords. These benthic surveys conducted photographic transects between depths of 5 and 20 m to enumerate populations of M. gregaria and to measure sizes of individuals. The study revealed the presence of large aggregations of M. gregaria, with densities up to 4 times higher than previously reported maxima for South America. Munida gregaria appeared to be unable to live at the shallow depths of the brackish surface layer typical of fjords, though paradoxically, its presence on the seabed was linked to river outflow, and probably related to supply of organic matter. Chilean fjords are currently facing a number of challenges, particularly from climate change and other more direct anthropogenic impacts, and the key role of M. gregaria in these fjords should be considered in future monitoring activities. More particularly, the extremely high abundance of M. gregaria in Puyuhuapi Fjord should be considered in any rigorous protection measures planned for the fjord. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

J	Yang, G; Li, CL; Sun, S				Yang, Guang; Li, Chaolun; Sun, Song			Inter-annual variation in summer zooplankton community structure in Prydz Bay, Antarctica, from 1999 to 2006	POLAR BIOLOGY												Inter-annual variations in zooplankton community structure in Prydz Bay were investigated using multivariate analysis based on samples collected with a 330-mu m mesh, 0.5-m(2) Norpac net during the austral summer from 1999 to 2006. Two distinct communities, an oceanic and a neritic community, were consistently identified in all surveys. Oceanic communities had higher diversity and were indicated by species such as Haloptilus ocellatus, Heterorhabdus austrinus, Thysanoessa macrura, Rhincalanus gigas, Scolecithricella minor and Oikopleura sp.. Neritic communities were indicated by Euphausia crystallorophias and Stephos longipes and were characterized by fewer but more abundant species. In 1999 and 2006, a transitional community was also distinguished near the continental shelf edge, where ice coverage was more extensive than either the oceanic or neritic regions. Significant inter-annual variations in community structure (mainly involving species abundance rather than species composition) were found in both oceanic and neritic communities, being more obvious in the latter. The timing and amplitude of sea ice retreat (polynya appearance), and its effect on food availability, had strong influences on zooplankton community structure. In oceanic communities during years with earlier ice retreat, the extra time available for phytoplankton blooms to accumulate resulted in a higher proportion of large copepods (Calanoides acutus, Calanus propinquus, Metridia gerlachei) (especially the younger copepodites) in the zooplankton assemblage. In neritic communities, zooplankton such as the ice krill E. crystallorophias, and large copepods (C. acutus, C. propinquus, M. gerlachei), also showed higher abundance and earlier developmental stages in years with larger polynya. On the other hand, in years with later ice retreat, smaller polynya, and less time for phytoplankton blooms to form, the abundance of large copepods was lower and older age classes were more common.																	0722-4060	1432-2056				JUN	2011	34	6					921	932		10.1007/s00300-010-0948-z							WOS:000290331300013

O. Sars" with port-orientated beams. Each ping samples a volume of 60 degrees horizontally x 45 degrees vertically with 500 beams, which is often enough to insonify a complete school of fish or zooplankton. The large amount of resulting data is efficiently preprocessed with automatic, real-time detections of school candidates; these are accepted or rejected during post-processing. The system was used on the continental shelf near the Subantarctic island of South Georgia to study Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba), and some of the detected schools were immediately sampled with a six-frequency echosounder (Simrad EK60), then trawled with various nets to verify the target species and their size composition. For schools acoustically categorized as euphausiids, data from the two acoustic systems were used to estimate the school morphometrics and the krill size distributions. The principal objectives of this study were to explore the potential of combining data from a multibeam sonar, multifrequency echosounders, and nets, and to describe the efficient processing methods and software that facilitate the multi-instrument analyses. Three-dimensional morphometrics based on the MS70 data were consistent with corresponding two-dimensional morphometrics based on the echosounder data and could be used to improve the acoustic classifications of taxa or species. Additionally, automatic preprocessing and integration of data from different sources into the same user interface allowed efficient exploration and interpretation of all the acoustic data.

Predicting Which Species Succeed in Climate-Forced Polar Seas	FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE												Understanding the mechanisms which determine the capacity of any species to adapt to changing environmental conditions is one of the foremost requirements in accurately predicting which populations, species and clades are likely to survive ongoing, rapid climate change. The polar oceans are amongst the most rapidly changing environments on Earth with reduced regional sea ice duration and extent, and their fauna's expected sensitivity to warming and acidification. These changes potentially pose a significant threat to a number of polar fauna. There is, therefore, a critical need to assess the vulnerability of a wide range of species to determine the tipping points or weak links in marine assemblages. Knowledge of the effect of multiple stressors on polar marine fauna has advanced over the last 40 years, but there are still many data gaps. This study applies ecological risk assessment techniques to the increasing knowledge of polar species' physiological capacities to identify their exposure to climate change and their vulnerability to this exposure. This relatively rapid, semi-quantitative assessment provides a layer of vulnerability on top of climate envelope models, until such times as more extensive physiological data sets can be produced. The risk assessment identified more species that are likely to benefit from the near-future predicted change (the winners), especially predators and deposit feeders. Fewer species were scored at risk (the losers), although animals that feed on krill scored consistently as under the highest risk.

J	La Mesa, M; Eastman, JT; Vacchi, M				La Mesa, M; Eastman, JT; Vacchi, M			The role of notothenioid fish in the food web of the Ross Sea shelf waters: a review	POLAR BIOLOGY												The Ross Sea, a large, high-latitude (72-78degreesS) embayment of the Antarctic continental shelf, averages 500 m deep, with troughs to 1,200 m and the shelf break at 700 m. It is covered by pack ice for 9 months of the year. The fish fauna of about 80 species includes primarily 4 families and 53 species of the endemic perciform suborder Notothenioidei. This review focuses on the diet and role in the food web of notothenioids and top-level bird and mammal predators, and also includes new information on the diets of artedidraconids and bathydraconids. Although principally a benthic group, notothenioids have diversified to form an adaptive radiation that includes pelagic and semipelagic species. In the southern Ross Sea, notothenioids dominate the fish fauna at levels of abundance and biomass >90% and are, therefore, inordinately important in the food web. Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) and mesopelagic fishes are virtually absent from the shelf waters of the Ross Sea. Of the four notothenioid families, nototheniids show the most ecological and dietary diversification, with pelagic, cryopelagic, epibenthic and benthic species. Neutrally buoyant Pleuragramma antarcticum constitutes >90% of both the abundance and biomass of the midwater fish fauna. Most benthic nototheniids are opportunistic and feed on seasonally or locally abundant zooplanktonic prey. Artedidraconids are benthic sit-and-wait predators. Larger bathydraconids are benthic predators on fish while smaller species feed mainly on benthic crustaceans. Channichthyids are less dependent on the bottom for food than other notothenioids. Some species combine benthic and pelagic life styles; others are predominantly pelagic and all consume euphausiids and/or fish. South polar skuas, Antarctic petrels, Adelie and emperor penguins, Weddell seals and minke and killer whales are the higher vertebrate components of the food web, and all prey on notothenioids to some extent. Based on the frequency of occurrence of prey items in the stomachs of fish, bird and mammal predators, P. antarcticum and ice krill E. crystallorophias are the key species in the food web of the Ross Sea. P. antarcticum is a component of the diet of at least 11 species of nototheniid, bathydraconid and channichthyid fish and, at frequencies of occurrence from 71 to 100%, is especially important for Dissostichus mawsoni, Gvozdarus svetovidovi and some channichthyids. At least 16 species of notothenioids serve as prey for bird and mammal predators, but P. antarcticum is the most important and is a major component of the diet of south polar skua, Adelie and emperor penguins and Weddell seals, at frequencies of occurrence from 26 to 100%. E. crystallorophias is consumed by some nototheniid and channichthyid fish and can be of importance in the diet of emperor and Adelie penguins, although in the latter case, this is dependent on location and time of year. Unlike the linear phytoplankton-->E. superba-->consumers of the E. superba food chain hypothesized for much of the Southern Ocean, the food web of the Ross Sea shelf is non-linear, with complex prey-predator interactions. Notothenioid fish play a key role: as predators, they occupy most of the trophic niches available in the ecosystem, relying on benthic, zooplanktonic and nektonic organisms; as prey, they are important food resources for each other and for most top predators living and foraging on the shelf. They also constitute the major link between lower (invertebrates) and higher (birds and mammals) levels of the food web. This is especially true for P. antarcticum. Along with E. crystallorophias, its ecological role in the Ross Sea is equivalent to that of myctophids and E. superba elsewhere in the Southern Ocean.

Embryo biometry of three broadcast spawning euphausiid species applied to identify cross-shelf and seasonal spawning patterns along the Oregon coast	JOURNAL OF PLANKTON RESEARCH												Morphology and biometry of eggs spawned by females of Euphausia pacifica, Thysanoessa spinifera and Thysanoessa inspinata were compared with eggs collected along the Oregon coast to identify the eggs in preserved samples to species level and to infer species spawning areas and intensity of spawning events in the field. The average chorion diameter (CD) and embryo diameter (ED) were significantly larger for E. pacifica than for T. spinifera. Euphausia pacifica eggs usually have a significantly greater perivitelline space, and the chorion is firm, transparent, smooth, elastic and completely spherical, while T. spinifera embryos are not completely spherical and typically are soft and sticky with particles attached. Eggs of the twitching stage embryo of T. spinifera have an elliptical shape, while those of E. pacifica are spherical to very slightly elliptical even after hatching as nauplii. The CD and ED of T. inspinata eggs were smaller than those of the other two species and they were transparent and spherical with a non-sticky chorion. Biweekly time series of eggs (identified to species), of nauplii + metanauplii and of ripe females collected along the Newport hydrographic line (44 degrees 40'N) during 1970-1972 show that E. pacifica and T. spinifera spawn mainly < 40 km from the coast from March to October, but E. pacifica also spawns regularly at oceanic locations. A meta-analysis of the egg CD and ED values of 38 euphausiid species around the world indicates that these variables alone cannot be used to identify eggs to species, excepting specific regions where one or two broadcast spawners dominate the euphausiid assemblage.																	0142-7873	1464-3774				JUN	2010	32	6					739	760		10.1093/plankt/fbq028							WOS:000277448800001

We compared the food chain dynamics of these radionuclides in plankton assemblages by measuring the uptake and trophic transfer of Po-210 and Pb-210 from phytoplankton to brine shrimp Artemia sp. to euphausiids Meganyctiphanes norvegica under controlled laboratory conditions. The ratio of Po-210:Pb-210 within organisms increased 5- to 12-fold with each trophic level (phytoplankton to grazer to carnivore), reflecting a preferential bioaccumulation of Po-210 over Pb-210. M norvegica assimilated 44 % of the polonium ingested but only 3.5% of the Pb-210 ingested. Because Pb-210 was unassimilated, the ratio of Po-210:Pb-210 was 1 to 2 orders of magnitude smaller in zooplankton fecal pellets than in the animals producing them. These results suggest that in surface waters Po-210 has the potential to build up in food chains and be biologically recycled, whereas Pb-210 would not build up in marine food chains and would display shorter residence times. Since euphausiids comprise an important link between small plankton and larger predatory animals in many marine ecosystems, they may serve as an important conduit of Po-210 to those predators consumed as seafood by humans.

J	De Robertis, A; Schell, C; Jaffe, JS				De Robertis, A; Schell, C; Jaffe, JS			Acoustic observations of the swimming behavior of the euphausiid Euphausia pacifica Hansen	ICES JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE												A high-resolution, 445 kHz, multi-beam sonar and new data-processing techniques were used to characterize the swimming behavior of the euphausiid Euphausia pacifica Hansen, in Saanich Inlet, British Columbia. The instrument was deployed when the euphausiids were at depth during the day and during dusk periods of population ascent. Three-dimensional swimming paths of individual euphausiids were reconstructed by linking successive, acoustically-determined positions. Median swimming speeds were 1.8 cm s(-1) during the day and 2.2-3.5 cm s(-1) during dusk periods of vertical ascent. The presence of a fish at distances of 20-300 cm did not affect the swimming speed or turning of the euphausiids, suggesting that they did not respond to the presence of a potential predator at these distances. Euphausiids moved primarily obliquely in the vertical plane, with few individuals moving directly up or down, even during periods of vertical migration at dusk. We hypothesize that oblique swimming trajectories of euphausiids may reduce vulnerability to visual predators by allowing them to maintain bioluminescent counter-illumination during vertical migration.

Application of this model at latitudes where sea ice retreat occurs and in adjacent open sea and permanently ice-covered areas demonstrated that the marginal ice zone is a region of enhanced primary and bacterioplankton production. Combining the results of the phyto- and bacterioplankton models allowed the quantitative estimate of the carbon fluxes through the lower level of the planktonic food web of the Weddell Sea marginal ice zone during the sea ice retreat period. The resulting carbon budget revealed the quantitative importance of microbial and micrograzing processes in the pathways of net primary production, 71% of this latter being assimilated in the microbial food web. However, total net microbial food web secondary production contributed 28% of 'marginal ice zone produced' food resources available to krill and other zooplankton.																	0304-4203					NOV	1991	35	1-4					305	324		10.1016/S0304-4203(09)90024-X							WOS:A1991GZ58500022

Mapping Application for Penguin Populations and Projected Dynamics (MAPPPD): data and tools for dynamic management and decision support	POLAR RECORD												The Mapping Application for Penguin Populations and Projected Dynamics (MAPPPD) is a web-based, open access, decision-support tool designed to assist scientists, non-governmental organisations and policy-makers working to meet the management objectives as set forth by the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR) and other components of the Antarctic Treaty System (ATS) (that is, Consultative Meetings and the ATS Committee on Environmental Protection). MAPPPD was designed specifically to complement existing efforts such as the CCAMLR Ecosystem Monitoring Program (CEMP) and the ATS site guidelines for visitors. The database underlying MAPPPD includes all publicly available (published and unpublished) count data on emperor, gentoo, Adelie and chinstrap penguins in Antarctica. Penguin population models are used to assimilate available data into estimates of abundance for each site and year. Results are easily aggregated across multiple sites to obtain abundance estimates over any user-defined area of interest. A front end web interface located at www.penguinmap.com provides free and ready access to the most recent count and modelled data, and can act as a facilitator for data transfer between scientists and Antarctic stakeholders to help inform management decisions for the continent.

Evaluating and using stable-isotope analysis to infer diet composition and foraging ecology of Adelie penguins Pygoscelis adeliae	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												We investigated whether diet composition determined from stable-isotope analysis (SIA) was similar to that determined from stomach content analysis for Adelie penguins Pygoscelis adeliae. We also used SIA to compare diet composition of adults and chicks and to evaluate intra- and inter-annual variations in diet and foraging ecology of adults over 2 consecutive breeding seasons (2001-2002 and 2002-2003) and 3 consecutive moulting seasons (2000-2001 to 2002-2003). Diet determined from SIA closely mirrored that determined from stomach contents at the broad taxonomic level (i.e. fish vs. krill). Diet composition did not differ between adults and chicks, but the more depleted VC values of adult blood suggest that adults may forage for themselves and provide their chicks with food from different locations. Adult delta C-13 signatures varied intra-annually with the most depleted values measured during the arrival period, followed by incubation, guard and then creche. delta N-15 analyses indicated that krill and fish were being consumed prior to arrival at the breeding colonies and during incubation foraging trips, while the primary prey consumed during chick-rearing differed between years. delta(15) N did not vary in the pre-moult periods, with adult diet consisting primarily of krill in all 3 years, but the depleted VC signatures of feathers in 2000-2001 indicated that adults foraged farther from shore in that year. This study demonstrates that SIA is useful for monitoring diet and foraging areas of Adelie penguins at broad resolutions, particularly during periods when it is not possible to use conventional dietary techniques, although penguins may be most vulnerable to impacts such as commercial fishing during these periods as well.

Standardized sample data (log abundance per 1000 m(3)) were grouped into taxonomic categories and subjected to cluster analysis and multi-dimensional scaling. Two ordinations were performed, the first based on a reduced taxonomic dataset (31 categories out of a full 120) obtained by pooling ontogenetic stages within species and by including only those taxa that contributed at least 4% to total abundance at any one station. This disclosed two major station groups, which separated north and south, forming 'warm' and 'cold' water communities respectively, whereas four minor groups were mainly associated with stations around the Antarctic Peninsula and within the Weddell Scotia Confluence. Mean zooplankton abundance (238 000 individuals per 1000 m(3)) within the northerly group G1 was up to 12 times higher than in other groups. The second ordination using all taxonomic categories disclosed an additional intermediate group (G1a), which was geographically consistent with the southern part of the northern group 1 from the previous ordination. However, because of taxonomic similarities between all the major station groups it was concluded that they represented a single community, which differed only in its phenological development and the mass occurrence of patchily distributed organisms such as krill larvae. Testing the relationships of station groups with the position of water masses and frontal boundaries indicated that the Weddell Front was broadly coincident with the boundary of the northern and southern communities over much of its length. However, the presence of stations belonging to group G2, to the north of the Weddell Front, to the west of the Antarctic Peninsula, and around the South Sandwich Islands, was consistent with the distribution of ice-influenced surface water. Low zooplankton abundance and species developmental composition suggested that this 'community' was largely in an over-wintered state. Copepods and euphausiids dominated the mesozooplankton throughout the study area with small copepods (Oithona spp., Ctenocalanus spp. and Metridia spp.) particularly abundant. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

Review: the energetic value of zooplankton and nekton species of the Southern Ocean	MARINE BIOLOGY												Understanding the energy flux through food webs is important for estimating the capacity of marine ecosystems to support stocks of living resources. The energy density of species involved in trophic energy transfer has been measured in a large number of small studies, scattered over a 40-year publication record. Here, we reviewed energy density records of Southern Ocean zooplankton, nekton and several benthic taxa, including previously unpublished data. Comparing measured taxa, energy densities were highest in myctophid fishes (ranging from 17.1 to 39.3 kJ g(-1) DW), intermediate in crustaceans (7.1 to 25.3 kJ g(-1) DW), squid (16.2 to 24.0 kJ g(-1) DW) and other fish families (14.8 to 29.9 kJ g(-1) DW), and lowest in jelly fish (10.8 to 18.0 kJ g(-1) DW), polychaetes (9.2 to 14.2 kJ g(-1) DW) and chaetognaths (5.0-11.7 kJ g(-1) DW). Data reveals differences in energy density within and between species related to size, age and other life cycle parameters. Important taxa in Antarctic food webs, such as copepods, squid and small euphausiids, remain under-sampled. The variability in energy density of Electrona antarctica was likely regional rather than seasonal, although for many species with limited data it remains difficult to disentangle regional and seasonal variability. Models are provided to estimate energy density more quickly using a species' physical parameters. It will become increasingly important to close knowledge gaps to improve the ability of bioenergetic and food web models to predict changes in the capacity of Antarctic ecosystems to support marine life.

Herein, HMFS was prepared by Rhodococcus opacus fermentation. The substrate oils suitable for HMFS production were coconut oil (66.1-57.5%), soybean oil (17.5-26.5%), high oleic acid sunflower oil (5.4-4.5%), Antarctic krill oil (9-9.5%), and fungal oil (2%). Six HMFSs were prepared, among which HMFS V and VI were similar to human milk fat from Chinese in terms of fatty acid composition and triacylglycerol species. The sn-2 position of HMFS was occupied by palmitic acid (49.31 and 43.48% in HMFS V and VI, respectively). The major triacylglycerols were OPL, OPO, and LPL, accounting for 15.90, 9.49, and 6.84 and 17.52, 8.44, and 8.55% in HMFS V and VI, respectively. This study is the first to prepare structured lipids intended for infant formula through fermentation, providing a novel strategy for the edible oil industry.																	0021-8561	1520-5118				SEP 2	2020	68	35					9368	9376		10.1021/acs.jafc.0c03185							WOS:000569284100009	32700528

Random sequential addition simulations of animal aggregations provide null models of group structure	BIOINSPIRATION & BIOMIMETICS												Apparent structure in animal aggregations such as fish and Antarctic krill schools may result from the tight packing of these elongated animals. This geometrical structure may be difficult to differentiate from behavior-induced structure resulting from individuals preferentially taking up certain positions relative to conspecifics to gain an adaptive advantage such as reduced locomotive cost. Here we use random sequential addition (RSA) simulations to quantify the effect of animal shape, aggregation organization, and aggregation density on 2D school structure. This technique allows for the generation of a null model for nearest neighbor distance and nearest neighbor position angle for a specific body shape and aggregation density, thus isolating the effect of geometry from that of behavior. We further identify a shape-specific aggregation density threshold above which the animal shape affects the spatial distribution of nearest neighbors. Nearest neighbor distance data of fish schools with densities above and below the threshold are found to agree well with nearest neighbor statistics found from RSA-generated schools.																	1748-3182	1748-3190				MAY	2019	14	3							035001	10.1088/1748-3190/ab0b8b							WOS:000509126200001	30818295

However, average phytoplankton production values may not be completely representative, and local systems may exist where primary production is considerably higher Here. we examine the distribution of phytoplankton and nutrients along with physical oceanographic variables measured during two mesoscale surveys of two sites adjacent to South Georgia (January 1996 and December 1996-January 1997). Chlorophyll a concentrations were consistently higher (by up to an order of magnitude during one cruise) at the western end of the island (maximum >30 mg m(-3)). Surface phosphate and silicate at times appeared to have been depleted to particularly low levels (<0.8 and <2 mmol m(-3), respectively), whereas nitrate concentrations remained relatively high throughout the two surveys (similar to 14-30 mmol m(-3)). However. ammonium, a crucial reduced nitrogen source for South Georgia phytoplankton, was plentiful and widespread in the upper mixed layer during both surveys (maximum >3 mmol m(-3)). An examination of upper mixed layer nutrient dynamics showed an apparent shortfall in phytoplankton use of nitrate-nitrogen compared with silicate and phosphate at the western end of the island, where ammonium-nitrogen use appeared greatest. The western end of subantarctic island of South Georgia is noted for its large numbers of breeding Antarctic fur seals, Arctocephalus gazella, and macaroni penguins, Eudyptes chrysolophus, (similar to 2.6 x 10(6) and similar to 5.4 x 10(6) individuals, respectively). As land-breeding endotherms, these animals have high metabolic costs, and they recycle dietary nitrogen rapidly. Furthermore, because they take krill advected into their foraging range and return frequently to their colonies to feed pups and chicks, they concentrate nutrients close to the land. We evaluated the relationship between the preferential use of reduced nitrogen by phytoplankton and its production and concentration by the land-based predators (a minimum of 1 x 10(7) mol N d(-1) in January for the colonies in the study area). We examined the predators' potential for the redistribution of plankton nitrogen in an on-shelf environment where currents were relatively sluggish and encompassed retentive, eddy-like structures, which might have facilitated more stable conditions for phytoplankton growth.

J	Constable, AJ				Constable, Andrew J.			Lessons from CCAMLR on the implementation of the ecosystem approach to managing fisheries	FISH AND FISHERIES												The Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR) is widely recognized as a leading international organization in developing best practice in the ecosystem approach to managing fisheries. CCAMLR provides a useful case study for examining the impediments to implementing ecosystem-based fisheries management (EBFM) because it has EBFM principles embedded within its convention rather than having to make a transition from single-species management to an ecosystem approach. CCAMLR is demonstrating that (i) EBFM does not need to equate to complexity in management and (ii) methods can be developed to decide on spatial management strategies for fisheries so that predators of target species are not disproportionately affected as a result of spatial and/or temporal dependencies of predators on their prey. Science has an important role in implementing EBFM, not only in measuring and assessing the status of target species and their predators but also in designing cost-effective management strategies and in resolving disputes. Importantly, attention needs to be given to developing the capability and tools to overcome differences amongst scientists in providing advice to managers. The CCAMLR experience suggests that, without adequate safeguards, voluntary participation by fishing States in CCAMLR and its consensus environment do not provide strong foundations for achieving, in the long term, the ecosystem-based principles for managing fisheries when there is any degree of scientific uncertainty. Some solutions to these issues are discussed. Overall, broader-than-CCAMLR solutions amongst the international community as well as the continued commitment of CCAMLR Members will be required to resolve these issues.																	1467-2960	1467-2979				JUN	2011	12	2					138	151		10.1111/j.1467-2979.2011.00410.x							WOS:000290540700003

Average mesozooplankton biomass was 86.45 +/- 56.74 mg dry weight m(-2). which is in the lower range of the values cited in the literature for polar waters. Higher biomass was observed in the Weddell water. The small size fraction accounted for about 50% of total biomass while the largest one represented 35%. Rather high metabolic rates were found, irrespective of whether the organisms were incubated in the presence of food. No significant differences were observed in mass specific respiration and ammonia excretion rates between different temperatures of incubation (0.2-2.3 degrees C) and between the size classes studied. Because of the very low biomass values observed, the metabolic requirements of I nesozooplankton during December represented a small fraction of the primary production.

Water temperature correlates with baleen whale foraging behaviour at multiple scales in the Antarctic	MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH												How baleen whales locate prey and how environmental change may influence whale foraging success are not well understood. Baleen whale foraging habitat has largely been described at a population level, yet population responses to change are the result of individual strategies across multiple scales. This study aimed to determine how the foraging behaviour of individual whales varied relative to environmental conditions along their movement path. Biotelemetry devices provided information on humpback whale (Megaptera novaeangliae) movement at two spatial scales in East Antarctica, and a mixed modelling approach was used at a medium scale (tens of kilometres) to determine which environmental factors correlated with a change in foraging behaviour. Water temperature was linked to a change in foraging behaviour at both spatial scales. At the medium scale, warmer water was associated with the resident state, commonly assumed to represent periods of foraging behaviour. However, fine-scale analyses suggested that cooler water was associated with a higher feeding rate. Variation in whale foraging behaviour with changes in water temperature adds support to the hypothesis that whales may be able to track environmental conditions to find prey. Future research should investigate this pattern further, given the predicted rise in water temperatures under climate-change scenarios.																	1323-1650	1448-6059					2019	70	1					19	32		10.1071/MF17288							WOS:000453226400003						
J	Korb, RE; Whitehouse, M				Korb, RE; Whitehouse, M			Contrasting primary production regimes around South Georgia, Southern Ocean: large blooms versus high nutrient, low chlorophyll waters	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART I-OCEANOGRAPHIC RESEARCH PAPERS												During the austral summer of 2002, a large and persistent phytoplankton bloom was detected with SeaWiFS imagery in the Georgia Basin to the north-west of South Georgia, while waters to the east of the island were relatively unproductive. A British Antarctic Survey research cruise in January 2002 confirmed this west/east difference with production values of up to 2.5 g C m(-2) d(-1) and chlorophyll a (chl a) values up to 15 mg m(-3) at stations to the northwest of the island and 0.17 g C m(-2) d(-1) and 1.3 mg chl a m(-3) to the northeast. These differences were not attributable to light limitation as mixed layer depth never exceeded critical depth. Instead, substantial nutrient depletions to the northwest of the island compared with the northeast suggested a difference in nutrient use between the two regions. The exceedingly high nutrient depletions (to < 6.0 and 0.3 mmol m(-3) for NO3-N and PO4-P, respectively) measured to the northwest were associated with an anticyclonic eddy situated over the Northwest Georgia Rise. Furthermore, differences in NO3-N:PO4-P depletion ratios suggested a greater ability in the northwest phytoplankton to utilise NO3-N, and a greater dependence on NH4-N at the northeast stations. Three distinct station groups were identified around the island based on watermass and size-fractionated chlorophyll. To the east, waters were characterised by a high proportion of microplankton and low NO3-N:PO4-P depletion ratios, to the west, by either a high proportion of microplankton and high NO3-N:PO4-P depletion ratios, or a high proportion of nanoplankton and moderate NO3-N:PO4-P depletion ratios. We consider this to be indicative of greater Fe availability, promoting NO3-N use, to the northwest of South Georgia. However, an absence of microplankton over the western shelf regions may be due to size selective grazing by krill. Our field data, in conjunction with SeaWiFS imagery, indicated that the Georgia Basin phytoplankton most likely originated upstream of South Georgia. Subsequent interactions with the Northwest Georgia Rise and South Georgia's south-western shelf promoted increased growth that converged to the west of the island to form a large bloom in the Georgia Basin.

Assessing the adequacy of current fisheries management under changing climate: a southern synopsis	ICES JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE												Climate change is likely to have a significant impact on both target and non-target marine stocks worldwide, with the concomitant need for management strategies capable of sustaining fishing in future. We use several southern hemisphere fisheries to highlight the likely impacts of climate change at a range of levels, from individual to population responses, as well as ecosystem ramifications. Examples span polar (Antarctic krill fishery), temperate (west coast pelagic fishery, abalone and rock lobster), and tropical (Torres Strait rock lobster) commercially important fisheries. Responses of these fisheries to either past observed environmental changes or projected future changes are used to deduce some anticipated implications of climate change for fisheries management, including economic impacts and governance considerations. We evaluate the effectiveness of current single-species assessment models, management strategy evaluation approaches and multispecies assessment models as future management tools to cope with likely climate-related changes. Non-spatial stock assessment models will have limited ability to separate fishery effects from the impacts of climate change. Anthropogenic climate change is occurring at a time-scale relevant to current fisheries management strategic planning and testing. Adaptive management frameworks (with their feedback loops) are ideal for detecting and adapting to changes in target stocks.

J	Tiller, RG				Tiller, Rachel Gjelsvik			Regime Management at the Bottom of the Food Web	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENT & DEVELOPMENT												Fishing down the food chain is a controversial issue that demands further exploration. Redfeed is a marine species located on the second to last level on the food web. It is also one of the potential saviors of the aquaculture industry. The role of effective management of this species is of utmost importance to avoid the potential catastrophe associated with its overharvesting. Using a calculation of behavioral effectiveness, a blueprint redfeed regime is compared with the Convention for the Conservation of the Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR), an ecosystem-based management regime with the now famous krill as its key species. Though the regimes are similar in nature, their geopolitical differences suggest that a future redfeed regime will be effective even though CCAMLR has not been. Ensuring that the redfeed is not merely incorporated into existing regimes, but is treated separately in an ecosystem-based regime, will alleviate the interplay this future redfeed regime otherwise would encounter.

An energy-distance trade-off in a central-place forager, the Antarctic fur seal (Arctocephalus gazella)	MARINE BIOLOGY												We tested the prediction that lactating fur seals (Arctocephalus gazella) at South Georgia will take prey of greater energy density with increasing distance of foraging from the colony. The study investigated the differences in diet of fur seals foraging within two regions, one near the breeding colony and the other at greater distance. Diet varied significantly in relation to foraging location. Dietary items of low quality were eaten in both regions but more food items with a high-energy content appeared in the diet of seals travelling to distant oceanic waters. We conclude that there is likely to be a trade-off between energy gain and distance travelled which enables female fur seals to maintain a relatively constant rate of energy delivery to their offspring irrespective of the distance travelled to find food.

J	McQuinn, IH; Dion, M; St Pierre, JF				McQuinn, Ian H.; Dion, Maxime; St Pierre, Jean-Francois			The acoustic multifrequency classification of two sympatric euphausiid species (Meganyctiphanes norvegica and Thysanoessa raschii), with empirical and SDWBA model validation	ICES JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE												The ecosystem approach to fishery management requires monitoring capabilities at all trophic levels, including pelagic organisms. However, the usefulness of active acoustics for ecosystem monitoring has been limited by ambiguities in the identification of scattering layers. Increasingly, multifrequency acoustic methods are being developed for the classification of scattering layers into species or species groups. We describe a method for distinguishing between sympatric northern and Arctic krill (Meganyctiphanes norvegica and Thysanoessa raschii) using sv amplitude ratios from 38, 120, and 200 kHz data which were pre-processed through a self-noise removal algorithm. Acoustic frequency responses of both euphausiid species were predicted from species-specific parameterizations of a SDWBA physical model using specific body forms (shape, volume, and length) for Arctic and northern krill. Classification and model validation were achieved using macrozooplankton samples collected from multiple-sampler (BIONESS) and ringnet (JackNet) hauls, both equipped with a strobe light to reduce avoidance by euphausiids. SDWBA frequency responses were calculated for a range of orientations (+/- 45 degrees) and compared with observed frequency responses, solving for orientation by least squares. A tilt angle distribution of N[9 degrees,4 degrees] and N[12 degrees,6 degrees] for T. raschii and M. norvegica, respectively resulted in best fits. The models also provided species-specific TS-length relationships.

J	ARNTZ, WE; GORNY, M				ARNTZ, WE; GORNY, M			SHRIMP (DECAPODA, NATANTIA) OCCURRENCE AND DISTRIBUTION IN THE EASTERN WEDDELL SEA, ANTARCTICA	POLAR BIOLOGY												108 successful ground and Agassiz trawl catches were taken between 155 and 2031 m depth in the eastern Weddell Sea on board RV Polarstern in spring and summer (October-February) 1985-1989. In addition, 7 hauls were taken with a semipelagic trawl. Only 19 hauls (16.5%) contained no shrimps. The others yielded large numbers of Notocrangon antarcticus, Chorismus antarcticus, and Nematocarcinus lanceopes as well as 20 Lebbeus antarcticus and 11 specimens of an Eualus species new to science. 8 Pasiphaea scotiae were caught in a pelagic krill trawl. No reptant decapod crustaceans were detected in the study area. Shrimp densities determined from trawl catches were lower than estimates derived from underwater photography but in the same order of magnitude. Although yields of the three common shrimp species in some cases exceeded 20 kg per 0.5 h haul, shrimp stocks in the area cannot be considered to be of commercial significance. A wider geographical distribution and greater frequency of shrimps in high Antarctic waters was found than described hitherto. There was considerable variation in numbers, sex composition, occurrence at different depths, and size-frequency distributions. C. antarcticus and N. antarcticus grow to a larger size compared with individuals from the Antarctic Peninsula area. Within the area of investigation, length frequency distributions are skewed towards larger sizes at higher latitudes. In the eastern Weddell Sea larger specimens of the three common species live at greater depths than smaller individuals. Potential reasons for these differences are discussed.																	0722-4060					JUN	1991	11	3					169	177									WOS:A1991FU68700003						
J	PIATKOWSKI, U; PUTZ, K				PIATKOWSKI, U; PUTZ, K			SQUID DIET OF EMPEROR PENGUINS (APTENODYTES-FORSTERI) IN THE EASTERN WEDDELL SEA, ANTARCTICA DURING LATE SUMMER	ANTARCTIC SCIENCE												The data presented provides new information on the distribution of Antarctic squids and on the summer diet of the emperor penguins. The diet of 58 adult emperor penguins (Aptenodytes forsteri) on the fast ice of the Drescher Inlet, Vestkapp Ice Shelf (72-degrees-52'S, 19-degrees-25'W) in the eastern Weddell Sea was investigated. Prey consisted principally of squid, fish, krill, amphipods and isopods. Squids were identified by the lower beaks and allometric equations were used to estimate the squid biomass represented. Beaks occurred in 93% of the stomach samples. Each sample contained a mean of 27 beaks (range 1-206). Ninety-two percent of the squids could be identified by the lower beaks and belonged to four families (Onychoteuthidae, Psychroteuthidae, Neoteuthidae and Gonatidae). The most abundant squid was Psychroteuthis glacialis which occurred in 52 samples with lower rostral lengths (LRL) ranging from 1.4-7.2 mm. Forty-five samples contained Alluroteuthis antarcticus (LRL range 1.8-5.8 mm), 17 Kondakovia longimana (LRL range 4-12.1 mm), and four Gonatus antarcticus (LRL range 4.1-6.1 mm). In terms of biomass K. longimana was the most important species taken by the penguins comprising 50% of total estimated squid wet mass (245348 g) in 1990 and 48% in 1992 (154873 g). However, if only fresh beaks were considered for estimations of squid consumption, i.e. beaks that have been accumulated for not longer than 5-6 days in the stomachs, squid diet was of minor importance. Then total squid wet mass accounted for only 4809 g in 1990 and 5445 g in 1992 which implies that one penguin took c. 30 g squid d-1 with P. glacialis and A. antarcticus being the most important by mass. The prey composition suggests that emperor penguins take squid at the steep slope regions of the eastern Weddell Sea.

J	JACKSON, S; PLACE, AR; SEIDERER, LJ				JACKSON, S; PLACE, AR; SEIDERER, LJ			CHITIN DIGESTION AND ASSIMILATION BY SEABIRDS	AUK												As a structural component of crustacean exoskeletons, chitin is the most important carbohydrate in the diets of many marine carnivores. To investigate the physiological and biochemical adaptations that may enable seabirds to break down this ''prey defense,'' we estimated chitin digestibilities for Sooty Albatrosses (Phoebetria fusca), White-chinned Petrels (Procellaria aequinoctialis), Rockhopper Penguins (Eudyptes chrysocome), Gentoo Penguins (Pygoscelis papua), King Penguins (Aptenodytes patagonicus) and Leach's Storm-Petrels (Oceanodroma leucorhoa) fed Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba). These species retain a substantial proportion (46.5 +/- SD of 13.1%, 39.1 +/- 4.9%, 52.8 +/- 37.6%, 45.3 +/- 5.6%, 84.8 +/- 11.7% and 35 +/- 12.2%, respectively) of ingested chitin. We also obtained preliminary estimates of chitinolytic activity in the gastric mucosae of the above six species by incubating extracts of tissue samples with a chitin substrate and measuring the production of the end product of chitin hydrolysis, N-acetyl-D-glucosamine (NAG). Chitinolytic activity (up to 5,000 mug NAG h-1 g-1 expressed per gram tissue) was measured from proventricular tissue and within the activity range (1,350 to 61,650,ug NAG h-1 g-1) reported for eight other avian species. In order to assess the energetic and nutritional benefits of chitinolytic activity in seabirds, we studied gastrointestinal absorption of the end products of chitinolysis in Leach's Storm-Petrels. The overall absorption efficiency of NAG and its deacetylated precursor, glucosamine (Gln), in this species was 44.0 +/- 3.0% and 11.0 +/- 1.9%, respectively. These absorption efficiencies were significantly less than for glucose, which was absorbed with an efficiency of 90.6 +/- 2.5%. No absorption of NAG and Gln occurred in the proventriculus. Overall, we showed that seabirds have a capacity to assimilate a considerable portion of the carbon and nitrogen present as chitin in the exoskeleton of their prey, but we have not demonstrated that assimilation actually occurs. The potential costs and benefits of chitin hydrolysis, as well as the absorption of the breakdown products, need to be assessed.

J	Bugoni, L; McGill, RAR; Furness, RW				Bugoni, Leandro; McGill, Rona A. R.; Furness, Robert W.			The importance of pelagic longline fishery discards for a seabird community determined through stable isotope analysis	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY												Seabird species within a community are expected to have distinct trophic niches according to foraging methods and body size, but some seabirds exploit fishery waste which can be quite distinct from natural foods. Even in the presence of fishery discards we hypothesize that a pelagic seabird community is structured according to body size, feeding methods, and access to discards. We measured carbon and nitrogen stable isotopes in whole blood of seabirds from the offshore wintering community of Procellariiformes (albatrosses, petrels, shearwaters and storm-petrels) in the SW Atlantic Ocean. We compared this with isotope values of potential prey items and fishery discards, to investigate the importance of discards from the tuna-shark pelagic longline fishery in the diet of these birds. Despite contrasting body masses and feeding techniques, there was extensive overlap in the range of isotopic ratios for different species. Carbon isotope values were typical of the subtropical offshore region. Nitrogen values also showed a high degree of overlap among species and clearly signify that the birds are feeding on fishery waste (especially shark liver). Recently arrived migrants from the Antarctic and sub-Antarctic, and species still rearing chicks when sampled (e.g. wandering albatross Diomedea exulans) had carbon isotopic values indicative of Antarctic and sub-Antarctic regions. All species breeding at more southerly latitudes underwent a marked shift (increase) in carbon and nitrogen isotopes, indicating a change in diet between breeding and wintering seasons. Cory's shearwater (Calonectris diomedea), the only sampled species not attending vessels, had low nitrogen values reflecting a diet of flying fish which occur naturally in the area and showed no change in isotope values between breeding and wintering grounds. Mixing models demonstrate the need to include an external food source (Antarctic krill) to recreate the isotope values obtained from seabird blood: this corresponds to the blood of wintering migrants retaining a minor component from their diet in the southern breeding grounds. The stable isotope results suggest that the availability of discards from pelagic fisheries in the SW Atlantic Ocean lead to an artificially and poorly structured seabird community, with most species utilizing the same food resource. The balance between population benefits obtained from feeding upon otherwise unavailable discards, and the costs from incidental mortality on longline fishing hooks is likely to differ among species, with positive effects for small-sized species and negative effects on albatrosses and Procellaria petrels.

Food web structure and biogeochemical processes during oceanic phytoplankton blooms: An inverse model analysis	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY												The relationship between food web structure and function across two ocean biomes was investigated using an inverse method to recover solutions of food web carbon flows. We estimated the carbon exchanges between major assemblages within plankton food webs in the North Atlantic, using the JGOFS NABE data set (1989) and near the Western Antarctic Peninsula (WAP), using the Palmer Station LTER data set, two areas exhibiting strong seasonal phytoplankton blooms. The recovery of all the potential flows of carbon allowed a system-level analysis, providing insight to processes that are seldom measured in the field and a means of comparing food webs from different regions. In the NABE food web, the dominant carbon flows involved the microorganisms including bacterial carbon demand and grazing by microzooplankton and protozoans. In the WAP food web, krill had the most significant carbon flows including grazing of large phytoplankton and respiration. A comparison between the NABE and the WAP carbon-based food webs showed key differences. Recycling and the activity of the microbial food web were much greater in the NABE food web than in the WAP. However in the WAP inverse solution, the microbial food web was just as important as the classical food web (diatoms to krill to penguins) that is traditionally believed to dominate carbon flows. Carbon flows through the NABE and WAP regions were more highly dependent on recycling than would be anticipated from the size structure of the primary producers, when analyzed using a classification scheme of Legendre, L., Rassoulzadegan, F [1996.

To investigate penguins' seasonally changing FTD as a function of foraging population size-previously investigated indirectly-we used bio-logging to determine the penguins' 3-dimensional foraging volume, while an autonomous glider quantified the depth, abundance, and distribution of potential prey. As numbers of foraging penguins and cetaceans increased, penguins spent more time on foraging trips, traveling farther and deeper, and their diet included more fish, as average maximum depth of krill increased from 45 to 65 m, and that of small fish also deepened, but only from 51 to 57 m. With a need to forage at greater depths for in creasingly over lapping prey, the penguins consumed more of the energy-dense fish. Krill depth was negatively correlated with chlorophyll (a proxy for krill food), indicating an uncoupling between the two and the overwhelming importance of predation avoidance by the krill relative to food acquisition. Results support the hypotheses that (1) predators remove the grazers from Ross Sea surface waters, controlling their vertical distributions; and (2) the food web has a 'wasp-waist' structure, in which middle-and upper-trophic levels are controlled top-down, whereas phytoplank ton production and accumulation are regulated bottom-up, largely independent of grazer control. Ross Sea models need revision to reflect this food web structure.

Here, we investigated the inter- and intra-specific differences using stable isotope analyses in the black-bellied storm-petrel (Fregetta tropica) and the Wilson's storm-petrel (Oceanites oceanicus), breeding sympatrically in maritime Antarctica. We analysed stable carbon, nitrogen and oxygen isotopes in samples representing different life stages; chick down (pre-laying females), chick feather (chick), and adult blood (chick-rearing adults). Pre-laying females had wider stable isotope niches than chicks or chick-rearing adults, due to pre-laying females being free roaming while chick-rearing adults were central-place-foragers. Chicks were fed at a higher trophic level than the adults (higher delta N-15), likely to compensate for the high nutritional demands of the growing chicks. Wilson's storm-petrels showed substantial overlap in stable isotope niches between all life stages, while the black-bellied storm-petrel chicks showed very little overlap. Wilson's storm-petrel niches significantly overlapped with those of pre-laying and chick-rearing black-bellied storm-petrels, suggesting negligible niche partitioning. Chick growth rate was negatively correlated with chick delta N-15 values, suggesting nutritional stress resulting in the use endogenous instead of dietary amino acids in protein synthesis. The higher trophic level of the relatively larger black-bellied storm-petrel chicks may be due to their longer stay in the nest, and relatively larger body mass gain, despite chick growth rates being similar to the smaller Wilson's storm-petrel chicks. Despite breeding sympatrically, the studied storm-petrel species showed considerable overlap in isotopic niches, which may be explained by sharing the same main prey species, reducing the detectability of foraging niche partitioning through stable isotope analyses. We found dietary shifts in black-bellied storm-petrels that are absent in Wilson's, showing different chick provisioning strategies, and shows that the high productivity of the Antarctic marine ecosystem may facilitate foraging niche overlap of sympatrically living species.

In the present scenario, these wastes are treated chemically to recover chitin by the chitin and chitosan industries, using hazardous chemicals like HCl and NaOH. Although this process is efficient in removing proteins and minerals, the unscientific dumping of harmful effluents is hazardous to the ecosystem. Stringent environmental laws and regulations on waste disposal have encouraged researchers to look for alternate strategies to produce near-zero wastes on shellfish degradation. The role of enzymes in degrading shellfish wastes is advantageous yet has not been explored much, although it produces bioactive rich protein hydrolysates with good quality chitin. The main objective of the review is to discuss the potential of various enzymes involved in shellfish degradation and their opportunities and challenges over chemical processes in chitin recovery.

We wished to determine if prey quality explained different population growth and emigration rates among colonies. Diet composition was described both by conventional means (stomach samples) and by analysis of stable isotopes in chick tissues (toenails of individuals killed by skuas [Stercorarius maccormicki]). Diets were similar among the four study colonies compared to the disparity apparent among 14 widely spaced sites around the continent. Calorimetry indicated that fish are more energetically valuable than krill, implying that if diet varied by colony, diet quality could attract recruits and help to explain differential rates of colony growth. However, a multiple-regression analysis indicated that diet varied as a function of year, time within the year, and percent of foraging area covered by sea ice, but not by colony location. Stable isotopes revealed similarity of diet at one colony where conventional sampling was not possible. We confirmed that sea ice importantly affects diet composition of this species in neritic waters, and found that (1) quality of summer diet cannot explain different population growth rates among colonies, and (2) stable isotope analysis of chick tissues (toenails) is a useful tool to synoptically describe diet in this species over a large area.																	0010-5422					FEB	2003	105	1					95	106		10.1650/0010-5422(2003)105[95:SATVOD]2.0.CO;2							WOS:000181130200009

Circulation patterns differ strikingly between the north and south. Meridional circulation in the north provides connections between the sub-Arctic and Arctic despite the presence of encircling continental landmasses, whereas annular circulation patterns in the south tend to isolate Antarctic surface waters from those in the north. These differences influence fundamental aspects of the polar ecosystems from the amount, thickness and duration of sea ice, to the types of organisms, and the ecology of zooplankton, fish, seabirds and marine mammals. Meridional flows in both the North Pacific and the North Atlantic oceans transport heat, nutrients, and plankton northward into the Chukchi Sea, the Barents Sea, and the seas off the west coast of Greenland. In the North Atlantic, the advected heat warms the waters of the southern Barents Sea and, with advected nutrients and plankton, supports immense biomasses of fish, seabirds and marine mammals. On the Pacific side of the Arctic, cold waters flowing northward across the northern Bering and Chukchi seas during winter and spring limit the ability of boreal fish species to take advantage of high seasonal production there. Southward flow of cold Arctic waters into sub-Arctic regions of the North Atlantic occurs mainly through Fram Strait with less through the Barents Sea and the Canadian Archipelago. In the Pacific, the transport of Arctic waters and plankton southward through Bering Strait is minimal. In the Southern Ocean, the Antarctic Circumpolar Current and its associated fronts are barriers to the southward dispersal of plankton and pelagic fishes from sub-Antarctic waters, with the consequent evolution of Antarctic zooplankton and fish species largely occurring in isolation from those to the north. The Antarctic Circumpolar Current also disperses biota throughout the Southern Ocean, and as a result, the biota tends to be similar within a given broad latitudinal band. South of the Southern Boundary of the ACC, there is a large-scale divergence that brings nutrient-rich water to the surface. This divergence, along with more localized upwelling regions and deep vertical convection in winter, generates elevated nutrient levels throughout the Antarctic at the end of austral winter. However, such elevated nutrient levels do not support elevated phytoplankton productivity through the entire Southern Ocean, as iron concentrations are rapidly removed to limiting levels by spring blooms in deep waters. However, coastal regions, with the upward mixing of iron, maintain greatly enhanced rates of production, especially in coastal polynyas. In these coastal areas, elevated primary production supports large biomasses of zoo plankton, fish, seabirds, and mammals. As climate warming affects these advective processes and their heat content, there will likely be major changes in the distribution and abundance of polar biota, in particular the biota dependent on sea ice.

However, the produced chitin in marine ecosystems is principally by crustaceans. A comparative study of analytical data so far available allowed calculation of chitin biomass and chitin production values in some types of marine ecosystems, and thus estimation of the quantitative importance of chitin in the biogeochemical cycles of carbon and nitrogen. The main data so far available concerns mediterranean plankton in Calvi bay (Corsica), arctic and antarctic krill, lobster population on South African coasts, and infralittoral benthic communities growing on rocky substrates on Corsica coasts. In all these cases, chitin production was estimated roughly at 1g per year and per square meter of rocky substrate or sea surface. Taking into account these production values and the relative extent of the main marine ecosystems over the world, the total production of chitin due to marine crustaceans was estimated at about 2.3 billion metric tons per year.																	0990-7440	1765-2952				OCT-DEC	1993	6	4					331	341		10.1051/alr:1993034							WOS:000209779600005

On the other hand, despite the high abundance and biomass, the distribution patterns of micro- (20-200 mu m) and meso-sized (200 mu m-2 mm) zooplankton communities are little understood. In this study, we investigated the distribution patterns of larger micro-zooplankton (100-200 mu m) and meso-zooplankton communities in the seasonal ice zone in the Cosmonaut Sea near Syowa Station and examined the effects of environmental factors and water properties on these communities. The investigation was based on samples collected with 100 mm mesh nets, which are appropriate to estimate the quantitative abundance and community structure of micro- and meso-zooplankton species between 1983 and 1995. Cluster analysis of the samples revealed that the distribution of macro-zooplankton species was influenced by the temperature and salinity of ocean fronts. Among the meso-zooplankton, cyclopoid and small calanoid copepods tended to be ubiquitously distributed. However, among the micro-zooplankton, the distributions of foraminiferans and tintinnids were associated with sea ice extent. The distribution of micro- and meso-zooplankton communities could be used to estimate the impact of environmental changes on the marine ecosystem in the Southern Ocean.

J	Smith, WO; Delizo, LM; Herbolsheimer, C; Spencer, E				Smith, Walker O.; Delizo, Liza M.; Herbolsheimer, Courtney; Spencer, Erin			Distribution and abundance of mesozooplankton in the Ross Sea, Antarctica	POLAR BIOLOGY												Zooplankton (meso- and macrozooplankton) distributions and biomass are poorly known in the Ross Sea despite their importance in energy transfer within food webs and biogeochemical cycles. Mesozooplankton abundance and biomass on the continental shelf are spatially variable and span two orders of magnitude during austral summer. Selected sub-regions (near the shelf break or ice shelf) show similar variability, suggesting that other processes, either oceanographic or biological, influence zooplankton on smaller scales. Biomass at one location (76.5A degrees S, 172A degrees E) was consistently elevated throughout January, although the causes of this "hotspot" were unclear. At a station near the ice shelf, abundance and biomass of the pteropod Limacina antarctica was very high. Zooplankton biomass at this location was sevenfold greater than any other station, and while the high biomass was driven by pteropod contributions, copepods were also abundant. Copepods dominated the mesozooplankton composition at all other stations, comprising 90 and 78% on average of the total abundance and biomass. Zooplankton biomass comprised on average 3.96% of the total particulate carbon (0-200 m) and was weakly correlated with chlorophyll and biogenic silica. We suggest that summer zooplankton growth and biomass, while linked to organic matter concentrations, are regulated by other factors (e.g., predation by crystal krill and Antarctic silverfish), as both grazers may be responsible for significant losses. Our data indicate that, contrary to other suggestions, summer zooplankton biomass and abundance in the Ross Sea are similar to those in other Antarctic coastal regions.

Widely used marine seismic survey air gun operations negatively impact zooplankton	NATURE ECOLOGY & EVOLUTION												Zooplankton underpin the health and productivity of global marine ecosystems. Here we present evidence that suggests seismic surveys cause significant mortality to zooplankton populations. Seismic surveys are used extensively to explore for petroleum resources using intense, low-frequency, acoustic impulse signals. Experimental air gun signal exposure decreased zooplankton abundance when compared with controls, as measured by sonar (similar to 3-4dB drop within 15-30 min) and net tows (median 64% decrease within 1 h), and caused a two-to threefold increase in dead adult and larval zooplankton. Impacts were observed out to the maximum 1.2 km range sampled, which was more than two orders of magnitude greater than the previously assumed impact range of 10 m. Although no adult krill were present, all larval krill were killed after air gun passage. There is a significant and unacknowledged potential for ocean ecosystem function and productivity to be negatively impacted by present seismic technology.

J	El-Sayed, SZ				El-Sayed, SZ			History and evolution of primary productivity studies of the Southern Ocean	POLAR BIOLOGY												The main objective of the article is to give an overview of the history and evolution of phytoplankton research in the Southern Ocean during the past century and a half. It traces the evolution of phytoplankton investigations as it went through several phases commencing with intensive collecting and cataloging and leading to the Discovery investigations with its extensive and detailed studies of Southern Ocean phytoplankton. Following, in the footsteps of the Discovery was the USNS Eltanin with its specialized cruises that centered around the study of the ecology of the primary producers and the dynamics of the lower trophic levels of the food chain. Spurred by the findings of the Eltanin cruises and with the growing concern over the impending exploitation of the Antarctic marine living resources, in particular krill, the BIOMASS program was initiated. The program was the first international collaborative effort to study the dynamic functioning of the Antarctic marine ecosystem. The success of the program has rekindled great international interest in the Southern Ocean which resulted in an explosion of programs such as SO-JGOFS, SO-GLOBEC, EPOS, and several others. In recent years, there has been a major shift in phytoplankton research in the Southern Ocean. This was in response to worldwide concern over the effects of global warming and stratospheric ozone depletion on species diversity, primary production and ecosystem function. This has led to process-oriented programs to study phenomena and processes of global significance in which Antarctica and its surrounding seas play key roles.																	0722-4060	1432-2056				MAY	2005	28	6					423	438		10.1007/s00300-004-0685-2							WOS:000229110300001

Fatty acid composition and volatile compounds of selected marine oils and meals	JOURNAL OF THE SCIENCE OF FOOD AND AGRICULTURE												BACKGROUND: Although volatile compounds characterising seafood have been studied extensively, no similar data are available regarding the volatiles of raw materials used in fish feed. Therefore the aim of this study was to make an initial screening of the volatiles of various common marine raw materials used in the aquaculture feed industry. Nine commercial marine oils (German (GFO1, GFO2 and GFO3) and Norwegian (NFO) fish oils and salmon (SO1 and SO2), tuna (TO), sardine (SRDO) and shrimp (SHO) oils) and eight commercial marine meals (Peruvian (PFM1 and PFM2), Danish (DFM1 and DFM2) and prime quality (PQFM1 and PQFM2) fish meals and Antarctic krill meals (KM1 and KM2)) were analysed for their fatty acid profiles and volatile flavour compounds. The relation between fatty acids and volatiles was examined. RESULTS: The highest polyunsaturated fatty acid and eicosapentaenoic acid (20:5 omega 3) contents and omega 3/omega 6 ratio were found in NFO. The fatty acid composition of all marine meals except krill meals was found to be more variable among batches than that of marine oils. Regarding volatiles, all marine raw materials were characterised by the complete absence or negligible levels of eight- and nine-carbon alcohols and carbonyls. All marine oils were found to have high 2-ethyl furan, 2-methylenebutyl cyclopropane, hexanal, 2,4-octadiene and 3,5-octadiene contents. Marine meals, unlike marine oils, were characterised by the almost complete absence of unsaturated and cyclic hydrocarbons and terpenes and very low levels of furans. CONCLUSION: Volatiles of marine meals differ from those of marine oils. Unlike fatty acids which give useful traceability information, volatiles seem to fail in this role owing to their strong variability. 2008 Society of Chemical Industry				Grigorakis, Kriton/H-6321-2019	Grigorakis, Kriton/0000-0002-3367-7160												0022-5142	1097-0010				JAN 15	2009	89	1					88	100		10.1002/jsfa.3414							WOS:000261773500012						
J	Goss, C; Middleton, D; Rodhouse, P				Goss, C; Middleton, D; Rodhouse, P			Investigations of squid stocks using acoustic survey methods	FISHERIES RESEARCH					1st International Symposium on Pacific Squids	OCT, 1999	TRUJILLO, PERU	IMARPE				Acoustic survey methods are now widely used for stock assessments of finfish, both those with and without swimbladders, but their application to squid stocks has been limited in the past, probably because squid are not particularly strong targets for detection with echosounders. Experience with acoustic stock assessment of krill (Euphausia superba) has revealed that it is possible to survey effectively for a species that is a weaker target than squid; this is partly due to the tendency for krill to form dense aggregations. This paper discusses examples of acoustic studies on different squid species from the South Atlantic (Loligo gahi, Martialia hyadesi) and demonstrates that squid detection is possible in widely differing locations. L gahi observed during a survey on the Falkland Shelf were shown to have acoustic characteristics in common with smaller organisms which may enable them to be distinguished acoustically from finfish encountered in these waters. When a species has been characterised acoustically, the technique permits rapid surveys of large areas to determine the geographic range of a population, both outside the usual area that can be surveyed using fishing methods and within areas that are inaccessible to nets for some reason.

J	Lara-Lopez, AL; Davison, P; Koslow, JA				Lara-Lopez, Ana Ligia; Davison, Peter; Koslow, Julian Anthony			Abundance and community composition of micronekton across a front off Southern California	JOURNAL OF PLANKTON RESEARCH												Concurrent net and acoustic data were collected across a front off Southern California to assess its influence on the abundance, biomass and community composition of the micronekton. Higher abundance and biomass of vertically migratory mesopelagic fish (VMF) and euphausiids were found on the cooler mesotrophic (north) side of the front, whereas larval fish abundance was higher on the warmer oligotrophic (south) side. The biomass and community composition of non-VMF did not differ between the two sides of the front. The north was dominated by the euphausiid Euphausia pacifica and the myctophid Diaphus theta, whereas the south was dominated by E. gibboides, E. recurva and a combination of VMF species with warm water affinities. The larval fish assemblage in the north was dominated by the nearshore species Engraulis mordax and Citharichthys spp., whereas mesopelagic fish larvae dominated the south. Acoustic data revealed differences in the distribution of fish, euphausiids and the deep-scattering layer across the front. In particular, epipelagic fish were aggregated directly at the frontal interface in the area of enhanced plankton concentrations and may have contributed to higher plankton mortality and turnover rates at the front. In addition to being an area of high biological abundance, the front may be acting as a distributional boundary for several migratory species, as well as a locus of enhanced prey forage and the activity of epipelagic species.

J	PARK, C; WORMUTH, JH				PARK, C; WORMUTH, JH			DISTRIBUTION OF ANTARCTIC ZOOPLANKTON AROUND ELEPHANT-ISLAND DURING THE AUSTRAL SUMMERS OF 1988, 1989, AND 1990	POLAR BIOLOGY												Year to year variation and vertical distributions of epipelagic zooplankton around Elephant Island and King George Island were examined with samples collected with bongo nets and a 1 m2 MOCNESS during the austral summers (Jan. Feb.) of 1988, 1989 and 1990. Copepods were the major components of epipelagic zooplankton (in numbers) with dominance of Metridia gerlachei (1988 and 1989) and small calanoids and cyclopoids (1990). Euphausiids and salps were the next most abundant groups. The percent composition of euphausiids decreased from 1988 to 1990 while that of salps increased. The abundance of salps exceeded euphausiids and major taxa of copepods in 1990. Local patches of polychaetes and amphipods were also found. Statistically significant annual variations with increased numbers in 1990 were found by analyses of variance in total abundance, abundances of copepods, salps, chaetognaths and amphipods, but abundances of euphausiids, polychaetes and fishes showed no significant annual variations. When the study area was divided geographically, horizontal variability in abundance within each year showed no significance in total abundance, abundances of copepods, euphausiids, amphipods and fishes, but significance in salps, polychaetes and chaetognaths. Results of site clustering based on covariances of abundances of eleven major taxa were well matched, though not perfect, with the distribution of surface water temperatures which could be used as a tracer of source water masses suggesting that spatial variation was related to hydrodynamic conditions. Factor analyses showed that annual and spatial variations in abundance were mainly caused by only two taxa, Metridia gerlachei and salps (mostly Salpa thompsoni). These two taxa were responsible for about 60% and 30% of total variance, respectively, and were useful indicators of the interannual variation. That is, 1988 and 1989 were the years of M. gerlachei, and 1990 was the year of salps. From vertically stratified MOCNESS samples, it was shown that the major taxa in this study area were active vertical migrators. While most samples obtained by relatively shallow tows (uppermost 100 m depth) were composed of exclusively one or two taxa, those from relatively deep tows (down to 200 m) showed various patterns of vertical stratification suggesting that the patterns of vertical migration were species specific. Species specific ontogenetic vertical migration associated with elevated habitat temperatures also seemed to be responsible for the annual variation in zooplankton distribution in the upper water column.																	0722-4060					MAY	1993	13	4					215	225									WOS:A1993LC53500001						
J	Cisewski, B; Strass, VH				Cisewski, Boris; Strass, Volker H.			Acoustic insights into the zooplankton dynamics of the eastern Weddell Sea	PROGRESS IN OCEANOGRAPHY												The success of any efforts to determine the effects of climate change on marine ecosystems depends on understanding in the first instance the natural variations, which contemporarily occur on the interannual and shorter time scales. Here we present results on the environmental controls of zooplankton distribution patterns and behaviour in the eastern Weddell Sea, Southern Ocean. Zooplankton abundance and vertical migration are derived from the mean volume backscattering strength (MVBS) and the vertical velocity measured by moored acoustic Doppler current profilers (ADCPs), which were deployed simultaneously at 64 degrees S, 66.5 degrees S and 69 degrees S along the Greenwich Meridian from February, 2005, until March, 2008. While these time series span a period of full three years they resolve hourly changes. A highly persistent behavioural pattern found at all three mooring locations is the synchronous diel vertical migration (DVM) of two distinct groups of zooplankton that migrate between a deep residence depth during daytime and a shallow depth during nighttime. The DVM was closely coupled to the astronomical daylight cycles. However, while the DVM was symmetric around local noon, the annual modulation of the DVM was clearly asymmetric around winter solstice or summer solstice, respectively, at all three mooring sites. DVM at our observation sites persisted throughout winter, even at the highest latitude exposed to the polar night. Since the magnitude as well as the relative rate of change of illumination is minimal at this time, we propose that the ultimate causes of DVM separated from the light mediated proximal cue that coordinates it. In all three years, a marked change in the migration behaviour occurred in late spring (late October/early November), when DVM ceased. The complete suspension of DVM after early November is possibly caused by the combination of two factors: (1) increased availability of food in the surface mixed layer provided by the phytoplankton spring bloom, and (2) vanishing diurnal enhancement of the threat from visually oriented predators when the illumination is quasi-continuous during the polar and subpolar summer. Zooplankton abundance in the water column, estimated as the mean MVBS in the depth range 50-300 m, was highest end of summer and lowest mid to end winter on the average annual cycle. However, zooplankton abundance varied several-fold between years and between locations. Based on satellite and in situ data of chlorophyll and sea ice as well as on hydrographic measurements, the inter annual and spatial variations of zooplankton mean abundance can be explained by differences in the magnitude of the phytoplankton spring bloom, which develops during the seasonal sea ice retreat. Whereas the vernal ice melt appears necessary to stimulate the blooming of phytoplankton, it is not the determinator of the blooms magnitude, its areal extent and duration. A possible explanation for the limitation of the phytoplankton bloom in some years is top-down control. We hypothesise that the phytoplankton spring development can be curbed by grazing when the zooplankton had attained high abundance by growth during the preceding summer. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

We estimated foraging ranges and prey capture rates, and compared foraging behavior with that of breeding (chick-rearing) birds. Foraging was highly diurnal with 98% of foraging trips completed during the same day. Foraging-trip frequency was 0.8/day, trip duration was 6-8 h, and birds spent 51-62% of the foraging trip diving. Dive depth and duration were bimodal. Shallow dives (< 21 m; 42% of total number and 16% of total dive time) averaged 5-7 m and 0.5-1.3 min. Deep dives (> 30 m; 55% of total number and 81% of dive time) averaged 74-105 m and 2.7-3.5 min, respectively. Deep-dive duration exceeded the subsequent surface interval, but shallow dives were followed by surface intervals two to three times dive duration. Deep dives showed clear diel patterns, averaging 10-20 m at dawn and dusk and 70-90 m at midday. These results are consistent with the patchy vertical and horizontal distribution and diel movements of Antarctic krill, the main winter prey of Gentoo Penguins (including study birds). We suggest that shallow dives are mainly searching dives, and deep dives mainly for feeding. Foraging activity of nonbreeding Gentoo Penguins in winter is similar to that of chick-rearing birds. The only major differences are that foraging-trip frequency is 20% less and stomach-content mass on return ashore 30% less in winter. We conclude that foraging activity in Gentoo Penguins is changed by varying the frequency and duration of foraging trips, rather than by changing the pattern and rate of diving.

Distribution, population structure and trophodynamics of Southern Ocean Gymnoscopelus (Myctophidae) in the Scotia Sea	POLAR BIOLOGY												Gymnoscopelus braueri, Gymnoscopelus fraseri and Gymnoscopelus nicholsi are common in the Southern Ocean mesopelagic fish community. However, their ecology is poorly understood in the region. This study investigated spatial and temporal patterns in their abundance, population structure and diets at different times of year within the Scotia Sea to ascertain their functional role in the pelagic food web. G. braueri was the most abundant species (0.07-0.17 ind. 1,000 m(-3)) throughout the Scotia Sea. G. fraseri was absent from the sea-ice sectors and occurred mostly around the Antarctic Polar Front (APF), comprising densities of 0.01-0.04 ind. 1,000 m(-3). G. nicholsi occurred in low abundance (< 0.01 ind. 1,000 m(-3)) throughout the region. G. braueri and G. fraseri had a lifespan of 4 and 3 years, respectively, but spatial variation in their population structures was evident and recruitment appeared to occur only around the APF. G. nicholsi had a lifespan of > 4 years. There was evidence of seasonal variation in depth distribution, size-related sexual dimorphism and vertical segregation in size classes for each species. Overall, diets were dominated by copepods (Metridia spp., Rhincalanus gigas, Pleuromamma robusta) and euphausiids (Thysanoessa spp. and Euphausia superba), although G. fraseri did not predate E. superba. Regional, seasonal and ontogenetic patterns in diet were evident for all species. This study provides new insight into the ecology of these Gymnoscopelus species in the Scotia Sea. Such details contribute towards resolving how pelagic food webs are structured in the Southern Ocean and their sensitivity to ongoing environmental change.

A sum greater than its parts: merging multi-predator tracking studies to increase ecological understanding	ECOSPHERE												Understanding how animals find prey in heterogeneous environments is a central goal of ecology. Placing this process in an environmental context requires a lot of information regarding the characteristics of both the habitat selected by the animal and its surroundings. In high-latitude marine systems, information about subsurface habitats of marine predators is often very limited. Animal-borne oceanographic instruments have added a new modality to improve our understanding of marine predators and their habitats. While these instruments do not collect environmental information beyond that experienced by the animals carrying them, our study makes use of an oceanographic dataset collected by southern elephant seals (Mirounga leonina; N = 15), to provide environmental context for two sympatrically foraging penguin species in the waters close to the subantarctic island of Bouvetoya. The seals collected 154 CTD profiles during the study period, averaging 4.9 (+/- 3.67) profiles per day, documenting the stratification of the upper water layer in terms of both seawater density and temperature. Using these data, we quantitatively describe the relationship between the diving behavior of the penguins (N = 3,745 dives) and the hydrographic properties of the three-dimensional area in which they were foraging. Both penguin species appeared to favor water characterized by a shallow mixed layer. The chinstrap penguins (Pygoscelis antarctica) dove within a shallow, unstable body of water close to the colony, whereas macaroni penguins (Eudyptes chrysolophus) exploited the bottom of the surface mixed layer further offshore. The hydrographic properties preferred by the penguins match closely those that describe the highest densities of their preferred prey, krill (Euphausia superba), identified during a temporally and spatially concurrent study. We demonstrate how merging multiple telemetric data streams from animals can shed new light on aspects of foraging behavior beyond simply relating movements to two-dimensional, remotely sensed measurements of the environment.

J	Grilli, MG; Libertelli, M; Montalti, D				Grana Grilli, Maricel; Libertelli, Marcela; Montalti, Diego			Diet of South Polar Skua Chicks in Two Areas of Sympatry with Brown Skua	WATERBIRDS												The food provided to South Polar Skuas (Stercorarius maccormicki) chicks was determined at two Antarctic sites where South Polar Skuas breed sympatrically with Brown Skuas (S. antarcticus). At Harmony Point on Nelson Island, 16 samples of regurgitated stomach contents were analyzed, all contained remains of penguin chicks (mostly soft tissues), which constituted the bulk of the contents, while only two samples had fish or krill remains. These South Polar Skuas had access to penguin colonies, where they hunted chicks or fed on fresh carcasses. However, at Half Moon Island, only two out of nine samples contained minor amounts of penguin remains while fish were the major dietary resource. The high fish content in their diet may indicate a preference for marine rather than terrestrial resources or be the result of competition with Brown Skuas. The variability in food items evidenced by the differences in regurgitated stomach contents indicates that South Polar Skuas may have a trophic plasticity that allows them to change their feeding habits from one resource to another one according to availability. Such may make them less vulnerable to a reduction in the availability of a particular food item. Received 11 March 2011, accepted 27 August 2011.

Short moan call reveals seasonal occurrence and diel-calling pattern of crabeater seals in the Weddell Sea, Antarctica	BIOACOUSTICS-THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ANIMAL SOUND AND ITS RECORDING												Crabeater seals (Lobodon carcinophaga) are an important component of the Southern Ocean as they are the most abundant pinniped species in this krill-based ecosystem; however, their acoustic repertoire and ecology remain to be fully described. Seasonal occurrence and diel-calling pattern of crabeater seal off the Maud Rise, eastern Weddell Sea, are described using passive acoustic monitoring data collected over 8 months (mid-January to mid-September) in 2014. We describe a new call type of crabeater seals, the short moan call (mean 90% duration: 2.2 +/- 0.3 (SD) s, peak frequency: 596.5 +/- 109.4 Hz, and frequency range: 122-1024 Hz), which was the only detected call type and 1871 calls were enumerated. Those crabeater seal calls were detected from April until mid-September (with peak in calling around September), which coincided with the appearance of sea ice. Short moan call rates were highest at night in August (i.e., 6.4 calls per minute) and September, and showed no diel variations for April through July. Distance to the sea ice edge and month of the year were the most important predictors of call occurrence and call rates of crabeater seals. This study highlights the Maud Rise as a useful habitat for this species.

J	ULLRICH, B; STORCH, V				ULLRICH, B; STORCH, V			DEVELOPMENT OF THE STOMACH IN EUPHAUSIA-SUPERBA DANA (EUPHAUSIACEA)	JOURNAL OF CRUSTACEAN BIOLOGY												Development of the stomach, with emphasis on the filter system, was investigated in the metanauplius, calyptopis, and furcilia stages of the Antarctic krill Euphausia superba. The metanauplius lacks an elaborated stomach as well as a connection between the esophagus and the midgut. In calyptopis I, the stomach becomes functional. The armature of the cardiac stomach consists of basic components such as lateral and ventral projections and stout spines, but not a primary filter. The latter develops before molt beneath the cuticle and is seen in the exuvial space of calyptopis II. With molting to calyptopis III, the primary filter is elaborated and becomes capable of sorting food particles and of separating a dorsal food from a ventral filtration channel. Although in furcilia IV the spacing of spines in the primary filter is nearly identical to that in the adult specimens, the filter spines in calyptopis III are more widely separated. In all larval stages examined (except furcilia IV), the development of the pyloric stomach is delayed with respect to that of the cardiac stomach. Residues of a pyloric secondary filter system were not found in developing stages of Euphausia superba.																	0278-0372					AUG	1993	13	3					423	431		10.2307/1548785							WOS:A1993LT33600003

New satellite tracks detail humpback whale migration pathways from Western Australia into the Southern Ocean. These highlight a focal feeding area during austral spring and early summer at the southern Kerguelen plateau, in a western boundary current where a sharp northward turn and retroflection of ocean fronts occurs along the eastern plateau edge. The topographic steering of oceanographic features here likely supports a predictable, productive and persistent forage ground. The spatial distribution of whaling catches and Discovery era mark-recaptures confirms the importance of this region to Western Australian humpback whales since at least historical times. Movement modelling discriminates sex-related behaviours, with females moving faster during both transit and resident periods, which may be a consequence of size or indicate differential energetic requirements. Relatively short and directed migratory pathways overall, together with high-quality, reliable forage resources may provide a partial explanation for the ongoing strong recovery demonstrated by this population. The combination of new oceanographic information and movement data provides enhanced understanding of important biological processes, which are relevant within the context of the current spatial management and conservation efforts in the Southern Ocean.

Density and distribution of euphausiid larvae in the Scotia Sea in the 2011 summer	POLAR BIOLOGY												Monitoring of early euphausiid larvae provides valuable information on the mechanisms involved in recruitment to the adult populations. As the Antarctic is undergoing rapid environmental change, these mechanisms are key to ecosystem-based management of the krill fishery. We analyzed the distribution and abundance of early euphausiid larvae (calyptopes I to late furciliae) from 76 plankton samples from surface to 300 m depth in the Atlantic sector in January 2011 in relation with a previous survey and published information. Thysanoessa macrura (mean density: 209 ind m(-2)) dominated the sampling while Euphausia superba (mean density: 13.63 ind m(-2)) and Euphausia frigida (mean density: 10.05 ind m(-2)) were also present. T. macrura density increased while E. superba experienced a high decrease respect to historical data. Clustering of stations and correspondence analysis showed that the associations of larvae and water masses are in agreement with literature reports, so the differences on the abundance of early larvae are within the observed variability and cannot be attributed to any single factor, suggesting that it is due to more subtle changes such as the stability of the water column and/or vorticity in the fronts.

ENZYME REGULATION OF SELECTED CRUSTACEANS WITH REGARD TO TEMPERATURE ADAPTATION	JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE PHYSIOLOGY B-BIOCHEMICAL SYSTEMIC AND ENVIRONMENTAL PHYSIOLOGY												The characteristics and properties of chromatographically purified citrate synthase from the euphausiids Euphausia superba (Antarctica) and Meganyctiphanes norvegica (Scandinavian Kattegat and Mediterranean Sea) and from the isopods Serolis polita (Antarctica) and Idotea baltica (Baltic Sea) were used to elucidate biochemical mechanisms of temperature adaptation. Additionally, maintenance experiments were carried out on the euphausiids to determine mechanisms of short term acclimation. Temperature optima (between 37 and 45 degrees C) were unrelated to genotypic cold adaptation, but the activation energy of the Antarctic krill E. superba (10.9 kJ . mol(-1)) was only a quarter of that in other species (41.8-45.1 kJ . mol(-1)). The minima of apparent Michaelis constants (total range: 4-20 mu mol . l(-1) oxaloacetate: 7-45 mu mol . l(-1) acetyl-coenzyme A) showed no relation to natural conditions, and no distinct pH optimum occurred at ambient temperatures. In contrast. apparent Michaelis constants and specific enzyme activities were related to maintenance temperatures in M. norvegica but not in E. superba. The differences between M. norvegica and E. superba can be interpreted as adaptations to the changes in ambient temperature with regard to the respective steno- and eurythermic tolerances of these crustaceans.																	0174-1578	1432-136X				APR	1995	165	1					46	55		10.1007/BF00264685							WOS:A1995QX90900006

Meso- and macro-zooplankton community structure of the Amundsen Sea Polynya, Antarctica (Summer 2010-2011)	ELEMENTA-SCIENCE OF THE ANTHROPOCENE												The Amundsen Sea Polynya (ASP) has, on average, the highest productivity per unit area in Antarctic waters. To investigate community structure and the role that zooplankton may play in utilizing this productivity, animals were collected at six stations inside and outside the ASP using paired "day-night" tows with a 1 m(2) MOCNESS. Stations were selected according to productivity based on satellite imagery, distance from the ice edge, and depth of the water column. Depths sampled were stratified from the surface to similar to 50-100 m above the seafloor. Macrozooplankton were also collected at four stations located in different parts of the ASP using a 2 m2 Metro Net for krill surface trawls (0-120 m). The most abundant groups of zooplankton were copepods, ostracods, and euphausiids. Zooplankton biovolume (0.001 to 1.22 ml m(-3)) and abundance (0.21 to 97.5 individuals m(-3)) varied throughout all depth levels, with a midsurface maximum trend at similar to 60-100 m. A segregation of increasing zooplankton trophic position with depth was observed in the MOCNESS tows. In general, zooplankton abundance was low above the mixed layer depth, a result attributed to a thick layer of the unpalatable colonial haptophyte, Phaeocystis antarctica. Abundances of the ice krill, Euphausia crystallarophias, however, were highest near the edge of the ice sheet within the ASP and larvae: adult ratios correlated with temperature above a depth of 60 m. Total zooplankton abundance correlated positively with chlorophyll a above 150 m, but negative correlations observed for biovolume vs. the proportion of P. antarctica in the phyto-plankton estimated from pigment ratios (19'hexanoyloxyfucoxanthin: fucoxanthin) again pointed to avoidance of P. antarctica. Quantifying zooplankton community structure, abundance, and biovolume (biomass) in this highly productive polynya helps shed light on how carbon may be transferred to higher trophic levels and to depth in a region undergoing rapid warming.

Swimbladder morphology masks Southern Ocean mesopelagic fish biomass	PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES												Within the twilight of the oceanic mesopelagic realm, 200-1000 m below sea level, are potentially vast resources of fish. Collectively, these mesopelagic fishes are the most abundant vertebrates on Earth, and this global fish community plays a vital role in the function of oceanic ecosystems. The biomass of these fishes has recently been estimated using acoustic survey methods, which rely on echosounder-generated signals being reflected from gas-filled swimbladders and detected by transducers on vessels. Here, we use X-ray computed tomography scans to demonstrate that several of the most abundant species of mesopelagic fish in the Southern Ocean lack gas-filled swimbladders. We also show using catch data from survey trawls that the fish community switches from fish possessing gas-filled swimbladders to those lacking swimbladders as latitude increases towards the Antarctic continent. Thus, the acoustic surveys that repeatedly show a decrease in mesopelagic fish biomass towards polar environments systematically overlook a large proportion of fish species that dominate polar seas. Importantly, this includes lanternfish species that are key prey items for top predators in the region, including king penguins and elephant seals. This latitudinal community switch, from gas to non-gas dominance, has considerable implications for acoustic biomass estimation, ecosystem modelling and long-term monitoring of species at risk from climate change and potential exploitation.

J	Greely, TM; Gartner, JV; Torres, JJ				Greely, TM; Gartner, JV; Torres, JJ			Age and growth of Electrona antarctica (Pisces : Myctophidae), the dominant mesopelagic fish of the Southern Ocean	MARINE BIOLOGY												Numerically and in biomass, the lanternfish Electrona antarctica is the dominant fish in the vast pelagic region of the Southern Ocean bounded on the north by the Antarctic Convergence and in the south by the Antarctic continental shelf. It is an important krill predator, and in turn is important in the diets of flighted and swimming seabirds. Further, it is the southernmost and coldest-dwelling representative of the globally distributed fish family Myctophidae. The present study was undertaken to estimate the species' growth rate and average life span, to incorporate the information in a basic energy budget, and to compare the growth of E. antarctica with more northerly confamilials. Fishes were aged using primary growth increments that were resolved on sagittal otoliths using three sequential techniques: thin-section grinding and polishing, etching, and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Based on. increment width (0.8 to 1.2 mu m), continuity, and previous studies on confamilials, the microincrements were assumed to be deposited on a daily basis. Montages of SEM photomicrographs were constructed for each sagitta to allow the daily rings to be counted over the entire life span of 31 individuals representing the entire size range of the species. Results suggest a larval stage of 30 to 47 d and a maximum life span of 3.5 yr, with females growing faster than males in the last 1.5 yr of life and reaching a larger maximum size. Construction of a simple energy budget using the best information available suggests that a surplus of energy is available to support the observed growth rates (0.05 to 0.07 mm d(-1)). The results of the present study contrast markedly with previous estimates of an 8 to 11 yr maximum age for E. antarctica. These results provide important data addressing the ecology and population dynamics of the pelagic Antarctic ecosystem. E. antarctica is the end-member species in the continuum of vertically migrating myctophids that extend from the equator to the polar circle. Its growth rate is consonant with that of all other myctophid species examined using primary growth increments to determine age. The present study, in conjunction with earlier studies, suggests that growth rates of mesopelagic species are far higher than previously thought.																	0025-3162					JAN	1999	133	1					145	158		10.1007/s002270050453							WOS:000078634000018

A central mechanism hypothesised to underlie the CTMAX of water-breathing ectotherms is insufficient tissue oxygen supply for vital maintenance functions because of a temperature-induced collapse of the cardiorespiratory system. The CTMAX of species conforming to this hypothesis should decrease with declining water oxygen tension (PO2) because they have oxygen-dependent upper thermal limits. However, recent studies have identified a number of fishes and crustaceans with oxygen-independent upper thermal limits, their CTMAX unchanged in progressive aquatic hypoxia. The previous studies, which were performed separately on cold-water, temperate and tropical species, suggest the oxygen-dependence of upper thermal limits and the acute thermal sensitivity of the cardiorespiratory system increases with decreasing habitat temperature. Here we directly test this hypothesis by assessing the oxygen-dependence of CTMAX in the polar Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba), as well as the temperate Baltic prawn (Palaemon adspersus) and brown shrimp (Crangon crangon). We found that P. adspersus and C. crangon maintain CTMAX in progressive hypoxia down to 40 mmHg, and that only E. superba have oxygen-dependent upper thermal limits at normoxia. In E. superba, the observed decline in CTMAX with water PO2 is further supported by heart-rate measurements showing a plateauing, and subsequent decline and collapse of heart performance at CTMAX. Our results support the hypothesis that the oxygen-dependence of upper thermal limits in water-breathing ectotherms and the acute thermal sensitivity of their cardiorespiratory system increases with decreasing habitat temperature.

The majority of the 57 species did not vertically migrate and lived deeper during the winter than during the spring or fall. However, despite the short day length, several of the most common mesopelagic fish and crustaceans did migrate. Fish moved into shallower depths at night but apparently most did not continue into the near-freezing upper mixed layer, leaving that zone to the migratory crustaceans. In the upper 1000 m, the dominant species were, in order of decreasing biomass, Euphausia superba, the cnidarian Atolla wyvillei, the ctenophore Beroe sp., and the mesopelagic fish Electrona antarctica, Bathylagus antarcticus and Gymnoscopelus braueri. Thysanoessa macrura and Salpa thompsoni were biomass subdominants. The majority of the dominant species showed little seasonal differences in biomass. However, the biomass of gelatinous species varied considerably with A. wyvillei and Beroe sp. being most abundant and S. thompsoni least abundant during the winter. Incidence of food in the stomachs in several important species was low, suggesting a low impact on their zooplankton prey. Specimens of S. thompsoni had high quantities of food in their guts but this species was uncommon so its net impact would also have been low. Euphausia superba and the three common mesopelagic fish had significantly lower stomach fullness ratings during the winter than during the fall, suggesting an overall decrease in feeding activity of dominant species during the winter.																	0722-4060					JUN	1991	11	3					157	167									WOS:A1991FU68700002						
J	Cherel, Y; Hobson, KA; Weimerskirch, H				Cherel, Y; Hobson, KA; Weimerskirch, H			Using stable isotopes to study resource acquisition and allocation in procellariiform seabirds	OECOLOGIA												Some procellariiform seabirds use a dual strategy for provisioning their chicks by alternating short (ST) and long (LT) foraging trips. Parent birds gain mass during LT but they lose mass while increasing the chick feeding frequency during ST. Self-feeding during LT is crucial for the success of ST because firstly most of the energy used during ST is likely to be derived from the energy stored during LT and secondly self-feeding during ST is presumed to be negligible. Self-feeding by adult procellariiforms is thus a key issue to understand allocation processes but it is still poorly known. We tested these predictions by using the stable isotope (delta N-15 and delta C-13) technique on birds' plasma and prey with the short-tailed shearwater Puffinus tenuirostris breeding at Tasmania as a model. Parent shearwaters returning to the colony after a LT have an Antarctic/subantarctic delta C-13 signature in their plasma (-23.8%), thus indicating that they fed in cold waters, far away from their breeding colony, for their own maintenance. Parent birds returning to the colony after a ST also have a distant Antarctic/subantarctic delta C-13 signature in their plasma (-24.3%), thus verifying that self-feeding is negligible during ST and that birds fast at that time, using energy stores built up in cold waters. Plasma delta N-15 values of adults (8.8%) indicates they mainly prey upon zooplankton-eating organisms, probably mesopelagic myctophid fishes. A simple isotopic mixing model estimates that they consume by mass 87% myctophids and 13% subantarctic krill when self-feeding. Finally and as expected, the carbon isotopic signature of chick plasma (-22.2%) was intermediate between those of high- and low-latitude marine organisms and is thus in agreement with chicks being fed with a large diversity of prey species caught by adult birds from Antarctic to Tasmanian waters. One main consequence of this system is that reproduction of a Tasmanian species is controlled by resources available at great distances from the breeding colony that drive allocation decisions of parent birds.

It inhabits the intestine of Gondogeneia sp., a benthic amphipod found along the shore of James Ross Island, Weddell Sea, Antarctica. The prevalence of the infection was very low and only a few caudo-frontal syzygies were found. Morphologically, the new species is close to a previously described amphipod gregarine, Ganymedes themistos, albeit with several dissimilarities in the structure of the contact zone between syzygy partners, as well as other characteristics. Phylogenetic analysis of the 18S rDNA from G. yurii supported a close relationship between these species. These two species were grouped with other gregarines isolated from crustaceans hosts (Cephaloidophoroidea); however, statistical support throughout the clade of Cephaloidophoroidea gregarines was minimal using the available dataset.

Behavioural responses of blue petrel chicks (Halobaena caerulea) to food-related and novel odours in a simple wind tunnel	ANTARCTIC SCIENCE												As a first step towards understanding the development of olfactory behaviours in Antarctic procellariiform seabirds, we recently showed that blue petrel chicks (Halobaena caerulea) could detect both a food-related and a novel odour while asleep. In this current study, we tested chicks in a simple wind tunnel to determine if exploratory behaviours could be initiated by olfactory stimuli as well. We compared the behavioural responses of 30 blue petrel chicks to cod liver oil (a prey-related odour) or phenyl ethyl alcohol (an unfamiliar, rosy-smelling odourant) against a control (distilled water). Six behavioural indices were measured, including head turns, body turns, bites, preening events, wing-stretches, and distance walked. In response to cod liver oil, we found that chicks increased both turning rates and distances walked whereas chicks preened more in response to phenyl ethyl alcohol. Since only cod liver oil initiated behaviours consistent with searching, our results suggest that chicks are attaching biological significance to food-related odours even before they leave the burrow to forage for the first time.

Exploration of their physical and biological forcing functions during summer 2000	JOURNAL OF PLANKTON RESEARCH												A survey of the biological and physical oceanography of the Ligurian Sea was conducted in the late summer of 2000. Forty-one stations were sampled for nutrients, oxygen, fluorescence and hydrographic information. Acoustic backscatter measurements were used to estimate abundance of small (<5 mm) zooplankton biovolume versus depth and the distribution of northern krill, Meganyctiphanes norvegica. Net-tow and underwater video data were collected to identify the zooplankton present. These data were used to analyze the Ligurian Sea ecogsystem for physical and biological linkages that control zooplankton abundance and distribution. Results are compared with those from a similar study conducted in 1999. Hydrogrophic sampling showed a dome of dense water in the southwestern middle of the basin. The highest chlorophyll a (Chl a) concentrations were measured in this area, while small zooplankton biovolume was evenly distributed throughout the survey. Integrated values of Chl a and small zooplankton biovolume in 2000 were greater than in 1999. Meganyctiphanes norvegica, siphomphores and salps were the dominant components Of the macrozooplankton population in the upper 200 in. In the sampled depth strata, siphonophore abundance did not change during the day, while M. norvegica were only caught at night.

Mesozooplankton Community Composition Controls Fecal Pellet Flux and Remineralization Depth in the Southern Ocean	FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE												Zooplankton fecal pellets (FPs) are important conduits of carbon from the surface to the deep ocean, as shown by their presence in deep-sea sediment traps. Zooplankton themselves are thought to play an important role in the breakdown and reworking of FPs as they sink, whilst processes such as diel vertical migration (DVM) may enhance the supply of carbon to the mesopelagic. However, comparatively little is known about the processes or variability of FP sinking/transport within the upper mesopelagic and how this relates to deeper ocean export. Profiles of FP type and size, and the contribution made by FPs to mesopelagic carbon flux to a depth of 400 m, were considered. Three contrasting locations in the Scotia Sea were compared, which together reflect the variability in physical regime and productivity encountered across the Southern Ocean. Comparing observed FPs with predictions from the mesozooplankton community, we show that, even at shallow depths, the smallest fraction of FP is under-represented, suggesting rapid remineralization, incorporation into larger aggregates or reworking into larger FPs, and that the flux is dominated by FPs from larger zooplankton. In contrast to models where POC attenuation rates are set to increase with temperature, we find that FP carbon flux attenuates rapidly in low productivity, colder regions dominated by krill, while remineralization is deeper in warmer areas where productivity is high and copepods dominate. This emphasizes the strong modulation of the zooplankton community on the supply and transfer of FP carbon between the epi-and mesopelagic. Evidence was found to suggest that DVM enhances FP flux across the upper mesopelagic, producing a pulse of fresh, dense material that may support secondary production and heterotrophic respiration in the mesopelagic. This illustrates that variability in flux at short (daily) as well as longer (seasonal) timescales may have important implications for the supply of FP carbon to deeper waters.

Objectives were (1) to investigate the adult diet when they feed for themselves by analyzing stomach oil lipids, and (2) to compare the lipid signature of chick and adult oils. Stomach oils mainly consisted of triacylglycerols (TAG), diacylglycerol-ethers (DAGE) and wax esters (WE) (66, 14 and 11%, respectively). The dietary origin of TAG and WE was evaluated by linear discriminant analyses with fatty acid and fatty alcohol fractions. Analyses evidenced that stomach oils did not originate from Antarctic krill, but instead from myctophid fish, thus demonstrating the importance of mesopelagic fish in the nutrition of adult petrels. This result was consistent with the identification of digested remains of myctophids recovered from adult stomach contents after long foraging trips. Large amounts of a rare lipid class, DAGE (up to 76% of total lipids), were identified in two stomach oils, together with fresh remains of the squid Gonatus antarcticus (99% by mass), suggesting that DAGE could have the potential to be trophic markers of cephalopods. Moreover, six oils probably originated from Patagonian toothfish, thus confirming strong interactions between white-chinned petrels and fisheries. Comparison between chick and adult stomach oils indicated no major differences in their biochemical composition suggesting an identical dietary origin of oils, mainly myctophids. Both adult and chick oils can therefore be used to determine the feeding ecology of adult birds when they feed far away from their breeding grounds. Finally, food analysis of chick samples and adult samples collected after short and long trips indicated different foraging grounds during the two kinds of trips, and also between long trips performed in subtropical and Antarctic waters.

Both species showed distinct differences in the amount of total lipids (TLs), lipid class and fatty acid (FA) compositions as well as proteolytic enzyme activities. In M. norvegica, the overall amount of TLs and storage lipids was much lower than in H. glacialis, and triacylglycerols formed the major lipid fraction with a mean of 48% TLs. Major FAs comprised the trophic markers 20:1(n-9) and 22:1(n-11), indicating the ingestion of calanid copepods. Additionally, the FAs 22:6(n-3), 18:1(n-9) and 16:0 prevailed. In H. glacialis, TLs (mean = 44% dry mass) were about twice as high as in krill, with wax esters comprising up to 89% TLs. H. glacialis seems to accumulate these lipids as energy reserves to survive periods of food limitation. Moreover, high lipid levels, particularly wax esters, also help to maintain neutral buoyancy. The major FA in H. glacialis was 18:1(n-9); other dominant FAs were 20:1(n-9) and 22:1(n-11), typical of calanid copepods, as well as the diatom trophic marker 16:1(n-7). Both species showed omnivorous feeding behaviour with a strong tendency towards carnivory. Total proteolytic activities in midgut gland tissue were higher in M. norvegica than in H. glacialis. In M. norvegica, proteinases were dominated by serine proteinases, whereas cysteine proteinases formed the major group in H. glacialis. High proteolytic activity in M. norvegica indicates a high digestive potential for proteins and efficient utilization of prey. The presence of different proteinase classes in both species may be due to different group-specific enzyme expression patterns between euphausiids and caridean decapods. Both species follow highly deviating life strategies, as reflected by their specific lipid and enzymatic characteristics.

Importance of ice algal production for top predators: new insights using sea-ice biomarkers	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												Antarctic seals and seabirds are strongly dependent on sea-ice cover to complete their life history. In polar ecosystems, sea ice provides a habitat for ice-associated diatoms that ensures a substantial production of organic matter. Recent studies have presented the potential of highly branched isoprenoids (HBIs) for tracing carbon flows from ice algae to higher-trophic-level organisms. However, to our knowledge, this new method has never been applied to sub-Antarctic species and Antarctic seals. Moreover, seasonal variations in HBI levels have never been investigated in Antarctic predators, despite a likely shift in food source from ice-derived to pelagic organic matter after sea-ice retreat. In the present study, we described HBI levels in a community of seabirds and seals breeding in Adelie Land, Antarctica. We then validated that sub-Antarctic seabirds had lower levels of diene, a HBI of sea-ice diatom origin, and higher levels of triene, a HBI of phytoplanktonic origin, compared with Antarctic seabirds. Finally, we explored temporal changes in HBI levels after the ice break up in summer. The level of diene relative to triene in Adelie penguin chicks increased and then declined during the breeding season, which was consistent with the short and intense proliferation of sea-ice algae in spring, followed by the pelagic phytoplankton bloom in summer. HBI biomarkers in Antarctic seabirds and seals thus indicate a shift from ice-algal derived organic matter to a pelagic carbon source during the summer breeding season.

Weddell Sea Export Pathways from Surface Drifters	JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL OCEANOGRAPHY												The complex export pathways that connect the surface waters of the Weddell Sea with the Antarctic Circumpolar Current influence water mass modification, nutrient fluxes, and ecosystem dynamics. To study this exchange, 40 surface drifters, equipped with temperature sensors, were released into the northwestern Weddell Sea's continental shelf and slope frontal systemin late January 2012. Comparison of the drifter trajectories with a similar deployment in early February 2007 provides insight into the interannual variability of the surface circulation in this region. Observed differences in the 2007 and 2012 drifter trajectories are related to a variable surface circulation responding to changes in wind stress curl over the Weddell Gyre. Differences between northwestern Weddell Sea properties in 2007 and 2012 include 1) an enhanced cyclonic wind stress forcing over the Weddell Gyre in 2012; 2) an acceleration of the Antarctic Slope Current (ASC) and an offshore shift of the primary drifter export pathway in 2012; and 3) a strengthening of the Coastal Current (CC) over the continental shelf in 2007. The relationship between wind stress forcing and surface circulation is reproduced over a longer time period in virtual drifter deployments advected by a remotely sensed surface velocity product. The mean offshore position and speed of the drifter trajectories are correlated with the wind stress curl over the Weddell Gyre, although with different temporal lags. The drifter observations are consistent with recent modeling studies suggesting that Weddell Sea boundary current variability can significantly impact the rate and source of exported surface waters to the Scotia Sea, a process that determines regional chlorophyll distributions.

The measurement system consists of a 70 kHz split-beam system and a video camera system to observe the orientation of animals. The transducer was set pointing downward on the top of the small tank with a window on one of the side walls for observing orientation. TS measurement and orientation observation are performed simultaneously. This system can avoid external disturbances such as wind and waves and be set up easily for measurements including measurement on board a ship. TS measurement for a physical model (copper cylinder) was conducted and the measured TS was in good agreement with the theoretical result, showing the accuracy of our method. Next, TS measurements of live shrimps were conducted to get detailed TS patterns. We compared the measured results with the theoretical TS patterns and confirmed a reasonable agreement.

J	SCHOENHERR, JR				SCHOENHERR, JR			BLUE WHALES FEEDING ON HIGH-CONCENTRATIONS OF EUPHAUSIIDS AROUND MONTEREY SUBMARINE-CANYON	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY-REVUE CANADIENNE DE ZOOLOGIE												An unusually high concentration of blue whales,Balaenoptera musculus, fed on euphausiids that were concentrated in deep scattering layers and daytime surface swams in Monterey Bay, California, during the fall of 1986. Blue whales were closely associated with deep scattering layers that were elongated along the southeast edge of the Monterey Submarine Canyon throughout most of November 1986. These scattering layers contained euphausiids, primarily Thysanoessa spinifera, which accounted for 45.4% of the total biomass of zooplankton tows taken through deep scattering layers. Tows taken above or outside the layers consisted of only 4.0% euphausiids. The greatest concentrations of blue whales were observed in areas of thick scattering layers that contained high krill biomass. In addition, surface-lunging blue whales fed on daytime surface swarms of Thysanoessa spinifera near the head of Monterey Submarine Canyon on 11 and 12 November 1986. Surface tows taken in whale feeding areas were dominated by T. spinifera, which accounted for 64.4% of the total zooplankton biomass, while surface tows taken outside whale areas consisted of only 0.3% euphausiids. Euphausiid densities in surface swarms were slightly higher and more variable than in deep layers. Thysanoessa spinifera size frequency distributions showed that surface swarms may be similar to the deep layer in some areas, but they may contain larger, sexually mature individuals in other areas. Blue whale fecal samples confirmed that the whales were feeding on euphausiids. The disappearance of the blue whales from Monterey Bay was accompanied by a decline in krill biomass along the southeast edge of the submarine canyon. This coincided with the cessation of a prolonged upwelling period that persisted in Monterey Bay throughout November 1986.																	0008-4301					MAR	1991	69	3					583	594		10.1139/z91-088							WOS:A1991FJ47300008

MARINE BIOLOGY												Ophiurid basket stars belonging to the family Gorgonocephalidae are distributed from the Arctic to the Antarctic and from the shallow subtidal to the deep sea, but their biology remains poorly known. In situ observations at the mouth of the Oslofjord by a remotely operated vehicle showed that Gorgonocephalus caputmedusae had a patchy distribution at 85 to 120 m water depth and frequently occurred in association with the gorgonian Paramuricea placomus and the coral Lophelia pertusa. Morphological and histological studies show that G. caputmedusae is well adapted to capture macroplanktonic prey. Histological examination of the arms revealed the presence of a thick layer of dermal mutable connective tissue which is probably an energy-efficient way to maintain its feeding posture against the current. This layer is connected to the nerve cord suggesting that the passive mechanical properties (stiffness) is controlled by the nervous system. In the distal parts of the arms, each segment has a pair of sticky tube feet and a sophisticated system of spines and hooks, which are connected to muscles and collagenous tendons. In combination, these features were shown, in an experimental flume study, to be used for capturing the locally abundant krill species Meganyctiphanes norvegica. This is the first documentation of G. caputmedusae of this kind.

Relationships between isotopic values and oxidative status: insights from populations of gentoo penguins	OECOLOGIA												Feeding strategies can affect the balance between the production of reactive oxygen species and antioxidant defences (i.e. oxidative status). This is ecologically relevant, as variation in oxidative status can in turn strongly affect fitness. However, how animals regulate their oxidative status through their feeding behaviour under natural conditions remains poorly understood. Thus, relating the isotopic values of free-ranging animals to their oxidative status may prove useful. Here, we considered three colonies of gentoo penguins (Pygoscelis papua) in which we measured (1) delta C-13 and delta N-15 values, and (2) antioxidant defences and oxidative damage. We found that colonies with the highest delta C-13 and delta N-15 values also had the highest levels of antioxidant defences and oxidative damage, resulting in positive relationships between isotopic values and markers of oxidative status. As a result, colony segregation in terms of isotopic values was reflected by segregation in terms of oxidative markers (although more markedly for oxidative damage than for antioxidant defences). Interestingly, variation in the estimated contribution of krill in the diet of penguins followed an opposite pattern to that observed for markers of oxidative status, providing evidence that inter-population differences in terms of foraging strategies can result in inter-population differences in terms of oxidative status. More studies examining simultaneously oxidative status, isotopic signature, foraging behaviour and food allocation between parents and young are, however, needed to understand better the interplay between the foraging strategies adopted by animals in their natural habitat and their oxidative status.

However, it remains unknown whether juveniles exhibit similar foraging behavior during their early life at-sea movements, and how it links with the oceanographic conditions. We investigated the first at-sea odyssey of 15 juvenile emperor penguins from Terre Adelie in 2013-2014. The average tracking duration was 167 +/- 110 d SD (range 86-344 d). After departing the colony in December/January, the juveniles traveled north up to 53.76 degrees S before heading south in April/May to forage within the sea ice. The juveniles spent 49 +/- 14 % of their total recorded trips (n = 12) in the sea ice, over both the continental slope and deep ocean regions. The penguins dived primarily during daylight. Within sea ice, the juveniles performed both shallow and deep dives, with the proportion of each varying seasonally. The switch to primarily deep dives in the autumn and winter within sea ice may be a consequence of (1) a seasonal change in the krill distribution from surface to deep waters and/or (2) the presence of macrozooplankton at depth due to a reduced/absent diel migration. Furthermore, we showed for the first time that the diving behavior of juveniles was associated with the mixed layer depth. We suggest they feed on mesopelagic prey aggregating near the thermocline. This study provides insight into an important, but poorly understood, part of the emperor penguin life cycle, essential to predict their response to future climate change.

However, restricting fishing access on the high seas raises many concerns, including how such restrictions would affect food security. We analyze high seas catches and trade data to determine the contribution of the high seas catch to global seafood production, the main species caught on the high seas, and the primary markets where these species are sold. By volume, the total catch from the high seas accounts for 4.2% of annual marine capture fisheries production and 2.4% of total seafood production, including freshwater fisheries and aquaculture. Thirty-nine fish and invertebrate species account for 99.5% of the high seas targeted catch, but only one species, Antarctic toothfish, is caught exclusively on the high seas. The remaining catch, which is caught both on the high seas and in national jurisdictions, is made up primarily of tunas, billfishes, small pelagic fishes, pelagic squids, toothfish, and krill. Most high seas species are destined for upscale food and supplement markets in developed, food-secure countries, such as Japan, the European Union, and the United States, suggesting that, in aggregate, high seas fisheries play a negligible role in ensuring global food security.

J	Wilson, RP				Wilson, Rory P.			Resource partitioning and niche hyper-volume overlap in free-living Pygoscelid penguins	FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY												P>1. Species potentially competing for the same resource are considered to be able to co-exist if they occupy different niches. In an apparent example of this, Adelie, Chinstrap and Gentoo penguins all feed predominantly on krill Euphausea superba at certain sites of sympatry in Antarctica and are proposed to exploit different niche hyper-volumes via differential area and depth utilization. 2. Patterns of foraging for 49 of these penguins breeding in sympatry were assessed using dead-reckoning loggers to examine foraging niche overlap. 3. Area use overlaps were 0 center dot 29 for Adelie boolean AND Chinstrap, 0 center dot 44 for Adelie boolean AND Gentoo, and 0 center dot 40 for Chinstrap boolean AND Adelie and depth use overlaps were 0 center dot 69 for Adelie boolean AND Chinstrap, 0 center dot 48 for Adelie boolean AND Gentoo, and 0 center dot 52 for Chinstrap boolean AND Gentoo Penguins. 4. Foraging efficiency was greatest for Adelie Penguins diving near surface waters (0-15 m) while Chinstraps were most efficient at medium depths (15-60 m) and Gentoo Penguins most efficient at deeper depths (> 60 m). There appear to be physiological reasons for this. Penguins primarily exploited those depths where they were most efficient. 5. The overlap for foraging periods was 0 center dot 47 for Adelie boolean AND Chinstrap, 0 center dot 26 for Adelie boolean AND Gentoo, and 0 center dot 40 for Chinstrap boolean AND Gentoo Penguins. Chinstraps foraged primarily at night, Gentoos during the morning and Adelies in the afternoon. Temporal differences in foraging may result in the three species exploiting krill at those depths where it is best adapted to pursue it, this being mediated by the diel vertical migration of krill. 6. Integration of all measured parameters together gives minimal overlap between species with total overlaps of 0 center dot 09 for Adelie boolean AND Chinstrap, 0 center dot 05 for Adelie boolean AND Gentoo, and 0 center dot 08 for Chinstrap boolean AND Gentoo Penguins so it appears that these penguins conform to conventional theory in avoiding competition in areas of sympatry. However, a model incorporating prey movement between hyper-volumes indicates that penguins may still compete, even in the virtual absence of hyper-volume overlap. 7. This study shows that Pygoscelid penguin do indeed exploit different hypervolumes in areas of sympatry but that such exploitation of different niches by sympatric species feeding on a common resource does not necessarily result in reduced competition if the mobility of prey is high.																	0269-8463	1365-2435				JUN	2010	24	3					646	657		10.1111/j.1365-2435.2009.01654.x							WOS:000276508000017

Sea ice coverage during the previous winter exhibited a gradual decline in northwards extent from 80 degrees E, where its edge was located at 57 degrees S, to 150 degrees E, where it reached 62-63 degrees S, Productivity versus irradiance (P-l) experiments were conducted to calculate primary productivity, and measurements of the photochemical quantum efficiency of photosynthesis (F-nu F,IF,) were made using a fast repetition rate (FRR) fluorometer. Phytoplankton pigment (HPLC) and nutrient (nitrate, phosphate and silicate) concentrations also were obtained. Mean chlorophyll a concentrations in the mixed layer were highest ( > 1 1 mu g 1-(1)) on the continental shelf along 93,5 degrees E and in the shelf and shelf-break waters of a meridional transect along 120 degrees E, Integrated production over the mixed layer ranged from greater than 700 mg C m(-2) d(-1) slightly north of the AD along 80 degrees E, to less than 50 mg C m (-2) d(-1) in open ocean water at the northeastern corner of the survey area. The elevated biomass and productivity west of approximately 120 degrees E was attributed to macro- and micro-nutrient release and upper water column stratification following the spring/summer ice melt that preceded and coincided with the sampling period, Macronutrient concentrations were not found to be limiting, and in the upper 75 m of the water column ranged between 20.8 and 33.7 mu M for nitrate, from 0.75 to 2.3 mu M for phosphate, and from 22.6 to 74.9 mu M for silicate. Nutrient uptake rates, inferred From depletion in the mixed layer, indicated that silicate uptake was uncoupled from that of nitrate and phosphate in the northeastern region of the survey area. The mixed layer deepened slightly and critical depths shoaled by a factor of three as the survey moved eastwards from 80 to 150 degrees E, a pattern most likely due to the onset of winter. Daily irradiance also decreased between January and March, and manipulations of the light field used in the production modelling of the eastern transects resulted in productivity estimates similar to the western transects. These observations, together with the analysis of the FRR data, suggest that the phytoplankton community east of approximately 120 degrees E may have been co-limited by iron concentrations and incident irradiance. The lower biomass and productivity in the east also coincided with greater southwards extension of warmer oceanic waters, and a shift from a krill/diatom to salp/picoplankton biological community.

To accomplish this, 38 and 120 kHz echo-sounders, found on most fisheries research vessels, were utilized. A two-frequency method using a highpass fluid sphere scattering model was employed to estimate the mean size (length) and the density per m(3) of the dominant acoustic scatterers (mainly euphausiids and shrimps), by selected depth layer. Three locations were surveyed: the Gulf of St Lawrence, the Antarctic, and the Irish Sea. Ground-truth samples were collected from various plankton net systems, the catches being compared to the acoustic estimates. Results are discussed with regard to conditions that apply to the method, the ground-truth performance and the relative complexity of the zooplankton composition at the different study sites.

The purpose of this study was to use carbon and nitrogen stable isotopes to provide insights into the trophic ecology and to determine the inter-annual variation of the diet of the humpback whales in the Magellan Strait. During 2011 and 2012, an analysis was carried out to determine the isotopic composition of humpback whale skin. We used a Bayesian isotope mixing model to determine the relative contribution of prey species to the isotopic value of the consumer. The humpback whale had mean values of-16.3 +/- 0.6%c in delta C-13 and 14.7 +/- 1.0 parts per thousand in delta N-15 (n = 33). The delta C-13 and delta C-13 in both the whales and the Fuegian sprat (Spratrus fueguensis) were significantly higher in 2011 compared to 2012. Additionally, females had significantly higher delta N-15 values in 2012; however, mean delta C-13 and delta N-15 values of whales within each season and between age classes did not differ statistically. A variation was observed in the contribution of different prey to the whale diet between the study years, with Fuegian sprat as the predominant prey during 2011 (mean 55 +/- 12%), and crustaceans dominating the diet in 2012 (mean 82 +/- 9%). This study confirms the diet of the humpback-whale within the Magellan Strait. Furthermore, isotopic analyses suggest important inter-annual changes due to (1) changes in the proportion of the species being consumed, probably due to variations in availability (e.g., abundance) of prey; and/or (2) annual isotopic changes at the base of the food web. Further studies are required on the population dynamics of prey in order to monitor annual changes in abundance and food supply.

Trophic ecology of Grey-headed albatrosses from Marion Island, Southern Ocean: insights from stomach contents and diet tracers	MARINE BIOLOGY												During chick-rearing, albatrosses can alternate between long foraging trips that provide the main source of food for the adults and short foraging trips that they use to feed their young. This flexibility in foraging behaviour can lead to differences in diet composition between adults and chicks and implies that they may be vulnerable in different ways to food shortages. The trophic ecology of the Grey-headed albatross Thalassarche chrysostoma was investigated at the sub-Antarctic Prince Edward Islands during the chick-rearing period in April 2006 using a combination of approaches. Diets of adults and chicks were assessed using stable isotope ratios and fatty acid (FA) profiles of blood and/or stomach oils, in addition to stomach contents analysis. Fish from the family Macrouridae and cephalopods (particularly the onychoteuthid Kondakovia longimana) were the primary prey, whereas crustaceans (krill Euphausia superba) represented a smaller proportion of the stomach contents. Stomach oil FA profiles contained more monounsaturated FA than the profiles of plasma, which were richer in saturated FA and arachidonic acid (20:4n-6). There was also a distinct separation of adults from chicks, with higher levels of monounsaturates in chick plasma, and higher saturated FA levels (particularly 16:0) in the adult plasma. Stable carbon isotope ratios of whole blood were similar in adults and chicks, whereas stable nitrogen isotope ratios showed significant enrichment by > 1aEuro degrees in chicks. The combined FA, stable isotopes and stomach contents analyses suggest clear differences in diet quality between adults and chicks, with chicks feeding at a higher trophic position through feeding more on highly nutritious fish and adults keeping much of the less nutritious zooplankton for themselves.

The upper 300 m water column consists of three distinctive thermohaline characteristics. The surface layer (50 m) of summer surface water formed by seasonal warming with temperatures (0-2 degrees C) and low salinity (< 33.8 PSU), the intermediate layer (50-150 m) of winter reminiscent water with negative temperatures (0 to -2 degrees C) and moderate salinity (33.8-34.3 PSU) and the deeper layer (below 150 m) of Circumpolar Deep Watermass (CDW) with positive temperatures (0-2 degrees C) and higher salinity (34.3-34.8PSU). The influence of the strong Antarctic Divergence between the east and west drifts is noticed at 61 degrees S, 34 degrees E marked by phytoplankton and zooplankton patches. The dissolved oxygen (DO) shows high concentrations (7.6 to >8.0 ml l(-1)) in the upper layer, These higher levels of DO sometimes extend down to the intermediate layer and gradually decrease further downwards. The observed low temperature and high DO in the subsurface water (50-75 m) are typical signatures of Antarctic Winter Watermass (AWW) formed during winter, Calcium, magnesium and boron show significant spatial variations with higher values of Ca and Mg along 59 degrees S and 60 degrees S relative to 61 degrees S, Ca exhibits large variations (398-421 mg kg(-1) while Mg shows least variations with concentrations close to the average value for normal sea water (1294 mg kg(-1)). Boron depicts high values along 59 degrees S and 61 degrees S compared to 60 degrees S, with higher values in the subsurface layer (25-75 m) which are attributed to biological characteristics and the frontal systems in the region. Phytoplankton cell counts remain high (between 1.92 and 22.9 x 10(4) per litre) while zooplankton biomass shows variations from 9.8 to 303.62 ml 100 m(-3). A marked drop of both phytoplankton and zooplankton in the region of krill swarm (between 60 degrees 40'-61 degrees 13'S and 33 degrees 34'-34 degrees 14'E), however, indicates active feeding by the latter on the planktonic communities.																	0011-3891					NOV 25	1999	77	10					1273	1282									WOS:000084144500017						
J	Quillfeldt, P; McGill, RAR; Furness, RW				Quillfeldt, P; McGill, RAR; Furness, RW			Diet and foraging areas of Southern Ocean seabirds and their prey inferred from stable isotopes: review and case study of Wilson's storm-petrel	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												Analysis of stable isotope ratios in animal tissues has emerged as a powerful tool for determining the trophic level and composition of prey and foraging location. We summarize here data on the stepwise trophic enrichment in delta(15) N and latitudinal gradient in delta C-13 in the Southern Ocean, and derive a regression equation to estimate latitudes from delta C-13 values. We analysed isotope ratios of feathers of the small, pelagic seabird Wilson's storm-petrel Oceanites oceanicus, in different breeding stages, in comparison to isotope ratios of 4 other seabird species breeding in close vicinity on King George Island, South Shetland Islands. 615 N analysis of feathers and albumen from Wilson's storm-petrels indicated a shift in diet from mainly crustaceans during egg formation to an increased proportion of fish during chick-feeding and moulting. 615 N values of Wilson's storm-petrels during the chick-rearing season were closer to the mainly piscivorous-carnivorous skuas than to krill-feeding penguins, confirming that fish is an important part of their diet. VC analysis of feathers identified 4 distinct foraging areas: VC values in egg-white suggest that egg-forming females moved south to the sea ice edge. This coincides with the distribution of their main prey, Antarctic krill Euphausia superba, during this period. During the breeding season, Wilson's storm-petrels fed in the area around the colony, which is also used by penguins and skuas. VC of the feathers indicate that adults migrated to the Subtropical Front and beyond (north of 44 degrees S) during the inter-breeding period. Feathers were also analysed from 10 Wilson's storm-petrels caught by mistnet and thought to be prebreeders because they lacked foot markings; 8 of these had moulted in the same area as breeding birds, while 2 birds had moulted in an area further north (north of 30 degrees S). Adelie penguins Pygoscelis adeliae and Gentoo penguins F papua had significantly different VC, suggesting that the Adelie penguins foraged further south than the Gentoo penguins. The foraging areas of brown skuas Stercorarius antarctica and south polar skuas S. maccormicki could not be separated by their isotope ratios.

Biogeochemical processes within the Southern Ocean regulate regional primary production and biological carbon uptake, primarily through iron supply, and support ecosystem functioning over a range of spatial and temporal scales. Here, we assimilate existing knowledge and present new data to examine the biogeochemical cycles of iron, carbon and major nutrients, their key drivers and their responses to, and roles in, contemporary climate and environmental change. Projected increases in iron supply, coupled with increases in light availability to phytoplankton through increased near-surface stratification and longer ice-free periods, are very likely to increase primary production and carbon export around Antarctica. Biological carbon uptake is likely to increase for the Southern Ocean as a whole, whilst there is greater uncertainty around projections of primary production in the Sub-Antarctic and basin-wide changes in phytoplankton species composition, as well as their biogeochemical consequences. Phytoplankton, zooplankton, higher trophic level organisms and microbial communities are strongly influenced by Southern Ocean biogeochemistry, in particular through nutrient supply and ocean acidification. In turn, these organisms exert important controls on biogeochemistry through carbon storage and export, nutrient recycling and redistribution, and benthic-pelagic coupling. The key processes described in this paper are summarised in the Graphical Abstract. Climate-mediated changes in Southern Ocean biogeochemistry over the coming decades are very likely to impact primary production, sea-air CO2 exchange and ecosystem functioning within and beyond this vast and critically important ocean region.

Distribution of squid and fish in the pelagic zone of the Cosmonaut Sea and Prydz Bay region during the BROKE-West campaign	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY												The composition and distribution of squid and fish collected by Rectangular Midwater Trawls in the upper 200 m were investigated during the BROKE-West (Baseline Research on Oceanography, Krill and the Environment-West) survey (January-March 2006) in CCAMLR Subdivision 58.4.2 of the Southern Ocean. A total of 332 individuals were collected, with the most abundant fish species being Pleuragramma antarcticum (34%), Notolepis coatsi (27%) and Electrona antarctica (26%); and the most abundant squid being Galiteuthis glacialis (64%). Abundances of all species were among the lowest recorded using this type of gear. Cluster analysis revealed two distinct communities: a notothenioid-dominated coastal community and an oceanic community dominated by mesopelagic fish and squid. Environmental factors related to this segregation were explored using Redundancy Analysis (RDA). The notothenioid P. antarcticum was associated with shallow areas with high chlorophyll a concentrations. Larval stages of E. antarctica, N. coatsi and G. glacialis were found over deeper water and were positively correlated with higher temperatures and a deeper-reaching mixed layer. Postmetamorphic stages of E. antarctica were caught mostly after sunset and were negatively correlated with solar elevation. The observation of higher densities in the eastern part of the sampling area reflects a temporal rather than a geographical effect. Samples of the three most abundant fishes, E. antarctica, P. antarcticum and N. coatsi, were analysed for gut content. All species fed on a variety of mesozooplankton including copepods, amphipods and euphausiids, which is consistent with previous reports on similar life stages. Mean body energy density was highest for E. antarctica (27 kJ g(-1)), while it was similar for P. antarcticum and N. coatsi (22 kJ g(-1)). The high energy content emphasizing the importance as a food resource for top predators in the Southern Ocean. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

IMPLICATIONS OF LONG-TERM CLIMATE CHANGE FOR BIOGEOGRAPHY AND ECOLOGICAL PROCESSES IN THE SOUTHERN OCEAN	OCEANOGRAPHY AND MARINE BIOLOGY: AN ANNUAL REVIEW, VOL 56	Oceanography and Marine Biology											Understanding the long-term consequences of climate change for Southern Ocean ecosystems is important because this is one of the last remaining wildernesses on the planet and because the Southern Ocean is a major driver of global climate. The Southern Ocean is roughly the size of Africa and experiences exceptional seasonality. Its many habitats include the permanently open ocean, sea ice, frontal systems and neritic waters, and different zonal (east-west) and meridional (north-south) regions are on different trajectories in terms of climate, sea ice cover and biological populations. The Western Antarctic Peninsula has experienced substantial warming, loss of sea ice and declining Adelie penguin populations, while eastern Antarctica has cooled, shown increased ice cover and increasing numbers of Adelies. In the ocean itself, warming seems to be concentrated north of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current and at depth rather than in surface waters. Densities of Antarctic krill are correlated with ice cover in the previous winter and in the south-west Atlantic have decreased over the last century while salps have shown increasing numbers south of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current. Even in this example, the mechanisms involved are uncertain, making predictions difficult. The historic loss of an enormous biomass of consumers through fisheries, led to top- down ecological effects including competitive release among predators. These pelagic food webs are, however, strongly physically forced, making them particularly vulnerable to changes in environmental conditions. The size and species composition of the primary producers affect food chain length and the efficiency of the biological pump. Critically, the primary producer community is profoundly shaped by factors influencing the availability of light (e.g. season, ice melt and water column stability), micro and macronutrients. Changes in these will have deeply important bottom-up effects, and this brings us to defining biogeography. In these pelagic systems, biogeographic provinces are defined by the frontal systems that delineate sharp discontinuities in conditions in the water column and the taxa that dominate primary production. Because these are not geographically fixed, changes in biogeography in this context describe the expansion, contraction or simple displacement of biomes. The associated food webs revolve around a small number of key species that differ among habitats and biomes. They are not simple, exhibit considerable flexibility and include a number of taxa, particularly the cephalopods, that are difficult to sample and remain poorly studied. A major difficulty in understanding how climate change is likely to manifest is the brevity of relevant datasets. We have few physical or biological benchmarks to use in separating short-term noise from long-term signal. As a physical example, Southern Ocean fronts can exhibit short-term meridional shifts of >100 km in a matter of weeks. Biologically, regional differences in trajectories of Adelie penguin numbers need to be viewed against the background of substantial variability over the last 45,000 years. Except for ice or sediment cores, such data are available for few variables or species. In addition, research efforts are geographically unbalanced for logistic reasons. Remote sensing and the Argo float programme reduce this problem by increasing spatial coverage enormously for some variables, but not others, and even then offer relatively new time series. Important variables that are undergoing, or will undergo, change include: sea ice cover (essentially habitat loss), sea temperatures, wind and mixing regimes, the positions of fronts, ultraviolet levels and ocean pH. Many of these will have interacting effects, and the areas likely to be exposed to multiple environmental changes far exceed those already experiencing important changes. Species are potentially vulnerable to stressors at all ontogenetic stages and in many cases sublethal effects (e.g. on reproductive success) are likely to affect population dynamics before stressors reach lethal levels. Likely, and complicated, will be possible changes to the microbial plankton, including increased microbe deposition by aeolian dust and greater susceptibility of potential hosts to viral infection because of other stresses. All these stressors can have direct and interacting effects as well as indirect effects. For example, meridional shifts in frontal positions will alter the foraging ranges of top predators that are land-based during the breeding season. The ecosystem-level consequences will depend on individual species reactions, including the rates at which they can respond and stressors to which they respond, with the potential disruption of species interactions through different phenological responses. Perhaps the key characteristic of predictions for the effects of climate change on the Southern Ocean lies in an even greater degree of uncertainty than the norm.

However, long-term intake of diets supplemented with different polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) can affect bone metabolism; thus, this study investigated the comparative effects of Antarctic krill oil (AKO, containing n-3 PUFAs) and arachidonic acid-rich oil (AAO, containing n-6 PUFAs) on bone resorption in a mice model of postmenopausal osteoporosis. Mice were orally administered with AKO (200 mg kg(-1)) or AAO (220 mg kg(-1)) once daily for 30 days, ovariectomized, followed by the continued administration of the respective samples for 90 days. Biomechanical and histomorphometric analyses revealed that AKO increased the bone mineral density (BMD) to enhance the biomechanical properties by increasing the mineral apposition rate and repairing the microstructure of the trabecular bone, whereas AAO had the opposite effect. The fatty acid analysis of the vertebra showed that AKO increased the n-3 PUFA (especially for DHA) content, thereby decreasing the ratio of n-6/n-3 PUFAs, which was negatively correlated with the BMD. However, AAO had the opposite effect due to high amounts of arachidonic acid. To explore the underlying mechanism responsible for these observations, we compared the classical bone resorption OPG/RANKL/NF-kappa B pathway mediated by PGE(2)/EP4. The ratio of n-6/n-3 PUFAs in the bone affected the production of PGE(2), a factor regulating the OPG/RANKL pathway, thereby regulating osteoclastogenesis by stimulating the NF-kappa B pathway. The results of ELISA, qRT-PCR, and western blot demonstrated that AKO reduced the secretion of PGE(2)and the expression of EP4, upregulating the ratio of OPG/RANKL in the bone, thereby decreasing TRAF6 expression to inhibit the activation of the NF-kappa B signaling pathway, and finally inhibiting the expression of nuclear transcription factors (c-fos and NFATc1) to prevent excessive osteoclastogenesis (TRACP, MMP-9, and Cath-K). Arachidonic acid is a precursor of PGE(2)synthesis. AAO showed the opposite trend through the same pathway. Thus, AKO could significantly improve osteoporosisviathe OPG/RANKL/NF-kappa B pathway mediated by PGE(2)/EP(4)to inhibit osteoclastogenesis, whereas AAO aggravated osteoporosisviathe same pathway. This is the first study to systematically compare the effects and mechanism of AKO and AAO in regulating bone resorption in osteoporotic mice to support recommendations on fatty acid types in dietary oils for an osteoporotic population.																	2042-6496	2042-650X				AUG 1	2020	11	8					7048	7060		10.1039/d0fo00884b							WOS:000560678100022	32813003

The specificity of the affinity-purified antibody (immunoglobulin G type) obtained from the serum was examined, using other glycosphingolipids and glyco-proteins structurally related to MlOse2Cer, by means of ELISA and TLC-immunostaining. The purified antibody was highly specific to MlOse2Cer and lacked reactivity with other glycolipids and glycoproteins including glucosylceramide, lactosylceramide, dimannosylglucosylceramide (MlOse3Cer), glucosaminylmannosylglucosylceramide (ArOse3Cer), thyroglobulin and alpha-1-acid glycoprotein. The antibody was found to bind, although less efficiently, to certain other compounds containing the group Man-beta-1-4Glc and/or Man-beta-1-4GlcNAc at their termini, such as MlOse2-sphingosine and Man-beta-1-4GlcNAc-beta-1-p-aminobenzoic acid ethylester derivatives. The present antibody was applied to the detection of the natural hapten in crustacean glycolipids. The purified antibody reacted with a neutral glycosphingolipid present in the two kinds of crustacean, Euphausia superba (antarctic krill) and Macrobrachium nipponense (fresh-water shrimp) as shown by TLC-immunostaining. The crustacean glycolipid antigen was isolated and characterized to be the Man-beta-1-4Glc-Cer. This is the first report on the presence of a mannose-containing glycosphingolipid in the crustacean.																	0006-3002					FEB 12	1992	1123	3					263	268		10.1016/0005-2760(92)90005-G							WOS:A1992HF18900005	1536864

A challenge in testing consistency of individual foraging strategy is the repeated collection of information on the same individuals. Methodology/Principal Findings: The foraging strategies of sympatric fur seals (Arctocephalus gazella and A. tropicalis) were examined using the stable isotope signature of serially sampled whiskers. Most whiskers exhibited synchronous delta C-13 and delta N-15 oscillations that correspond to the seal annual movements over the long term (up to 8 years). delta C-13 and delta N-15 values were spread over large ranges, with differences between species, sexes and individuals. The main segregating mechanism operates at the spatial scale. Most seals favored foraging in subantarctic waters (where the Crozet Islands are located) where they fed on myctophids. However, A. gazella dispersed in the Antarctic Zone and A. tropicalis more in the subtropics. Gender differences in annual time budget shape the seal movements. Males that do not perform any parental care exhibited large isotopic oscillations reflecting broad annual migrations, while isotopic values of females confined to a limited foraging range during lactation exhibited smaller changes. Limited inter-individual isotopic variations occurred in female seals and in male A. tropicalis. In contrast, male A. gazella showed large inter-individual variations, with some males migrating repeatedly to high-Antarctic waters where they fed on krill, thus meaning that individual specialization occurred over years. Conclusions/Significance: Whisker isotopic signature yields unique long-term information on individual behaviour that integrates the spatial, trophic and temporal dimensions of the ecological niche. The method allows depicting the entire realized niche of the species, including some of its less well-known components such as age-, sex-, individual- and migration-related changes. It highlights intrapopulation heterogeneity in foraging strategies that could have important implications for likely demographic responses to environmental variability.

Pelagic Iron Recycling in the Southern Ocean: Exploring the Contribution of Marine Animals	FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE												The availability of iron controls primary productivity in large areas of the Southern Ocean. Iron is largely supplied via atmospheric dust deposition, melting ice, the weathering of shelf sediments, upwelling, sediment resuspension, mixing (deep water, biogenic, and vertical mixing) and hydrothermal vents with varying degrees of temporal and spatial importance. However, large areas of the Southern Ocean are remote from these sources, leading to regions of low primary productivity. Recent studies suggest that recycling of iron by animals in the surface layer could enhance primary productivity in the Southern Ocean. The aim of this review is to provide a quantitative and qualitative assessment of the current literature on pelagic iron recycling by marine animals in the Southern Ocean and highlight the next steps forward in quantifying the retention and recycling of iron by higher trophic levels in the Southern Ocean. Phytoplankton utilize the iron in seawater to meet their metabolic demand. Through grazing, pelagic herbivores transfer the iron in phytoplankton cells into their body tissues and organs. Herbivores can recycle iron through inefficient feeding behavior that release iron into the water before ingestion, and through the release of fecal pellets. The iron stored within herbivores is transferred to higher trophic levels when they are consumed. When predators consume iron beyond their metabolic demand it is either excreted or defecated. Waste products from pelagic vertebrates can thus contain high concentrations of iron which may be in a form that is available to phytoplankton. Bioavailability of fecal iron for phytoplankton growth is influenced by a combination of the size of the fecal particle, presence of organic ligands, the oxidation state of the iron, as well as biological (e.g., remineralization, coprochaly, coprorhexy, and coprophagy) and physical (e.g., dissolution, fragmentation) processes that lead to the degradation and release of fecal iron. The flux of dissolved iron from pelagic recycling is comparable to other sources in the region such as atmospheric dust, vertical diffusivity, vertical flux, lateral flux and upwelling, but lower than sea ice, icebergs, sediment resuspension, and deep winter mixing. The temporal and seasonal importance of these various factors requires further examination.

A genomic DNA library of strain 643A was introduced into Escherichia coli TOP10F', and screening on tributyrin-containing agar plates led to the isolation of esterase gene. The esterase gene (estA, 621 bp) encoded a protein (EstA) of 207 amino acid residues with molecular mass of 23,036 Da. Analysis of the amino acid sequence of EstA suggests that it is a member of the GDSL-lipolytic enzymes family. The purification and characterization of native EstA esterase were performed. The enzyme displayed 20-50% of maximum activity at 0-20 degrees C. The optimal temperature for EstA was 35 degrees C. EstA was stable between pH 9 and 11.5. The enzyme showed activity for esters of short- to medium-chain (C-4 and C-10) fatty acids, and exhibited no activity for long-chain fatty acid esters like that of palmitate and stearate. EstA was strongly inhibited by phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2-mercaptoethanol, dithiothreitol and glutathione. Addition of selected divalent ions e.g. Mg2+, Co2+ and Cu2+ led to the reduction of enzymatic activity and the enzyme was slightly activated (similar to 30%) by Ca2+ ions.

ENZYME REGULATION OF SELECTED CRUSTACEANS WITH REGARD TO LIFE-STYLE AND THE CLIMATIC ZONE	JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE PHYSIOLOGY B-BIOCHEMICAL SYSTEMIC AND ENVIRONMENTAL PHYSIOLOGY												Citrate synthase is a regulatory enzyme of the energy metabolism pathway controlling the citric acid cycle. It was studied in order to determine modes of enzyme regulation with regard to the life-style of the investigated species. Citrate synthase from crustaceans with different life-styles were compared: the pelagic euphausiids Euphausia superba from the Antarctic and Meganyctiphanes norvegica from the Scandinavian Kattegat and the Mediterranean were compared to the benthic isopods Serolis polita from the Antarctic and Idotea baltica from the Baltic. Citrate synthase was partly purified chromatographically and the influence of adenosine 5'-triphosphate on enzyme activity was examined. Mechanisms of inhibition and inhibitor constants were determined. Two different mechanisms of enzyme regulation by ATP were found. Citrate synthase from isopods was only competitively inhibited. while citrate synthase from euphausiids showed not only competitive inhibition but also activation by low concentrations of ATP. This activation is equivalent to the reversed mechanism of uncompetitive inhibition. The ecophysiological relevances of the coupling of these mechanisms are discussed. The degree of competitive inhibition was different in the two groups of investigated crustaceans. Inhibitor constants were similar within the euphausiids but not in isopods. which showed higher or lower inhibition depending on the climatic zone: the colder the ambient temperature the lower the ATP inhibition. A possible mechanism of temperature adaptation through effects of varying inhibition constants is concluded.																	0174-1578	1432-136X				APR	1995	165	1					56	61		10.1007/BF00264686							WOS:A1995QX90900007

In addition to sequestering atmospheric CO2, the biological carbon pump also supplies organic matter (OM) to deep-ocean ecosystems. Although the total flux of OM arriving at the seafloor sets the energy input to the system, the chemical nature of OM is also of significance. However, a quantitative framework linking ecological flux vectors to OM composition is currently lacking. In the present study we report the lipid composition of export fluxes collected by five moored sediment traps deployed in contrasting productivity regimes of Southern Ocean island systems (Kerguelen, Crozet and South Georgia) and compile them with quantitative data on diatom and faecal pellet fluxes. At the three naturally iron-fertilized sites, the relative contribution of labile lipids (mono-and polyunsaturated fatty acids, unsaturated fatty alcohols) is 2-4 times higher than at low productivity sites. There is a strong attenuation of labile components as a function of depth, irrespective of productivity. The three island systems also display regional characteristics in lipid export. An enrichment of zooplankton dietary sterols, such as C-27 Delta(5), at South Georgia is consistent with high zooplankton and krill biomass in the region and the importance of faecal pellets to particulate organic carbon (POC) flux. There is a strong association of diatom resting spore fluxes that dominate productive flux regimes with energy-rich unsaturated fatty acids. At the Kerguelen Plateau we provide a statistical framework to link seasonal variation in ecological flux vectors and lipid composition over a complete annual cycle. Our analyses demonstrate that ecological processes in the upper ocean, e.g. resting spore formation and grazing, not only impact the magnitude and stoichiometry of the Southern Ocean biological pump, but also regulate the composition of exported OM and the nature of pelagic-benthic coupling.				blain, stephane/F-6917-2010; Salter, Ian/AAI-1015-2021	blain, stephane/0000-0002-5234-2446; 												1726-4170	1726-4189				MAY 18	2018	15	9					3071	3084		10.5194/bg-15-3071-2018							WOS:000432490500001

Biology of Salpa thompsoni in waters adjacent to the Ross Sea, Southern Ocean, during austral summer 2008	POLAR BIOLOGY												Depth-stratified vertical sampling was carried out during the New Zealand International Polar Year cruise to the Ross Sea on board the RV Tangaroa in February March 2008. The distribution (horizontal and vertical), density and population biology of Salpa thompsoni were investigated. Salps were found at two of the four major sampling locations, e.g. near the continental slope of the Ross Sea and in the vicinity of seamounts to the north of the Ross Sea. Both abundance and biomass of S. thompsoni were highest near the seamounts in the Antarctic Circumpolar Current reaching similar to 2,500 ind 1,000 m(-3) and 8.2 g dry wt 1,000 m(-3) in the water column sampled. The data showed that S. thompsoni populations were able to utilize horizontal and vertical discontinuities in water column structure, in particular the warm Circumpolar Deep Water (CDW), to persist in the high Antarctic. Although salps appeared to continue migrating to the surface colder layers to feed, both aggregate chain and young embryo release seem to be restricted to the CDW. This study for the first time has provided evidence that low Antarctic salp species may successfully reproduce in the hostile high Antarctic realm.

Bengtson; Waugh, Courtney A.; Schlabach, Martin			Metabolic Concentration of Lipid Soluble Organochlorine Burdens in the Blubber of Southern Hemisphere Humpback Whales Through Migration and Fasting	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Southern hemisphere humpback whales undertake the longest migrations and associated periods of fasting of any mammal. Fluctuations in lipid energy stores are known to profoundly affect the toxicokinetics of lipophilic organochlorine compound (OC) burdens. Results from blubber biopsy sampling of adult, male humpback whales at two time points of the annual migration journey revealed dramatic concentration effects for the majority of OC compounds. The observed concentration effect was, however, not linear with measured average blubber lipid loss indicating significant redistribution of OCs and hence the importance of alternate lipid depots for meeting the energetic demands of the migration journey. Applying lipophilic OC burdens as novel tracers of whole-body lipid dynamics, the observed average concentration index suggests an average individual weight loss of 13% over 4 months of the migration journey. This value is based upon lipid derived energy and is in good agreement with previous weight prediction formulas. Notably, however, these estimates may greatly underestimate individual weight loss if significant protein catabolism occurs. Biomagnification factors between migrating southern hemisphere humpback whales and their principal prey item, Antarctic krill, closely resembled those of baleen whales feeding on herbivorous zooplankton in the Arctic. This study emphasizes the importance of considering prolonged periods of food deprivation when assessing chemical risks posed to wildlife. This is of particular importance for Polar biota adapted to extremes in ecosystem productivity.

Evaluating the effectiveness of a large multi-use MPA in protecting Key Biodiversity Areas for marine predators	DIVERSITY AND DISTRIBUTIONS												Aim Marine protected areas can serve to regulate harvesting and conserve biodiversity. Within large multi-use MPAs, it is often unclear to what degree critical sites of biodiversity are afforded protection against commercial activities. Addressing this issue is a prerequisite if we are to appropriately assess sites against conservation targets. We evaluated whether the management regime of a large MPA conserved sites (Key Biodiversity Areas, KBAs) supporting the global persistence of top marine predators. Location Southwest Atlantic Ocean. Method We collated population and tracking data (1,418 tracks) from 14 marine predator species (Procellariiformes, Sphenisciformes, Pinnipedia) that breed at South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands, and identified hotspots for their conservation under the recently developed KBA framework. We then evaluated the spatiotemporal overlap of these sites and the different management regimes of krill, demersal longline and pelagic trawl fisheries operating within a large MPA, which was created with the intention to protect marine predator species. Results We identified 12 new global marine KBAs that are important for this community of top predators, both within and beyond the focal MPA. Only three species consistently used marine areas at a time when a potentially higher-risk fishery was allowed to operate in that area, while other interactions between fisheries and our target species were mostly precluded by MPA management plans. Main conclusions We show that current fishery management measures within the MPA contribute to protecting top predators considered in this study and that resource harvesting within the MPA does not pose a major threat-under current climate conditions. Unregulated fisheries beyond the MPA, however, pose a likely threat to identified KBAs. Our approach demonstrates the utility of the KBA guidelines and multispecies tracking data to assess the contributing role of well-designed MPAs in achieving local and internationally agreed conservation targets.

J	Perissinotto, R; Pakhomov, EA				Perissinotto, R; Pakhomov, EA			Contribution of salps to carbon flux of marginal ice zone of the Lazarev sea, southern ocean	MARINE BIOLOGY												In order to estimate the in situ grazing rates of Salpa thompsoni and their implications for the development of phytoplankton blooms and for the sequestration of biogenic carbon in the high Antarctic, a repeat-grid survey and drogue study were carried out in the Lazarev Sea during austral summer of 1994/1995 (December/January). Exceptionally high grazing rates were measured for S. thompsoni at the onset of a phytoplankton bloom (0.2 to 0.8 mu g chlorophyll a l(-1)) in December 1994, with up to similar or equal to 160 mu g of plant pigments consumed by an individual salp of 7 to 10 cm length per day. Dense salp swarms extended throughout the marginal ice zone, consuming up to 108% of daily phytoplankton production and 21% of the total chlorophyll a stock. Due to the much faster sinking rates and higher carbon content of salp faecal pellets, the efficiency of downward carbon flux through salps is much higher than through the other major grazers, krill and copepods. S. thompsoni can thus export large amounts of biogenic carbon from the euphotic zone to the deep ocean. With the observed ingestion rates during December 1994, this flux could have attained levels of up to 88 mg C m(-2) d(-1), accounting for the bulk of the vertical transport of carbon in the Lazarev Sea. However, in January 1995, when phytoplankton concentrations exceeded a threshold level of 1.0 to 1.5 mu g chlorophyll a l(-1), salps experienced a drastic reduction in their feeding efficiency, possibly as a result of clogging of their filtering apparatus. This triggered a dramatic reversal in the relationship, during which a dense phytoplankton bloom developed in conjunction with the collapse of the salp population. Increases in the biomass and geographic range of the tunicate S. thompsoni have occurred in several areas of the southern ocean, often in parallel with a rise in sea-surface temperature during sub-decadal periods of warming anomalies.																	0025-3162					APR	1998	131	1					25	32		10.1007/s002270050292							WOS:000073613500003

Mercury biomagnification in a Southern Ocean food web	ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION												Biomagnification of mercury (Hg) in the Scotia Sea food web of the Southern Ocean was examined using the stable isotope ratios of nitrogen (delta N-15) and carbon (delta C-13) as proxies for trophic level and feeding habitat, respectively. Total Hg and stable isotopes were measured in samples of particulate organic matter (POM), zooplankton, squid, myctophid fish, notothenioid fish and seabird tissues collected in two years (austral summers 2007/08 and 2016/17). Overall, there was extensive overlap in delta C-13 values across taxonomic groups suggesting similarities in habitats, with the exception of the seabirds, which showed some differences, possibly due to the type of tissue analysed (feathers instead of muscle). delta N-15 showed increasing enrichment across groups in the order POM to zooplankton to squid to myctophid fish to notothenioid fish to seabirds. There were significant differences in delta N-15 and delta C-13 values among species within taxonomic groups, reflecting inter-specific variation in diet. Hg concentrations increased with trophic level, with the lowest values in POM (0.0005 +/- 0.0002 mg g(-1) dw) and highest values in seabirds (3.88 +/- 2.41 mg g(-1) in chicks of brown skuas Stercorarius antarcticus). Hg concentrations tended to be lower in 2016/17 than in 2007/08 for mid-trophic level species (squid and fish), but the opposite was found for top predators (i.e. seabirds), which had higher levels in the 2016/17 samples. This may reflect an interannual shift in the Scotia Sea marine food web, caused by the reduced availability of a key prey species, Antarctic krill Euphausia superba. In 2016/17, seabirds would have been forced to feed on higher trophic-level prey, such as myctophids, that have higher Hg burdens. These results suggest that changes in the food web are likely to affect the pathway of mercury to Southern Ocean top predators. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

During chick-rearing (2000-01), we compared the foraging trips, diet and breeding parameters of two Adelie penguin colonies in the Ross Sea, at Edmonson Point (EdPo; 2000 breeding pairs) and Inexpressible Island (InIs; 24 000 breeding pairs). Penguins from InIs travelled farther and performed longer feeding trips. The quantity of food brought to the nest was the same for the two colonies, but penguins from InIs brought more fish and less krill. Eggs hatched earlier at EdPo. Breeding success did not differ, but chick weight during hatching-fledging was greater at InIs. Despite worse weather conditions at InIs, the larger proportion of high-energy food brought by penguins from InIs (i.e. fish) may explain their offspring's better performance. In addition, the persistence of fast ice at EdPo may have led to greater energy expenditure of breeding individuals, possibly reducing chick growth. The greater intraspecific competition expected at InIs may have been reduced by longer foraging trips and/or counteracted by the more nutritious diet. Our findings reveal complex trade-offs between foraging effort and environmental constraints in determining the breeding performance of Adelie penguins.

J	Emsley, SM; Tarling, GA; Burrows, MT				Emsley, SM; Tarling, GA; Burrows, MT			The effect of vertical migration strategy on retention and dispersion in the Irish Sea during spring-summer	FISHERIES OCEANOGRAPHY												A biophysical model of the Irish Sea was produced to predict net horizontal movement of key taxa including small copepods (Acartia, Pseudocalanus), large copepod species (Calanus finmarchicus and C. helgolandicus), the euphausiid Meganyctiphanes norvegica, and the larval stages of commercially important fish and Nephrops. The model coupled biological information on the vertical distribution and diel vertical migration (DVM) of these taxa with temporally resolved flow fields generated by a baroclinic hydrodynamic model. The DVM of Calanus spp. and Meganyctiphanes was parameterized empirically from data provided by a biophysical campaign carried out in the nearby Clyde Sea. Small copepods and larvae remained within the layers above the thermocline. Model organisms, programmed with particular behavioural patterns, were spaced at regular intervals (1/20 degrees longitude x 1/30 degrees latitude) in the model grid, which extended from 53 to 54.5 degrees N and 4.5 to 6.4 degrees W. The model was run over the months of April, May and June. Model simulations showed that the movement of model organisms followed one of four characteristic patterns: containment along the coast, advection to the north or south, stagnation in the centre of the gyre or circulation around the periphery of the gyre. The latter pattern was apparent even in April, when gyral circulation was not expected because of a lack of stratification in the water column. Thirty-day model runs in April, May and June showed that the number of organisms retained within the model grid varied between 23 and 49%. Those seeded close to the Irish coast had the highest probability of being retained within the model grid at the end of 90 days. DVM increased the probability of retention through improving the chances of organisms becoming entrained within the gyre circulation. This was especially true for Calanus spp., with those performing midnight sinking being the most likely to be retained out of any model organism. Meganyctiphanes showed comparatively lower levels of retention in deep regions, which suggests that they may have to swim against currents during certain phases of their DVM to avoid displacement. Overall, model results supported a number of hypotheses on the origin and fate of various taxa in the Irish Sea, as well as revealing some less expected distribution patterns.

DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY												Salmon aquaculture is in great need of good quality balanced protein and lipid sources, particularly marine omega-3 (n-3) long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC-PUFA), to sustain a further development of the in-dustry. One possibility is to harvest mesopelagic marine layers. Therefore, the current project analysed mesopelagic hauls from three cruises (November 2015 to October 2016) collected from the inner fjord systems around Bergen and in open-waters off TromsO and angstrom lesund, Norway. Jellyfish, krill, shrimps and small amounts of the mesopelagic fish, Maurolicus muelleri and Benthosema glaciale, dominated the mixed mesopelagic hauls. Lipid content ranged between 35-40% of dry matter with two samples from autumn being 21 and 13%, with the latter haul being almost exclusively krill. In contrast, M. muelleri and B. glaciale had lipid contents of around 54 and 47% respectively. Overall, lipid was a relatively good source of marine n-3 LC-PUFA, EPA and DHA, being in the range of 15-20% of fatty acids which increased in lean samples. However, many of the trawl hauls contained wax esters (7 out of 9 hauls), equivalent to 40% or more of the lipid, with B. glaciale containing almost 90% wax esters of lipid. This presents a challenge if used in salmon diets, as their utilisation is limited. Protein contents ranged between 45-50%, increasing in lean samples. The essential amino acid content was well above the requirements for Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) with B. glaciale generally containing higher levels compared to M. muelleri. Leucine, lysine and valine levels were particularly high. Hauls from open-waters contained mixtures of amphipods resulting in cadmium levels exceeding the maximum allowable level in feedstuffs. Arsenic levels were high or borderline. Reducing crustacean mix in hauls appear to be the only option to reduce these levels, whereas mesopelagic fish contained low levels of all heavy metals. In summary, the mesopelagic layer contains protein and lipid sources that could supply raw materials to the salmon aquaculture industry. However, high levels of wax esters, cadmium and arsenic needs to be addressed.

Investigating the utility of decapod crustacean eyestalks for age determination of two European spider crab species	FISHERIES RESEARCH												Until recently it was not thought possible to directly and accurately age crustacean species as any calcified structure that could preserve a record of chronological age is lost at moulting. Recent research has suggested that it may be possible to directly infer age from the number of endocuticular bands present within the eyestalks of snow crab (Chionoecetes opilio) and Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba). Using captive-reared Mediterranean spider crabs (Maja squinado), and wild-caught north-east Atlantic spider crabs (Maja brachydactyla), the present study aimed to determine if endocuticular bands of potentially annual periodicity are present within the eyestalks of these brachyurans. Although clear and readable bands were present within the endocuticle of their eyestalks, no bands of potentially annual periodicity were identified. The number of endocuticular bands did not correlate with the known-age of the M. squinado individuals; but did correlate positively with carapace length for both M. squinado and M. brachydactyla, suggesting they form as a result of growth and the size of individuals. It is hypothesised that these endocuticular bands, and potentially those identified by other studies purporting them to be annual growth bands, are in fact lamellae that appear due to the layers of calcite crystal aggregates interspersed with chitin and protein fibres that form the mineral of the cuticle in decapod crustaceans. Further research is needed to determine the processes that control and result in the deposition of crustacean cuticle, particularly during the post-moult period.

J	Hall-Aspland, SA; Hall, AP; Rogers, TL				Hall-Aspland, SA; Hall, AP; Rogers, TL			A new approach to the solution of the linear mixing model for a single isotope: application to the case of an opportunistic predator	OECOLOGIA												Mixing models are used to determine diets where the number of prey items are greater than one, however, the limitation of the linear mixing method is the lack of a unique solution when the number of potential sources is greater than the number (n) of isotopic signatures +1. Using the IsoSource program all possible combinations of each source contribution (0-100%) in preselected small increments can be examined and a range of values produced for each sample analysed. We propose the use of a Moore Penrose (M-P) pseudoinverse, which involves the inverse of a 2x2 matrix. This is easily generalized to the case of a single isotope with (p) prey sources and produces a specific solution. The Antarctic leopard seal (Hydrurga leptonyx) was used as a model species to test this method. This seal is an opportunistic predator, which preys on a wide range of species including seals, penguins, fish and krill. The M-P method was used to determine the contribution to diet from each of the four prey types based on blood and fur samples collected over three consecutive austral summers. The advantage of the M-P method was the production of a vector of fractions f for each predator isotopic value, allowing us to identify the relative variation in dietary proportions. Comparison of the calculated fractions from this method with 'means' from IsoSource allowed confidence in the new approach for the case of a single isotope, N.

One specimen, damaged but near the known maximum size, was found floating on the surface, and the other, a male subadult specimen, was captured by a pelagic trawl. Examination of the specimens, histological sections and analyses of tissue samples revealed that the muscular tissues of the tentacular stalks and the mantle contain a large amount of ammonium, more than 328 mM, a quantity that far exceeds that of Moroteuthis ingens (206.9 mM) and Moroteuthis robsoni (199.6 mM) from the South Tasman Rise. Catch data and published records suggest that the juveniles and subadults of K. longimana feed on krill in the epipelagic zone.																	0954-1020	1365-2079				JUN	1994	6	2					231	234		10.1017/S0954102094000350							WOS:A1994NP43700018

Ecological Segregation in Space, Time and Trophic Niche of Sympatric Planktivorous Petrels	PLOS ONE												The principle of competitive exclusion postulates that ecologically-similar species are expected to partition their use of resources, leading to niche divergence. The most likely mechanisms allowing such coexistence are considered to be segregation in a horizontal, vertical or temporal dimension, or, where these overlap, a difference in trophic niche. Here, by combining information obtained from tracking devices (geolocator-immersion and time depth recorders), stable isotope analyses of blood, and conventional morphometry, we provide a detailed investigation of the ecological mechanisms that explain the coexistence of four species of abundant, zooplanktivorous seabirds in Southern Ocean ecosystems (blue petrel Halobaena caerulea, Antarctic prion Pachyptila desolata, common diving petrel Pelecanoides urinatrix and South Georgian diving petrel P. georgicus). The results revealed a combination of horizontal, vertical and temporal foraging segregation during the breeding season. The stable isotope and morphological analyses reinforced this conclusion, indicating that each species occupied a distinct trophic space, and that this appears to reflect adaptations in terms of flight performance. In conclusion, the present study indicated that although there was a degree of overlap in some measures of foraging behaviour, overall the four taxa operated in very different ecological space despite breeding in close proximity. We therefore provide important insight into the mechanisms allowing these very large populations of ecologically-similar predators to coexist.

The system transmits a linear frequency modulated signal with a frequency sweep of 20-220 kHz. To increase the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), a very long ( 50 ms) signal is used, and pulse compression processing is applied to received echoes. To determine the accuracy and effectiveness of the system and method, the obtained measurements were compared with predictions by theoretical acoustic scattering models. According to the verification experiment for a sphere and cylinders, the mean absolute errors were < 0.30 dB and the correlation coefficients r were > 0.97 in the frequency range above 20-dB SNR (40-210 kHz for the cylinders). Our measurement system was thus very accurate. We then performed the experiment for a commercially important shrimp, sakura shrimp Lucensosergia lucens. The measured spectra of three samples (35-38 mm) were in good agreement with the predicted spectra using an assumed sound-speed contrast. The r values were > 0.88 in the frequency range above 20-dB SNR (approximately 110-190 kHz). The effectiveness of our new method for weakly scattering animals was confirmed.																	0919-9268	1444-2906				SEP	2021	87	5					627	638		10.1007/s12562-021-01532-7		AUG 2021					WOS:000682425200001

The western boundary current in the Bransfield Strait, Antarctica	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART I-OCEANOGRAPHIC RESEARCH PAPERS												The Bransfield Strait west of the Antarctic Peninsula has been considered as a highly productive region for all trophic levels from primary production, to zooplankton aggregations, especially krill, to birds and mammals. The western boundary current, referred to as the Bransfield Current, plays an important role in determining the transport and retention of biota in the Bransfield Strait. Following the study of surface current characteristics in the strait using 39 tracks of mixed-layer drifters deployed between 1988 and 1990, a high-resolution transect of temperature, salinity and current measurements crossing the Bransfield Current was conducted between 13 and 14 March 2004, for understanding its horizontal and vertical structure and dynamics. The results from current, temperature and salinity measurements using a vessel mounted narrow band acoustic doppler current profiler and conductivity-temperature-depth (CTD) sensors revealed the magnitude of this current of approximately 50 cm/s within a horizontal distance of 15 km associated with a narrow and deep density front 4-6 km wide and 500 m deep. The comparison between the direct current measurements and the geostrophic current estimates from the density field implies that the Bransfield Current is geostrophically balanced. The mechanism forming this current is explored with Sverdrup dynamics. Results indicate that the negative wind stress curl and beta-effect lead to a southwestward transport in the Bransfield Strait. When this transport is restricted by land and shelves, a narrow western boundary current is formed. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Using data collected over 9 d and 1500 km ocean, we focused on the behavior of 4 seabird species that are abundant in Antarctic waters: black-browed albatross Thalassarche melanophrys, white-chinned petrel Procellaria aequinoctialis, prion Pachyptila spp., and diving petrel Pelecanoides spp. We identified and recorded the behavior of the nearest neighbors of focal, flying individuals and demonstrated strong intraspecific associations for all 4 species. More conspecific neighbors of prions and diving petrels were also observed flying than expected due to chance. This result suggests that these birds may forage co-operatively with conspecifics. In contrast, more heterospecific neighbors were feeding than expected, and more heterospecific neighbors of white-chinned petrels, prions, and diving petrels were black-browed albatross and groups of penguins and Antarctic fur seals Arctocephalus gazella than expected by chance. We show that associations among foraging birds are not random and are not due to species-specific differences in foraging habitat. We present methods that can be used to measure and compare the strength of intra- and interspecific association among predators at sea. Our results suggest that local enhancement is an important component of the foraging strategies of Antarctic seabirds.																	0171-8630	1616-1599					2004	277						25	35		10.3354/meps277025							WOS:000224095900003

No state change in pelagic fish production and biodiversity during the Eocene-Oligocene transition	NATURE GEOSCIENCE												The Eocene/Oligocene (E/O) boundary (~33.9 million years ago) has been described as a state change in the Earth system marked by the permanent glaciation of Antarctica and a proposed increase in oceanic productivity. Here we quantified the response of fish production and biodiversity to this event using microfossil fish teeth (ichthyoliths) in seven deep-sea sediment cores from around the world. Ichthyolith accumulation rate (a proxy for fish biomass production) shows no synchronous trends across the E/O. Ichthyolith accumulation in the Southern Ocean and Pacific gyre sites is an order of magnitude lower than that in the equatorial and Atlantic sites, demonstrating that the Southern Ocean was not a highly productive ecosystem for fish before or after the E/O. Further, tooth morphotype diversity and assemblage composition remained stable across the interval, indicating little change in the biodiversity or ecological role of open-ocean fish. While the E/O boundary was a major global climate-change event, its impact on pelagic fish was relatively muted. Our results support recent findings of whale and krill diversification suggesting that the pelagic ecosystem restructuring commonly attributed to the E/O transition probably occurred much later, in the late Oligocene or Miocene. Marine fish biomass and diversity did not change during the Eocene-Oligocene transition despite widespread cooling and Antarctic ice sheet expansion, according to microfossil fish teeth records from a set of deep-sea cores.

Apparent digestibility was determined using standard substitution procedures and employing ytterbium as the digestibility marker. Test ingredients were used at a substitution rate of 500 g kg(-1) or 300 g kg(-1) for animal or plant ingredients, respectively. In each of the two digestibility experiments (n = 5, the reference and four substituted diets were fed to lobsters fitted with a balloon fecal collection device.

This is especially true in dynamic coastal marine systems, where planktonic food resources are diffuse and must be either physically or biologically concentrated to support upper trophic levels. In the Western Antarctic Peninsula, recent climate change has created new foraging sympatry between Adelie (Pygoscelis adeliae) and gentoo (P. papua) penguins in a known biological hotspot near Palmer Deep canyon. We used this recent sympatry as an opportunity to investigate how dynamic local oceanographic features affect aspects of the foraging ecology of these two species. Simulated particle trajectories from measured surface currents were used to investigate the co-occurrence of convergent ocean features and penguin foraging locations. Adelie penguin diving activity was restricted to the upper mixed layer, while gentoo penguins often foraged much deeper than the mixed layer, suggesting that Adelie penguins may be more responsive to dynamic surface convergent features compared to gentoo penguins. We found that, despite large differences in diving and foraging behavior, both shallow-diving Adelie and deeper-diving gentoo penguins strongly selected for surface convergent features. Furthermore, there was no difference in selectivity for shallow-versus deep-diving gentoo penguins. Our results suggest that these two mesopredators are selecting surface convergent features, however, how these surface signals are related to subsurface prey fields is unknown.

Maximal ammonium concentrations in the marginal ice zone amounted to more than 2-mu-mol N l-1 and remineralization rates in this zone were consistently higher than those measured in the adjacent open ocean and permanently ice-covered zones. At one station, characterized by a large kill swarm, the remineralization rate was 18 nmol N l-1 h-1; rates in the marginal ice zone generally ranged between 5 and 9 nmol N l-1 h-1. Protozoan activity was of predominant importance for the remineralization process; only after the krill event was a very high bacterial activity observed. The presence of krill does not contribute in a direct way to the ammonium pool, but probably initiates the bacterial breakdown activity in algal debris and faecal pellets. The increased remineralization leads to enhanced availability of ammonium in the water and to decreased f-ratios for phytoplanktonic nitrate assimilation. Nevertheless, nitrate uptake represented at least 30% of inorganic nitrogen assimilation, significantly higher than values measured for oligotrophic systems.

The devil is in the detail: small-scale sexual segregation despite large-scale spatial overlap in the wandering albatross	MARINE BIOLOGY												Sexual segregation in foraging habitat occurs in many marine predators and is usually attributed to competitive exclusion, different parental roles of each sex or niche specialisation associated with sexual size dimorphism. However, relatively few studies have attempted to understand the patterns and underlying drivers of local-scale sexual segregation in marine predators. We studied habitat use, diet and feeding ecology of female and male wandering albatrosses Diomedea exulans, fitted with GPS and stomach-temperature loggers during the chick-rearing period( austral winter) at South Georgia in 2009. During this period, when oceanographic conditions were anomalous and prey availability was low in waters near the breeding colony, the tracked wandering albatrosses showed high consistency in their foraging areas at a large spatial scale, and both males and females targeted sub-Antarctic and subtropical waters. Despite consistency in large-scale habitat use, males and females showed different foraging behaviours in response to oceanographic conditions at a smaller scale. Males appeared to be more opportunistic, scavenging for offal or non-target fish discarded by fishing vessels in less productive, oceanic waters. They exhibited sinuous movements, feeding mostly on large prey and consuming similar amounts of food during the outbound and return parts of the foraging trip. In contrast, females targeted natural productivity hotspots, and fed on a wide variety of fish and cephalopods. They commuted directly to these areas; most prey were ingested on the outbound part of the trip, and they often started their return after ingesting large prey at the farthest point from the colony. Together, these results indicate that sexual segregation in core foraging areas of wandering albatrosses is driven by sex-specific habitat selection due to the low availability of prey in local Antarctic waters. This segregation results in different feeding behaviour at local scales which may be explained by differing breeding roles and degree of parental investment by each sex, with females investing more than males in reproduction. Further investigations are necessary to confirm the existence of this pattern through time under contrasting environmental conditions and to identify the drivers responsible for local-scale sexual segregation in wandering albatrosses.

J	Pond, DW				Pond, David W.			The physical properties of lipids and their role in controlling the distribution of zooplankton in the oceans	JOURNAL OF PLANKTON RESEARCH												A new perspective on the role of lipids in zooplankton is proposed, with solidliquid phase transitions of lipids being a factor regulating their buoyancy. These phase transitions are controlled by zooplankton in relation to their physical environment, through the selective accumulation of specific lipids with optimum levels of unsaturation. The necessity to control buoyancy and maintain an optimum depth is a fundamental evolutionary force, driving anatomical, biochemical and behavioural adaptations of all organisms within the aquatic realm. It is hypothesized that each species adjusts the amount, composition and anatomical location of lipids, to maximize fitness according to their preferred habitat and life history traits. Recent discoveries regarding the role of phase transitions of lipids in marine zooplankton and their role in regulating buoyancy will require re-interpretation of existing data and stimulate future scientific endeavours in zooplankton research.																	0142-7873	1464-3774				JUN	2012	34	6					443	453		10.1093/plankt/fbs027							WOS:000303340700001

Thus, we examined the spatial distribution of pelagic cnidarians from the oceanic to neritic zone off Ad,lie Land, East Antarctica. Discrete depth sampling was conducted from the surface to 2,000 m depth from late January to early February 2008. In total, 3347 individuals representing 45 species/taxa from eight orders were collected. Cluster analysis revealed three major clusters: (1) an epipelagic group in the oceanic zone composed mainly of Pegantha martagon, the abundance and species diversity of which were very low; (2) a meso- and bathy-pelagic group characterised by high abundance and species diversity with dominance of Dimophyes arctica, Vogtia serrata, and Halicreas minimum; and (3) a neritic group represented by a high abundance of Diphyes antarctica. Cnidarian communities in the epipelagic zone were divided by hydrographic structures such as the Southern Boundary of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current and Antarctic Slope Front, whereas those in the meso- and bathy-pelagic layers dominated by circumpolar deep water were relatively stable with higher diversity throughout the oceanic zone.

We measured stable isotopes (delta C-13, delta N-15) in blood samples collected during breeding at Bird Island (South Georgia, Antarctica) in 1998 and at 2 colonies in the Argentinean area of Patagonia in 2000 and 2001. Individuals from South Georgia showed lower delta C-13 and 8(15)N values than those in Patagonia, as expected from the more pelagic location and the short length of the Antarctic food web. Males and females showed significant differences in the isotopic signatures at both localities. These differences agree with the sexual differences in diet found in previous studies, which showed that both sexes rely mainly on penguin and seal carrion, but females also feed extensively on marine prey, such as fish, squid and crustaceans. However, males from Patagonia showed significantly higher delta N-15 and delta C-13 values than females did, and the reverse trend was observed at South Georgia. This opposite trend is probably related to the different trophic level of carrion between locations: whereas penguins and pinnipeds in Patagonia rely mainly on fish and cephalopods, in South Georgia they rely mainly on krill. Stable isotope values of male and female chicks in Patagonia did not differ; both attained high values, similar to adult males and higher than adult females, suggesting that parents do not provision their single offspring differently in relation to sex; however, they seem to provide offspring with a higher proportion of carrion, probably of higher quality, and more abundant food, than they consume themselves. Stable isotopes at South Georgia were not affected by age of adults. We have provided new information on intraspecific segregation in the diet in a seabird species and have also underlined the importance of considering food web structure when studying intraspecific variability in trophic ecology.

Modeling the Impact of Ocean Circulation on Chlorophyll Blooms Around South Georgia, Southern Ocean	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS												The northeast periphery of the Scotia Sea hosts one of the largest chlorophyll-a blooms of the Southern Ocean. This bloom peaks to the northwest of the island of South Georgia, extending eastward for hundreds of kilometers. Although the Southern Ocean has many islands of similar size, South Georgia is ecologically one of the most significant: It not only sustains one of the Southern Ocean's largest and most diverse ecosystems but also constitutes its single most important region for biological carbon sequestration. While the exceptional nature of South Georgia's blooms has been recognized widely, both the physical processes that contribute to their fertilization and the reasons why these blooms are larger than those of other similar regions (e.g., Kerguelen or Crozet Islands) are poorly understood. We use the results of a high-resolution ocean model to investigate the physical processes that mediate the entrainment of deep, iron-rich waters into the surface layers of the South Georgia region. We show that the Southern Antarctic Circumpolar Current Front, the southernmost jet of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC), pumps iron-enriched waters from the deep ocean onto the bottom layers of South Georgia's shelf. These waters are upwelled along the northern coast of the island and are then exported into the Georgia Basin, where topographically steered circulation shields them from the dispersive effects of local currents and eddies, thus allowing the bloom development.				combes, vincent/AAA-2343-2020	combes, vincent/0000-0002-0416-1827; Matano, Ricardo/0000-0001-5177-4610; Meredith, Michael/0000-0002-7342-7756												2169-9275	2169-9291				SEP	2020	125	9							e2020JC016391	10.1029/2020JC016391							WOS:000576619900039

Cuttlefish, Sepia officinalis, were given meals of krill slurry (Euphausia superba). Protein extracts of contents from four regions of the digestive tract, stomach, caecum, digestive gland and intestine, were tested for prey antigenicity. Digestion times (loss of antigenicity) ranged from 1 to 8 h depending on sampling site. Stomach and caecum emptied rapidly, but meal antigenicity persisted longer in the digestive gland. The Sepia experiments provide a basis for interpretation of results from natural predation by cephalopods.																	0025-3154	1469-7769				AUG	1992	72	3					543	551		10.1017/S0025315400059336							WOS:A1992JK83000004						
J	ROBY, DD				ROBY, DD			DIET AND POSTNATAL ENERGETICS IN CONVERGENT TAXA OF PLANKTON-FEEDING SEABIRDS	AUK												To evaluate the influence of diet composition on seabird postnatal development, I examined the relationships between feeding rate, energy intake, energy partitioning, and chick growth in three species of high latitude, plankton-feeding seabirds: Least Auklet (Aethia pusilla), South Georgia Diving Petrel (Pelecanoides georgicus), and Common Diving Petrel (P. urinatrix). Average dietary lipid content varied from 22 to 46% of dry mass among the three species. Least Auklet chicks were fed meals rich in wax esters; on average 63% of total energy intake was in the form of wax. Interspecific comparisons of chick dietary composition and energy budgets indicated that calanoid copepods, a wax ester-rich food, was a balanced source of protein and lipids. However, the lipid content of Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) was insufficient to meet maintenance energy requirements of Common Diving Petrels. Lipid-rich diets were associated with shorter brooding periods, higher rates of nestling fat deposition, and larger lipid reserves at fledging. Accumulation rates of lipid-free dry matter were similar in the three species despite differences in energy intake related to diet. The energy cost of growth was a relatively minor component of nestling energy budgets; most assimilated energy was allocated toward maintenance and fat deposition. Selection apparently favors high latitude seabirds that meet the high energy requirements of their chicks by providing a lipid-rich diet. Differences in diet composition explained much of the variation in postnatal development among the three species, but there was no evidence that energy limited growth per se.

J	Ward, P; Shreeve, RS; Cripps, GC				Ward, P; Shreeve, RS; Cripps, GC			Rhincalanus gigas and Calanus simillimus: Lipid storage patterns of two species of copepod in the seasonally ice-free zone of the Southern Ocean	JOURNAL OF PLANKTON RESEARCH												The lipid and hydrocarbon composition of two species of Antarctic copepod, Rhincalanus gigas and Calanus simillimus, was investigated at two contrasting sites. Differences in the quantity of total lipid between sites were pronounced for R. gigas; females from a station near South Georgia where a bloom was in progress contained similar to 8 times as much as those sampled in post-bloom waters in the Polar Frontal Zone (PFZ) some 450 km further north. In contrast, differences between sites for C. simillimus were less pronounced. The main lipid class for R. gigas was wax ester and for C. simillimus triacylglycerol. This fundamental difference is thought to reflect varying life-history patterns suggesting that C. simillimus may not undergo periods of pronounced food shortage. Pristane, a metabolite of phytol derived through the degradation of chlorophyll, was present in both species at both sites, indicating recent feeding activity, but the lack of the polyene diatom marker C-21:6 in C. simillimus at the PFZ station suggested that it was largely feeding on other microplankton. Fatty acid analysis of C. simillimus offered further evidence that this species was omnivorous and that R. gigas was predominantly herbivorous. 16:0 and 16:1 generally accounted for slightly >50% of total fatty acids in both species; however, 16:0 was proportionately more abundant in C. simillimus and 16:1 in R. gigas. The 16:1/16:0 ratio is usually >1 in diatoms, suggesting that the diet of C. simillimus contained items of prey other than diatoms, a fact confirmed in grazing experiments.																	0142-7873					AUG	1996	18	8					1439	1454		10.1093/plankt/18.8.1439							WOS:A1996VE80800012

Population demographics and growth rate of Salpa thompsoni on the Kerguelen Plateau	JOURNAL OF MARINE SYSTEMS												This study aimed to obtain the first estimates of S. thompsoni population dynamics and growth rates over the Kerguelen Plateau (Southern Indian Ocean). Micro nekton, including salps, were repeatedly sampled during late summer to early autumn (26th February - 15th March 2018) at contrasting hydrological stations on the Kerguelen Plateau in the southern proximity of Kerguelen Islands. At two stations, S. thompsoni made up almost half of the micronekton biomass. Environmental conditions were important in determining the density and development of S. thompsoni populations. Growth rates (0.5-7.0% d(-1)) were higher than previously reported from the Antarctic Peninsula (0.3-4.6% d(-1)) but lower than near the Antarctic Polar Front (APF; 3.7-20.7% d(-1)). Despite warm surface waters (4-5 degrees C), low chlorophyll a concentrations restricted the salp populations from growing as fast as populations near the APF. Because the Kerguelen Plateau region deflects a branch of warm water southward towards Antarctica, more studies of S. thompsoni population dynamics across multiple seasons are needed to fully understand their importance over the Kerguelen Plateau and their invasion potential into higher latitudes.

J	Emmerson, L; Southwell, C				Emmerson, Louise; Southwell, Colin			Adelie penguin survival: age structure, temporal variability and environmental influences	OECOLOGIA												The driving factors of survival, a key demographic process, have been particularly challenging to study, especially for winter migratory species such as the Ad,lie penguin (Pygoscelis adeliae). While winter environmental conditions clearly influence Antarctic seabird survival, it has been unclear to which environmental features they are most likely to respond. Here, we examine the influence of environmental fluctuations, broad climatic conditions and the success of the breeding season prior to winter on annual survival of an Ad,lie penguin population using mark-recapture models based on penguin tag and resight data over a 16-year period. This analysis required an extension to the basic Cormack-Jolly-Seber model by incorporating age structure in recapture and survival sub-models. By including model covariates, we show that survival of older penguins is primarily related to the amount and concentration of ice present in their winter foraging grounds. In contrast, fledgling and yearling survival depended on other factors in addition to the physical marine environment and outcomes of the previous breeding season, but we were unable to determine what these were. The relationship between sea-ice and survival differed with penguin age: extensive ice during the return journey to breeding colonies was detrimental to survival for the younger penguins, whereas either too little or too much ice (between 15 and 80% cover) in the winter foraging grounds was detrimental for adults. Our results demonstrate that predictions of Ad,lie penguin survival can be improved by taking into account penguin age, prior breeding conditions and environmental features.																	0029-8549	1432-1939				DEC	2011	167	4					951	965		10.1007/s00442-011-2044-7							WOS:000297133800009	21691857					
J	Poperechna, N; Heumann, KG				Poperechna, N; Heumann, KG			Species-specific GC/ICP-IDMS for trimethyllead determinations in biological and environmental samples	ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY												An accurate and sensitive species-specific isotope dilution GC/ICPMS method was developed for the determination of trimethyllead (Me3Pb+) in biological and environmental samples. A trimethyllead spike was synthesized from Pb-206-enriched metallic lead by reaction of lead halide with methyllithium and subsequent formation of trimethyllead iodide. The isotopic composition of the spike solution was determined by GC/ICPMS after derivatization with tetraethylborate, and its concentration was determined by reverse isotope dilution analysis. The species-specific GC/ICP-IDMS method was validated by reference material CRM 605 (urban dust) certified for Me3Pb+. The method was also applied to determine the Me3Pb+ content in six biological reference materials (DORM 2, CRM 278, CRM 422, CRM 463, CRM 477, MURST-ISS-A2) and one sediment reference material (CRM 580) for which no certified values of this species exist. The Me3Pb+ concentrations in the biological reference materials vary in the range of 0.3-17 ng g(-1) (as Pb) except for the Antarctic Krill (MURST-ISS-A2), where the concentration was less than the detection limit of 0.09 ng g(-1), which was also found for the sediment. Up to 20% of total lead was methylated in the biological reference materials, whereas much higher methylation fractions were found for mercury. The method was also applied to seafood samples purchased from a supermarket with Me3Pb+ concentrations in the limited range of 0.3-0.7 ng g(-1). On the contrary, the portion of methylated lead in these samples varied over more than 2 orders of magnitude from 0.02 to 7.5%.																	0003-2700	1520-6882				JAN 15	2005	77	2					511	516		10.1021/ac048757m							WOS:000226318300019	15649047

The quantification of the autofluorescent age pigment, lipofuscin. has revealed promising results in boreal and tropical species. We studied the presence of morphological lipofuscin and its possible application as an age marker in five Arctic and five Antarctic species. comprising decapods, amphipods and a euphausiid. Lipofuscin granules were located in the brain, using confocal fluorescence microscopy, and quantified from digital images. The pigment was found in 94 of 100 individuals and in all 10 species, and granules occurred in easily detectable amounts in 5 species. Two scavenging amphipod species, the Antarctic Waldeckia obesa and the Arctic Eurythenes gryllus, revealed the most conspicuous and numerous granules. There was a broad, though weak, correlation of lipofuscin concentration with individual body size within a species, but not with absolute body size of one species compared to another. In larvae of the decapod Chorismus antarcticus, lipofuscin accumulation was quantified over the 1st 4 months after larval release. Morphological lipofuscin is a potential index of age in those investigated species with a sufficient accumulation rate of the pigment.

As the dietary nutritional composition is important for optimal performance of H. gammarus, in this study we aimed to investigate whether juvenile growth and energy metabolism responses to temperature variation could be modulated by the diet. Prior to the trial start, the juveniles were divided into two groups. One was maintained at 19 degrees C and the other gradually adapted to 13 degrees C. From this point and for a 24-day period, juveniles (similar to 100 mg) within each temperature group were assigned one of two experimental diets: a carbohydrate-rich (HC) or a protein-rich (HP) extruded feed. Antarctic krill (AK) was used as a control diet within each temperature group. Feed intake, growth, glycogen, glucose, lactate, and protein concentrations of H. gammarus in each group were evaluated. Regardless the dietary treatment, feed intake, cephalothorax protein and glucose, and abdominal glycogen and glucose levels decreased at colder temperature. The effect of lower temperature on growth (SGR and moulting rate declines) and energy metabolism (reduction on cephalothorax glycogen and protein) was more severe in HC-fed lobsters. Results showed that the impact of lower temperature on juvenile H. gammarus can be modulated by diet highlighting the importance of designing optimized diets not only for growth and feed efficiency but also for resilience to environmental variation.

J	Gorska, N; Chu, D				Gorska, N; Chu, D			Some aspects of sound extinction by zooplankton	JOURNAL OF THE ACOUSTICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA												To address the importance of sound extinction (or the shadowing effect) in the presence of a densely aggregated zooplankton layer, acoustic scattering by weakly scattering fluid objects is studied theoretically. An analytical expression for the extinction cross section is obtained based on the forward scattering theorem and the analytical formula for the forward scattering amplitude is derived from the Modal Based-Deformed Cylinder Model (MB-DCM). The validity of the MB-DCM solution for the forward scattering amplitude and its sensitivity to geometrical and physical parameters is studied. Comparison with the PC-DV;BA (Phase-Compensated-Distorted Wave Born Approximation) shows a reasonable agreement between the two models. The extinction cross section is shown to be proportional to (ka)(2) and the induced attenuation is predicted for various species of zooplankton over a wide frequency range. It is shown that, under certain realistic conditions, such as the presence of a swarm of aggregated krill, sound extinction by zooplankton could influence the acoustic measurements significantly, as much as an 85% reduction in acoustic intensity for Euphausia superba with n = 5000 ind./m(3) over a range of 50 m.

J	Liva, M; Munoz-Olivas, R; Camara, C				Liva, M; Munoz-Olivas, R; Camara, C			Determination of Cd in sonicate slurries and leachates of biological and environmental materials by FI-CV-AAS	TALANTA												An analytical method for Cd analysis in solid samples which combines the ultrasonic slurry formation with cold vapour generation and atomic absorption spectrometry is described. The samples are suspended in HCl and sonicated until homogeneous and reduced particle size slurry formation. Several aspects were studied: acidity of the medium, sonication time, and slurry formation in different matrices. The procedure described permits the use of direct calibration, with KCN addition as masking agent of interfering ions (Cu, Pb, Ni and Zn) present in the environmental matrices. Supernatant analysis of these last samples experimentally shown that preparation of the suspension with 6 mol l(-1) HCl concentration led to quantitative extraction of Cd. Biological materials analysis needed the use of the standard addition calibration method due to the high matrix effect observed. Supernatant analysis in biological samples does not give a total Cd recovery for all of them. The detection limits observed for Cd were 0.05 and 0.2 mu g l(-1) for supernatant and slurry analysis respectively in environmental samples, while in biological samples were 0.2 and 0.6 mu g l(-1) for supernatant and slurry analysis, respectively. In all case the better precision was obtained for supernatant analysis (3-6%) than slurry analysis (6-12%). The results obtained by analysing different reference materials (sewage sludge, city waste incineration, Antarctic krill and human hair) showed good agreement with the certified value confirming the validity of such a method for Cd determination instead to wet digestion procedures.

Diving patterns of female macaroni penguins breeding on Marion Island, South Africa	POLAR BIOLOGY												Despite the large biomass of macaroni penguins Eudyptes chrysolophus in the Southern Ocean, their feeding ecology is poorly known at some important breeding localities. We investigated the diving behaviour and diet of female macaroni penguins feeding small chicks on Marion Island (46A(0)52'S, 37A(0)5'E), South Africa, one of the species' most northerly breeding sites, supporting 4% of their global population. We then compared our results with similar studies from other localities. In December 2008, we collected information on 12 foraging trips from 6 individuals using time-depth recorders, as well as diet from 42 individuals. Median trip duration was 22.8 h (5.6-80.8 h). Penguins performed 42.8 +/- A 15.9 dives per hour at sea, with dive depths averaging 24.6 +/- A 8.6 m and lasting 40.8 +/- A 12.1 s, although 74.3% of dives were < 10 m. Euphasids dominated their diet (86% by mass), mainly Thysanoessa vicina. A second peak in dive depths at 55-80 m might reflect the 12% of fish in their diet. The substantial proportion of shallow night dives (30% of total dives) suggests some foraging occurs at night. Differences in diving patterns of individual macaroni penguins in this study confirmed the behavioural flexibility of these birds reported from other breeding localities. However, most other studies assumed that dives < 3-5 m were commuting dives whereas our study suggests that at least some prey are caught during shallow dives. We highlight how different analytical methods can change the outcome of studies. Despite macaroni penguins' apparent flexibility in foraging behaviour during the breeding season, their numbers are decreasing globally. Further investigations of their foraging behaviour are needed to assess potential competition with other predators and krill fisheries.

J	Ratcliffe, N; Adlard, S; Stowasser, G; McGill, R				Ratcliffe, Norman; Adlard, Stacey; Stowasser, Gabrielle; McGill, Rona			Dietary divergence is associated with increased intra-specific competition in a marine predator	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS												Optimal foraging theory predicts that when food is plentiful all individuals should take a small range of preferred prey types, but as competition increases less preferred prey will be included in the diet. This dietary switching may not be uniform among individuals, which produces discrete dietary clusters. We tested this hypothesis for gentoo penguins at Bird Island, South Georgia, using stable isotope analysis and biologging. Competition, in the form of the density of foraging dives, increased markedly from incubation to chick-rearing owing to increased foraging effort. Birds responded behaviourally by exploiting a greater portion of the available foraging radius and increasing dive depths. Dietary niche width doubled and two discrete dietary clusters appeared; one comprising birds that consumed mostly krill and another that ate a greater proportion of demersal fish. There were no differences in morphology between the dietary classes, but birds in the fish class had a tendency to dive deeper, which suggests a behavioural basis for specialization. Our findings are consistent with the hypothesis that intra-specific competition expands the population's dietary niche width and drives divergence in diets among individuals.

We used GIS-based modelling at a scale of 0.5 x 0.5 degrees spatial cells to: (1) map the foraging distribution of seabirds; (2) predict their annual food consumption rates in a spatially explicit manner; and (3) estimate a spatially explicit seabird -fisheries overlap index. Information on population size, diet composition and foraging attributes of 351 seabird species was compiled into a Microsoft Access database. Global annual food consumption by seabirds was estimated to be 96.4 million tonnes (95 % CI: 78.0 to 114.7 million tonnes), compared with a total catch of nearly 120 million tonnes by all marine fisheries. Krill and cephalopods comprised over 58 % of the overall food consumed and fish most of the remainder. The families Procellariidae (albatrosses, petrels, shearwaters) and Spheniscidae (penguins) were responsible for over 54 % of the overall food consumption. Seabird foraging distribution maps revealed that areas around New Zealand, the eastern Australian coast, and the sub-Antarctic islands had high species richness. However, temperate and polar regions supported high seabird densities and most food extracted by seabirds originated there. Furthermore, maps of food consumption rates revealed that most food consumed by seabirds was extracted from offshore rather than nearshore waters and from areas where seabird -fisheries overlap was low. The resource overlap maps identified 'hotspots' of highest potential for conflict between fisheries and seabirds. Thus, this study may provide useful insight when developing management approaches for designing offshore marine conservation areas.

J	Jansen, JK; Boveng, PL; Bengtson, JL				Jansen, JK; Boveng, PL; Bengtson, JL			Foraging modes of chinstrap penguins: contrasts between day and night	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												Penguins rely on vision to travel and hunt at sea. Vision in marine predators, particularly those hunting phototactic prey under a broad range of light intensities, must be better understood to realize how these species respond to changes in their environment. We studied the effects of daily cycles in light intensity on visual predators by examining the duration and timing of chinstrap penguins' Pygoscelis antarctica foraging trips and the size, composition, and timing of their meals. We used radio telemetry and stomach-contents sampling to study adult penguins that were provisioning chicks during the summers of 1993 and 1994 at Seal Island, Antarctica. The penguins rarely initiated or terminated foraging trips at night, but otherwise varied the timing and duration of trips to sea. Cluster analyses using departure and arrival times revealed 5 distinct modes of foraging: 3 were strictly diurnal (early, mid-, and late) and 2 were partly nocturnal (overnight and extended). Durations of diurnal trips (4 to 11 h) were shorter than overnight (13 to 14 h) and extended trips (18 to 22 h). Early and mid-diurnal trips and extended trips were significantly shorter in 1993 than in 1994; late diurnal and overnight trip durations did not differ between years. Diurnal foraging was most common in 1993, whereas overnight foraging predominated in 1994. Shortened diurnal foraging in 1993 appears to have increased the frequency of diurnal foraging by allowing more parent birds to alternate diurnal trips within a single day and by reducing the incidence of birds extending diurnal foraging through the night. That penguins foraged more frequently by day when permitted by shorter trip durations tin 1993) suggests that they opted to forage diurnally whenever possible. Returning diurnal and overnight foragers had greater than 99 and 74% Antarctic krill Euphausia superba by weight in their stomachs, respectively. However, overnight foragers also returned with significant amounts of highly digested remains of pelagic fish, suggesting birds were in offshore waters taking fish during the night. In contrast, only 1 out of 40 diurnal foragers from both years combined had evidence of fish. Thus, the daily light cycle affected both the timing and duration of chinstrap penguin foraging as well as the type of prey consumed during trips to sea.																	0171-8630						1998	165						161	172		10.3354/meps165161							WOS:000073828700014

The under ice assemblage was characterized by low biomass and dominated by small species (Salpingella and Codonellopsis); the ice edge stations were dominated by these same taxa but in higher abundances while the open water assemblage was characterized by high biomass and dominated by Cymatocylis, the largest taxa. All taxa exhibited maximum concentrations in the upper 50m of the water column. Both krill and salps grazed upon the Cymatocylis and Codonellopsis without preference in both the ice covered and open water regimes.																	0954-1020					MAR	1992	4	1					3	8		10.1017/S0954102092000038							WOS:A1992HH55300003						
J	Wu, SY; Hou, S				Wu, Shuang-Ye; Hou, Shugui			Impact of icebergs on net primary productivity in the Southern Ocean	CRYOSPHERE												Productivity in the Southern Ocean (SO) is ironlimited, and supply of iron dissolved from aeolian dust is believed to be the main source from outside the marine environment. However, recent studies show that icebergs could provide a comparable amount of bioavailable iron to the SO as aeolian dust. In addition, small-scale areal studies suggest increased concentrations of chlorophyll, krill, and seabirds surrounding icebergs. Based on previous research, this study aims to examine whether iceberg occurrence has a significant impact on marine productivity at the scale of the SO, using remote sensing data of iceberg occurrences and ocean net primary productivity (NPP) covering the period 2002-2014. The impacts of both large and small icebergs are examined in four major ecological zones of the SO: the continental shelf zone (CSZ), the seasonal ice zone (SIZ), the permanent open ocean zone (POOZ), and the polar front zone (PFZ). We found that the presence of icebergs is associated with elevated levels of NPP, but the differences vary in different zones. Grid cells with small icebergs on average have higher NPP than other cells in most iron-deficient zones: 21% higher for the SIZ, 16% for the POOZ, and 12% for the PFZ. The difference is relatively small in the CSZ where iron is supplied from meltwater and sediment input from the continent. In addition, NPP of grid cells adjacent to large icebergs on average is 10% higher than that of control cells in the vicinity. The difference is larger at higher latitudes, where most large icebergs are concentrated. From 1992 to 2014, there is a significant increasing trend for both small and large icebergs. The increase was most rapid in the early 2000s and has leveled off since then. As the climate continues to warm, the Antarctic Ice Sheet is expected to experience increased mass loss as a whole, which could lead to more icebergs in the region. Based on our study, this could result in a higher level of NPP in the SO as a whole, providing a possible negative feedback for global warming in near future.

J	Zhou, M; Zhu, YW; Peterson, JO				Zhou, M; Zhu, YW; Peterson, JO			In situ growth and mortality of mesozooplankton during the austral fall and winter in Marguerite Bay and its vicinity	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY												Zooplankton play a critical role in the austral winter ecosystem of the Southern Ocean, transporting biomass from lower to higher trophic level organisms through their consumption and growth, and ultimately determining the survival of marine animals such as sea birds and mammals. Previous studies have provided evidence that krill utilize zooplankton through austral winter when the primary production is negligible. Though they are different, all survival strategies produce the same result, a decrease in total zooplankton biomass. It is difficult to examine the total zooplankton biomass balance and process rates from traditional net tow samples because of the spatial variation in zooplankton distribution and the lack of applicable mathematical methods to estimate population process rates. This study focuses on short-term (overnight) loss rates of mesozooplankton associated with adult krill grazing in austral fall and the long-term (winter) body growth and removal rates of mesozooplankton in austral winter based on measurements of zooplankton size structures obtained using an Optical Plankton Counter (OPC) mounted on a Multiple Opening and Closing Nets and Environmental Sensing System (MOCNESS). In order to target an adult Euphausia superba aggregation for a short period, a 153 kHz Vessel-Mounted (VM) Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP) was used for the acoustic backscattering. The in situ process rates of growth and mortality are estimated based on the biomass balance and biomass spectrum theory. The overnight in situ grazing by adult E. superba on mesozooplankton is examined based on the in situ measurements of mesozooplankton biovolume within the water where an adult E. superba aggregation remained during a short study period in late April. The measurements show that approximately 16% of the existing mesozooplankton biovolume was removed in 4 h, which leads to an average specific daily grazing rate of 0.96 day(-1) assuming a daily feeding period of 16 h from dusk to dawn. From the amount of biovolume removed and the abundance of adult euphausiids of approximately 3 individuals m(-3) estimated from the volume backscattering strength and the size of adult euphausiids, the daily ration for an adult euphausiid is approximately equal to 7% body biovolume or biomass day(-1). The total mesozooplankton biovolume decreased at a specific rate of 0.017 day(-1) over the austral winter 2002, while the specific individual body growth was approximately 0.045 day(-1). The sum of these two rates leads to the specific mortality rate equal to approximately 0.07 day(-1) for the winter. These rates lead to a system efficiency of 67% for recycling the biomass during the winter. The measurements indicate that approximately 90% of biovolume (biomass) was removed in the period between the fall cruise in April-May and the winter cruise in August-September 2002.

This is particularly true in polar regions, where sea ice (a sensitive climate variable) plays a crucial yet highly dynamic and variable role in how it influences the whole marine ecosystem, from phytoplankton to top predators. For mesopredators such as seals, sea ice both supports a rich (under-ice) food resource, access to which depends on local to regional coverage and conditions. Here, we investigate sex-specific relationships between the foraging strategies of southern elephant seals (Mirounga leonine) in winter and spatio-temporal variability in sea ice concentration (SIC) and coverage in East Antarctica. We satellite-tracked 46 individuals undertaking post-moult trips in winter from Kerguelen Islands to the peri-Antarctic shelf between 2004 and 2014. These data indicate distinct general patterns of sea ice usage: while females tended to follow the sea ice edge as it extended northward, the males remained on the continental shelf despite increasing sea ice. Seal hunting time, a proxy of foraging activity inferred from the diving behaviour, was longer for females in late autumn in the outer part of the pack ice, similar to 150-370 km south of the ice edge. Within persistent regions of compact sea ice, females had a longer foraging activity (1) in the highest sea ice concentration at their position, but (ii) their foraging activity was longer when there were more patches of low concentration sea ice around their position (either in time or in space; 30 days & 50 kin). The high spatio-temporal variability of sea ice around female positions is probably a key factor allowing them to exploit these concentrated patches. Despite lack of information on prey availability, females may exploit mesopelagic finfishes and squids that concentrate near the ice-water interface or within the water column (from diurnal vertical migration) in the pack ice region, likely attracted by an ice algal autumn bloom that sustains an under-ice ecosystem. In contrast, male foraging effort increased when they remained deep within the sea ice (420-960 km from the ice edge) over the shelf. Males had a longer foraging activity (i) in the lowest sea ice concentration at their position, and (ii) when there were more patches of low concentration sea ice around their position (either in time or in space; 30 days & 50 km) presumably in polynyas or flaw leads between land fast and pack ice. This provides access to zones of enhanced resources in autumn or in early spring such as polynyas, the Antarctic shelf and slope. Our results suggest that some seals utilized a highly sea ice covered environment, which is key for their foraging effort, sustaining or concentrating resources during winter. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Smetacek, V; Assmy, P; Henjes, J				Smetacek, V; Assmy, P; Henjes, J			The role of grazing in structuring Southern Ocean pelagic ecosystems and biogeochemical cycles	ANTARCTIC SCIENCE												This review examines the links between pelagic ecology and ocean biogeochemistry with an emphasis on the role of the Southern Ocean in global cycling of carbon and silica. The structure and functioning of pelagic ecosystems is determined by the relationship between growth and mortality of its species populations. Whereas the key role of iron supply in conditioning the growth environment of land-remote oceans is now emerging, the factors shaping the mortality environment are still poorly understood. This paper addresses the role of grazing as a selective force operating on the structure and functioning of pelagic ecosystems within the larger conceptual framework of evolutionary ecology. That mortality due to grazing decreases with increasing cell size is widely taken for granted. We examine the impact of this principle across the range of size classes occupied by Southern Ocean plankton and show that relatively few species play crucial roles in the trophic structure and biogeochemical cycles of the Southern Ocean. Under iron-sufficient conditions, high growth rates of weakly silicified diatoms and Phaeocystis result in build-up of blooms that fuel "the food chain of the giants" (diatoms-krill-whales) and drive the carbon pump. In contrast, high grazing pressure of small copepods and salps on the regenerating microbial communities characteristic of the iron-limited Southern Ocean results in accumulation of large, heavily silicified diatoms that drive the silicon pump. The hypotheses we derive from field observations can be tested with in situ iron fertilization experiments.

J	DITTRICH, B				DITTRICH, B			THERMAL-ACCLIMATION AND KINETICS OF A TRYPSIN-LIKE PROTEASE IN EUCARID CRUSTACEANS	JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE PHYSIOLOGY B-BIOCHEMICAL SYSTEMIC AND ENVIRONMENTAL PHYSIOLOGY												The properties of a trypsin-like protease in homogenates from midgut glands and gastric fluids of crustaceans were analyzed with special emphasis on thermal acclimation. For comparison, four species from different climatic regions were investigated: Ocypode ryderi (tropical), Cancer pagurus (temperate), Meganyctiphanes norvegica (subarctic-boreal), and Chorismus antarcticus (Antarctic). The pH optimum of the hydrolysis of N-benzoyl-L-arginine-p-nitroanilide is similar in all four species; at 25-degrees-C it ranged between pH 8 and 9.5. In the gastric fluids, pH was between 6.4 (Chorismus) and 7.7 (Ocypode); under experimental conditions at 25-degrees-C, between 25% (Chorismus) and 95% (Ocypode) of maximal activity were observed at these pH values. Temperature optima of protease activity are independent from mean ambient temperature and were found to be around 50-degrees-C in Ocypode, 45-degrees-C in Cancer, 50-55-degrees-C in Meganycliphanes, and 40-degrees-C in Chorismus. At temperatures near 0-degrees-C, temperate and tropical species show either a very low or even no activity at all, whereas the Antarctic and subarctic-boreal species display a residual activity of up to 15% of maximum activity. Under natural conditions, approximately 50% of maximal available enzymatic activity are eventually utilized. The kinetic parameters V(max) and K(m) depend on temperature and show distinct differences between the species. As an immediate response to temperature changes, the affinity for substrate decreases with elevated temperatures. Cold adaptation implies an effective utilization of energy in a low-energy system; the most prominent means of adaptation to low temperatures is the reduction of activation energy. Energies of activation in tropical temperate, and subarctic-boreal species (23.3-31.5 kJ . mol-1) are significantly higher than in the Antarctic species (11.9-13.6 kJ . mol-1). The enzymes were inhibited by N-tosyl-L-lysine chloromethyl ketone, copper sulfate, mercury chloride, and silver nitrate. In all enzymes, soybean trypsin inhibitor was the most effective inhibitor. Activation occurred after application of bovine serum albumin or calcium and magnesium chloride. The species-specific reactions after application of different protein or salt solutions support the hypothesis of decisive differences at the molecular level.																	0174-1578					JAN	1992	162	1					38	46									WOS:A1992HB81800006						
J	Lovvorn, JR				Lovvorn, James R.			Modeling profitability for the smallest marine endotherms: auklets foraging within pelagic prey patches	AQUATIC BIOLOGY												Auklets (Alcidae) can be very abundant in north-temperate to arctic seas. Their numbers and trophic impacts in a given area depend on their ability to forage profitably as a function of the dispersion, depth, and density of prey patches. Thus, modeling these relationships is important when predicting the auklets' response to environmental change. This paper presents a simulation model of the foraging costs and intake rates of Cassin's auklets Ptychoramphus aleuticus (similar to 170 g) and least auklets Aethia pusilla (similar to 80 g) once they have located a patch of zooplankton prey. In the model, water temperature and dive depth (max. 20 m) have important effects on dive costs, mainly by affecting the duration and magnitude of costs during passive ascent. Within a prey patch, modeled intake rates are limited at relatively low prey densities by pursuit and handling time after a prey item is detected. Because intake rate is limited by capture time and not prey visibility, the model indicates that changes in light conditions over these depths have little direct effect on intake rates of zooplankton prey. However, vertical migration of prey in response to diel light cycles can strongly affect profitability (energy gain minus cost) by altering the depth of dives to prey patches. Because pursuit and handling time limit modeled intake rate, profitability cannot be increased further by finding patches of higher density, but rather by extending time in patches by swimming farther or slower. The model suggests that auklet dispersion should be insensitive to variations in patch density above a threshold that is relatively low compared to the very high densities that can occur. However, auklets may be attracted to higher-density patches because the patches themselves are more visible or predictable, or because other predators from seabirds to whales-may gather in such patches and increase their visibility.

Association between Blood Omega-3 Index and Cognition in Typically Developing Dutch Adolescents	NUTRIENTS												The impact of omega-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFAs) on cognition is heavily debated. In the current study, the possible association between omega-3 LCPUFAs in blood and cognitive performance of 266 typically developing adolescents aged 13-15 years is investigated. Baseline data from Food2Learn, a double-blind and randomized placebo controlled krill oil supplementation trial in typically developing adolescents, were used for the current study. The Omega-3 Index was determined with blood from a finger prick. At baseline, participants finished a neuropsychological test battery consisting of the Letter Digit Substitution Test (LDST), D2 test of attention, Digit Span Forward and Backward, Concept Shifting Test and Stroop test. Data were analyzed with multiple regression analyses with correction for covariates. The average Omega-3 Index was 3.83% (SD 0.60). Regression analyses between the Omega-3 Index and the outcome parameters revealed significant associations with scores on two of the nine parameters. The association between the Omega-3 Index and both scores on the LDST (beta = 0.136 and p = 0.039), and the number of errors of omission on the D2 (beta = -0.053 and p = 0.007). This is a possible indication for a higher information processing speed and less impulsivity in those with a higher Omega-3 Index.

Like other forms of particulate organic carbon (POC), they can be remineralized in the ocean interior (particularly in the upper 200 m), or alternatively they can be preserved in the sediments. The controls on the attenuation of FP flux with depth are not fully understood, in particular, the relative contributions of zooplankton fragmentation and microbial/zooplankton respiration to FP loss. Collection of sinking particles using Marine Snow Catchers at three ecologically contrasting sites in the Scotia Sea, Antarctica, revealed large differences in POC flux composition (5-96% FP) and flux attenuation despite similar temperatures. To determine the importance of microbial respiration on FP loss in the upper mesopelagic, we made the first ever measurements of small scale oxygen gradients through the boundary layer at the interface of krill FP collected from the Scotia Sea. Estimated carbon-specific respiration rates of microbes within FP (0.010-0.065 d(-1)) were too low to account for the observed large decreases in FP flux over the upper 200 m. Therefore, the observed rapid declines in downward FP flux in the upper mesopelagic are more likely to be caused by zooplankton, through coprophagy, coprorhexy, and coprochaly. Microbial respiration is likely to be more important in regions of higher temperatures, and at times of the year, or in depths of the ocean, where zooplankton abundances are low and therefore grazing and fragmentation processes are reduced.

In the Antarctic, the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR) is responsible for this task, and currently Germany leads a corresponding scientific evaluation of the wider Weddell Sea region. Compared to other marine regions within the Southern Ocean, the Weddell Sea is exceptionally well investigated. A tremendous amount of data and information has been produced over the last 4 decades. Here, we give a systematic overview of all data sources collected in the context of the Weddell Sea MPA planning process. The compilation of data sources is comprised of data produced by scientists and institutions from more than 20 countries that were either available within our institutes, downloaded via data portals or transcribed from the literature. It is the first compilation for this area that includes abiotic data, such as bathymetry and sea ice, and ecological data from zooplankton, zoobenthos, fish, birds and marine mammals. All data layer products based on this huge compilation of environmental and ecological data are available from the data publisher PANGAEA via the six persistent identifiers at https://doi.org/10.1594/PANGAEA.899595 (Pehlke and Teschke, 2019), https://doi.org/10.1594/PANGAEA.899667 (Teschke et al., 2019a), https://doi.org/10.1594/PANGAEA.899645 (Teschke et al., 2019b), https://doi.org/10.1594/PANGAEA.899591 (Teschke et al., 2019c), https://doi.org/10.1594/PANGAEA.899520 (Pehlke et al., 2019a) and https://doi.org/10.1594/PANGAEA.899619 (Pehlke et al., 2019b).

Although, bulk acoustic data can provide information on the distribution patterns and dynamics of MTL organisms, it is necessary to convert acoustic-derived indices into biologically relevant quantities for parameterising and validating ecosystem and trophic models. A 7-year time series of acoustic data collected by ships of opportunity (SOOP) in the New Zealand sector of the Southern Ocean, information on species' distribution derived from trawl samples collected in research voyages, and target strength (TS) estimates obtained using a resonance-scattering model and literature TS-length relationships, were used to obtain the first estimates of density of mesopelagic fish in this region. Estimates of mesopelagic fish density decreased from north to south reflecting changes in species composition and scattering properties across three latitudinal regions (Northern, Central and Southern). Density estimates ranged from 16.4-40.1 in the north to 4.4-13.4 g m(-2) in the south. Catches revealed that the Northern region was dominated by Lampanyctodes hectoris and Protomyctophum sp. (Myctophidae) and Maurolicus australis (Sternoptychidae); the Central and Southern regions were dominated by the myctophids Electrona antarctica and Protomyctophum sp. and the Antarctic krill, Euphausia superba. Information on species composition was the main source of uncertainty in the density estimates, highlighting the need for more biological sampling. This study demonstrates that it is possible to integrate acoustic data collected opportunistically with auxiliary information from research voyages and literature to provide estimates of mesopelagic fish biomass in remote areas.					ladroit, Yoann/0000-0002-5723-9501												0722-4060	1432-2056				JAN	2020	43	1					43	61		10.1007/s00300-019-02611-3							WOS:000511739000004

Total lipid per digestive gland decreased significantly during starvation compared to Day 0 individuals, falling from 1960 (+/-172) to 385 (+/-81) mu g. Polar lipid was the major lipid class utilised during starvation, falling from 1510 (+/-225) to 177 (+/-46) mu g per digestive gland (76 to 45%). Absolute levels of triacylglycerol fell from 300 (+/-41) to 76 (+/-5) mu g; however, relative levels remained unchanged. The relative level of free fatty acid increased significantly with starvation (4 to 39%) with absolute levels ranging from 79 (+/-1) to 156 (+/-20) mu g per digestive gland. Absolute levels of all fatty acids per digestive gland declined continually until the end of the starvation period. The long-chain polyunsaturated acids eicosapentaenoic (20:5 omega 3) and docosahexaenoic (22:6 omega 3), decreased with starvation from 37 to 26% and 15 to 10%, respectively whereas the saturated fatty acid, palmitic acid (16:0), increased from 15 to 22%. Cholesterol, the major sterol in this organ, increased from 17 (+/-20) to 44 (+/-13) mu g per digestive gland by Day 3, and by Day 19 had returned to levels found in the digestive gland of Day 0 individuals. Desmosterol followed a similar pattern to cholesterol, increasing from 3 (+/-1) mu g per digestive gland on Day 0 to 11 (+/-4) mu g on Day 3, and falling to 2 (+/-1) mu g on Day 19. Other sterols in the digestive gland, predominantly of algal origin, fell from the levels found in Day 0 individuals to near zero amounts by Day 6. The digestive gland of E. superba plays a dynamic role during shortterm starvation in terms of lipid content and composition. The relative levels of polar lipids, free fatty acids and cholesterol in the digestive gland may provide reliable indices of the nutritional condition of E. superba in the field. Sterols in the digestive gland are indicative of recent dietary composition of krill, and may also be used to quantify dietary input from individual phytoplanktonic species.

First, we have estimated the primary production needed to sustain the carbon requirements of the endotherm top predators in the ecosystem. Estimation of the carbon requirements for crabeater seals of about 7 Mtonne C year(-1) is extrapolated to a value for all endotherm predators of 15-30 Mtonne C year(-1). Current data indicate that 70-80% of the diet of this suite of predators is zooplankton (predominantly the euphausiid krill), making for highly efficient transfer from primary production to top predators. Our best estimate of Southern Ocean primary production by this method is of the order of 1.7 Gtonne C year(-1), or an averaged areal primary production of about 30-40 g C m(-2) year(-1). Our second approach is to estimate primary production from the drawdown of inorganic nutrients, based on the Limited suite of studies from which an annual nutrient deficit can be calculated. Again, this indicates annual primary production of the order of 1.5 Gtonne. Although both methods have inherent uncertainties, taken together they provide a relatively robust constraint on annual primary production. For both methods to underestimate primary production by the 1-1.5 Gtonne C implied by the higher current estimates, carbon export from the Southern Ocean pelagic ecosystem would need to be much higher than is normally found in other oceans.																	0924-7963					NOV	1998	17	1-4					275	288		10.1016/S0924-7963(98)00043-8							WOS:000077463500019

Near-bottom zooplankton aggregations in Kongsfjorden: implications for pelago-benthic coupling	POLAR BIOLOGY												Near-bottom zooplankton communities have rarely been studied despite numerous reports of high zooplankton concentrations, probably due to methodological constraints. In Kongsfjorden, Svalbard, the near-bottom layer was studied for the first time by combining daytime deployments of a remotely operated vehicle (ROV), the optical zooplankton sensor moored on-sight key species investigation (MOKI), and Tucker trawl sampling. ROV data from the fjord entrance and the inner fjord showed high near-bottom abundances of euphausiids with a mean concentration of 17.3 +/- 3.5 n x 100 m(-3). With the MOKI system, we observed varying numbers of euphausiids, amphipods, chaetognaths, and copepods on the seafloor at six stations. Light-induced zooplankton swarms reached densities in the order of 90,000 (euphausiids), 120,000 (amphipods), and 470,000 ind m(-3) (chaetognaths), whereas older copepodids of Calanus hyperboreus and C. glacialis did not respond to light. They were abundant at the seafloor and 5 and 15 m above and showed maximum abundance of 65,000 ind m(-3). Tucker trawl data provided an overview of the seasonal vertical distribution of euphausiids. The most abundant species Thysanoessa inermis reached near-bottom concentrations of 270 ind m(-3). Regional distribution was neither related to depth nor to location in the fjord. The taxa observed were all part of the pelagic community. Our observations suggest the presence of near-bottom macrozooplankton also in other regions and challenge the current view of bentho-pelagic coupling. Neglecting this community may cause severe underestimates of the stock of pelagic zooplankton, especially predatory species, which link secondary production with higher trophic levels.

The voyages by the Umitaka-maru have mainly targeted three areas in the Indian Ocean sector: off Dumont d'Urville Base (France, 140 E transect), off Casey Station (Australia, 110 E transect), and off Syowa Station (Japan, north of Lutzow Holm Bay). The findings of Umitaka-maru's research on the krill-independent food web, animal assemblages, community structure and distribution patterns from the epipelagic to the deeper waters provide invaluable information for elucidating the material cycle and predicting future ecosystem changes. Further studies on assessing the influence of sea ice on food webs in the water column are required, which will provide crucial information for predicting ecosystem changes as a result of projected sea ice changes in the near future.

Southern Ocean mesopelagic fish communities in the Scotia Sea are sustained by mass immigration	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												The biomass of mesopelagic fish in the Southern Ocean is one of the largest of any ocean region and is dominated (both in terms of diversity and biomass) by myctophids (lantern-fish). Despite their high ecological importance both in this region and globally, our understanding of the life cycles and distribution of myctophids remains limited. We examined length-frequency data from trawl nets collected across a major sector of the Southern Ocean (the Scotia-Weddell sector) in different seasons to determine patterns of recruitment and growth. There was an absence of larval myctophids, of any species, in net catches, while larger, older individuals became increasingly dominant with increasing latitude. Very few specimens were found to contain mature gonads, indicating that individuals do not reach reproductive condition in this region. Most myctophid species that occurred within the survey regions neither recruited locally nor were self-supporting. Myctophids are prey to a large number of higher predators (penguins, seals and cetaceans) in the Scotia Sea, and are a major predator of zooplankton and krill. We show that this vital part of the Southern Ocean food-web is dependent on mass immigration from lower latitudes in the region. By implication, the sensitivities of this system depend not only on local conditions but also on levels of connectivity to other oceanic regions.

Acoustic surveys of euphausiids and models of baleen whale distribution in the Barents Sea	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												As in many high-latitude ecosystems, euphausiids (order Euphausiacea, 'krill') play a key role in the Barents Sea by channeling energy from primary producers to fish and other zooplankton predators. We used multifrequency acoustic data from several recent multidisciplinary surveys to describe the spatial distribution of backscatter likely to be from euphausiids. Spatial patterns in euphausiid backscatter observed in 2010, 2011, and 2012 were correlated with vertically integrated euphausiid biomass collected with plankton nets, and were also broadly consistent with the distribution of euphausiids expected from the literature. We used the high-resolution and broad-spatial coverage of our euphausiid backscatter data to update multiple regression models of baleen (fin, humpback, and minke) whale distribution to test the hypothesis that these animals aggregated where euphausiids were abundant. After controlling for physical environmental factors and the densities of capelin and several other potential prey taxa, we found that fin whale densities were positively and linearly associated with euphausiid backscatter, and higher than average densities of humpback whales were found in areas with high euphausiid back scatter. No association was found between minke whales and euphausiids. Densities of all 3 whale species were also positively associated with capelin. For fin and humpback whales, the effects of capelin and euphausiids on whale densities appeared to be principally separate and additive, although there was some evidence for a stronger effect of euphausiids at low capelin densities. In terms of their preference for euphausiids and capelin, these whale species appeared to be flexible, opportunistic predators.

Age composition and feeding ecology of early juvenile Notothenia rossii (Pisces, Nototheniidae) at Potter Cove, South Shetland Islands, Antarctica	ANTARCTIC SCIENCE												Age and diet of 140 brown phase early juvenile Notothenia rossii specimens caught at Potter Cove from December 2005-March 2006 were studied. Fish were immature, in the range 8.5-21 cm TL and of age groups 1-2 (otolith/scale readings). The diet (F% and coefficient Q methods) was mainly benthic-demersal organisms with Gammaridean amphipods (primarily Gondogeneia antarctica) as the most frequent (F% = 98) and main prey (Q% = 97). The occurrence of algae, gastropods and harpacticoid copepods was high, but these organisms were secondary or occasional food. The importance of other benthic (bivalves, polychaetes, isopods) and pelagic (ostracods, calanoids, hyperiid amphipods, krill) prey was very low. Preference of larger fish for larger prey was evident. Stomach fullness analysis showed high food availability during the sampling period. Young stages of N. rossii are demersal, preying mainly on gammarideans and other invertebrates of the benthic community associated with macroalgae beds. The almost complete lack of plankton components in the diet of early juvenile fish suggests they do not migrate vertically to feed.																	0954-1020	1365-2079				AUG	2008	20	4					339	341		10.1017/S0954102008000953							WOS:000257842500004						
J	Emmerson, L; Pike, R; Southwell, C				Emmerson, Louise; Pike, Rhonda; Southwell, Colin			Reproductive consequences of environment-driven variation in Adelie penguin breeding phenology	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												Adelie penguins Pygoscelis adeliae exhibit phenological variability across their geographic range due to fixed and variable forcing factors acting differentially on populations. Shifts in breeding phenology can be indicative of environmental change when cues for breeding initiation are tightly linked with environmental conditions. Adelie penguins on opposite sides of Antarctica display contrasting trends in clutch initiation dates, with different explanations of underlying causes. To make comparisons possible with a third significant Adelie penguin population region, we examined temporal trends and driving factors of breeding phenology at Bechervaise Island in East Antarctica. We have extended existing knowledge by examining how phenological dates are related throughout a breeding season, as well as the reproductive consequences of phenological variation. In contrast to other sites, we saw no evidence at this site of shifts towards early or delayed arrival or clutch initiation. Arrival, clutch initiation dates and the length of the incubation period had different environmental forcing factors, which explained up to 36% of the temporal variability. Penguins had a reduced courtship and egg-lay period when their arrival was delayed, and this led to later clutch initiation, later parent departure for foraging trips and later chick hatch. The phenological variations recorded here were not detrimental to chick-rearing. In particular, a delay in the start of breeding activities did not result in poor reproductive success. This indicates the importance of other factors for chick survival. Inter-annual phenological variability at this location is compared with that at other locations to further develop the colony latitude-breeding phenology relationship for Adelie penguins.																	0171-8630	1616-1599					2011	440						203	216		10.3354/meps09265							WOS:000296391900017

Short-tailed shearwaters Puffinus tenuirostris visit this region in huge numbers between the boreal summer and autumn during non-breeding season, and represent one of the dominant top predators. To understand the implications for this species of ongoing environmental change in the Pacific sub-Arctic and Arctic seas, we tracked the migratory movements of 19 and 24 birds in 2010 and 2011, respectively, using light-level geolocators. In both years, tracked birds occupied the western (Okhotsk Sea and Kuril Islands) and eastern (southeast Bering Sea) North Pacific from May to July. In August-September of 2010, but not 2011, a substantial proportion (68 % of the tracked individuals in 2010 compared to 38 % in 2011) moved through the Bering Strait to feed in the Chukchi Sea. Based on the correlation with oceanographic variables, the probability of shearwater occurrence was highest in waters with sea surface temperatures (SSTs) of 8-10 A degrees C over shallow depths. Furthermore, shearwaters spent more time flying when SST was warmer than 9 A degrees C, suggesting increased search effort for prey. We hypothesized that the northward shift in the distribution of shearwaters may have been related to temperature-driven changes in the abundance of their dominant prey, krill (Euphausiacea), as the timing of krill spawning coincides with the seasonal increase in water temperature. Our results indicate a flexible response of foraging birds to ongoing changes in the sub-Arctic and Arctic ecosystems.																	0025-3162	1432-1793				FEB	2015	162	2					413	424		10.1007/s00227-014-2589-1							WOS:000348564300016						
J	Arnold, JM; Brault, S; Croxall, JP				Arnold, JM; Brault, S; Croxall, JP			Albatross populations in peril: A population trajectory for black-browed albatrosses at South Georgia	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS												Simulation modeling was used to reconstruct Black-browed Albatross (Diomedea melanophris) population trends. Close approximations to observed data were accomplished by annually varying survival rates, reproductive success, and probabilities of returning to breed given success in previous years. The temporal shift in annual values coincided with the start of longline fishing at South Georgia and potential changes in krill abundance. We used 23 years of demographic data from long-term studies of a breeding colony of this species at Bird Island, South Georgia, to validate our model. When we used annual parameter estimates for survival; reproductive success, and probabilities of returning to breed given success in previous years, our model trajectory closely followed the observed changes in breeding population size over time. Population growth rate was below replacement (lambda < 1) in most years and was most sensitive to changes in adult survival. This supports the recent IUCN uplisting of this species from "Vulnerable" to "Endangered." Comparison of pre-1988 and post-1988 demography (before and after the inception of a longline fishery in the breeding area) reveals a decrease in lambda from 0.963 to 0.910. A life table response experiment (LTRE) showed that this decline in lambda was caused mostly by declines in survival of adults. If 1988-1998 demographic rates are maintained, the model predicts a 98% chance of a population of fewer than 25 pairs within 78 years. For this population to recover to a status under which it could be "delisted," a 10% increase in survival of all age classes would be needed.																	1051-0761	1939-5582				FEB	2006	16	1					419	432		10.1890/03-5340							WOS:000236510100036	16705990

Biochemical zonation	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART I-OCEANOGRAPHIC RESEARCH PAPERS												The composition, biomass, distribution and grazing impact of dominant components of the meso- and macrozooplankton community were investigated along a transect occupied in the Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean during the second cruise of the South African Antarctic Ecosystem Study conducted in late austral summer (Jan.-Feb.) 1993. Total zooplankton abundance along the transect ranged from 6 to 161 ind. m(-3), and biomass levels ranged from 4. 2 to 80.5 mg DWt m(-3). Elevated abundances and biomass were recorded at stations occupied in the vicinity of the Marginal Ice Zone (MIZ), the Antarctic Polar Front (APF) and Subantarctic Front (SAF). Throughout the investigation mesozooplankton, comprising mainly copepods, dominated numerically and by biomass accounting for > 80% of the total. South of the APF, the copepods Calanus propinquus, Calanoides acutus and Metridia gerlachei numerically dominated zooplankton counts, while north of the front the zooplankton community was dominated by the copepods Calanus simillimus, Rhincalanus gigas and Lucicutia ovalis. Grazing impact of the six most abundant zooplankton taxa, accounting for up to 90% of all zooplankton counted at each station, demonstrated large spatial variability ranging from 0.01 to 18% of the chlorophyll (chl-n) standing stock or up to 89% of the daily phytoplankton production (DPP). The highest grazing impact along the transect was recorded within the Polar Front Zone where zooplankton removed between 4 and 18% of the chl-a standing stock or between 53 and 89% of DPP daily. Outside this region, zooplankton grazing generally corresponded to < 5% of the integrated chl-a or < 20% of the daily DPP. The implications of the spatial differences in grazing impact on the efficiency of the biological pump are discussed. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

Following its establishment in 1982, the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR) has managed the ecosystems of the high seas of the Southern Ocean. CCAMLR pioneered the ecosystem approach to resource management, took action on the problem of sea bird by-catch, and has established measures to combat illegal unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing. CCAMLR is seen as an example of best practice in managing marine resources in international waters. At the same time, CCAMLR's challenges arise in the balance between 'fishing' and 'conservation' interests; for example in the current debates over climate change and marine protected areas in the Southern Ocean. In each of these examples, CCAMLR's consensus-based decision-making process has been a central element in shaping outcomes. This paper considers CCAMLR's achievements in sustainable marine ecosystems and identifies emerging challenges. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Foraminifers dominate (75%) the sea-ice community in terms of numerical abundance while turbellarians dominate (45%) in terms of biomass. Distribution of organisms is patchy and varies considerably between cruises but also between sampling sites within one cruise. The bulk of the meio-fauna is concentrated in the lowest parts of the sea ice, especially during winter and autumn. However, in porous summer sea ice, sympagic organisms also occur in high densities in upper and intermediate layers of sea ice. Proto- and metazoans associated with Antarctic sea ice include organisms actually living in sea ice, as well as those on the underside of floes and in the underlying water. The sea-ice habitat serves as a feeding ground, as well as an important nursery for juveniles, providing energy-rich food resources. The ice also constitutes a shelter from predators.

Physical speciation and solubility of iron from baleen whale faecal material	MARINE CHEMISTRY												Primary productivity in large areas of the Southern Ocean is limited by the availability of a key micronutrient iron (Fe). Recently it has been suggested that marine animals could play an important role in recycling Fe through their diet and subsequent defecation, however there is no information on the relative bioavailability of faecal Fe for uptake. The bioavailability of Fe in seawater is controlled by a number of complex interactions. The physical separation between the dissolved ( < 0.2 mu m) and particulate ( > 0.2 mu m) fractions is one common measure used to determine element bioavailability. Here, the size fractionation of Fe from 3 whale faecal samples in 4 different size classes ( < 0.2 mu m, 0.2-10 mu m, 10-60 mu m and > 60 mu m) was investigated, along with the leaching of particulate Fe over time. Although the total particulate fraction (> 0.2 mu m, 5026-22,526 nmol L-1) dominated the total Fe pool, the concentrations of dissolved Fe in whale faecal samples (186-754 nmol L-1) were three order of magnitude higher than published Southern Ocean surface seawater concentrations. Furthermore, results from the leaching experiment suggest that Fe is continually leached from faecal particles over an initial 12-hour period, thus increasing the concentration of bioavailable Fe in surface seawater. Although the concentrations measured here are some of the highest reported in the literature, the true supply of Fe back to surface seawater will be controlled by processes such as organic complexation, scavenging and sinking by particles, remineralisation, and vertical transport, not measured in this study.

In this paper, we described the gene organization, gene rearrangement and codon usage in the mitochondrial genome of Euphausia superba Dana 1852 (sampling from Prydz Bay, PB). The mitochondrial genome of E. superba is more than 15,498 bp in length (partial non-coding region was not determined). Translocation of four tRNAs (trnL (1) , trnL (2) , trnW and trnI) and duplication of one tRNA (trnN) were founded in the mitochondrial genome of E. superba when comparing its genome with the pancrustacean ground pattern. To investigate the phylogenetic relationship within Malacostraca, phylogenetic trees based on currently available malacostracan mitochondrial genomes were built with the maximum likelihood and the Bayesian models. All analyses based on nucleotide and amino acid data strongly support the monophyly of Stomatopoda, Penaeidae, Caridea, and Brachyura, which is consistent with previous research. However, the taxonomic position of Euphausiacea within Malacostraca is unstable. From comparing the mitochondrial genome between E. superba (PB) and E. superba (sampling from Weddell Sea, WS), we found that nad2 gene contains maximal variation with 61 segregating sites, following by nad5 gene which has 12 segregating sites. Thus, nad2 and nad5 genes may be used as potential molecular markers to study the inherit diversity among different E. superba groups, which would be helpful to the exploitation and management of E. superba resources.

Inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES) was used for detection. The operating conditions (chemical and physical parameters) and the concentrations of the acids studied were optimized for the generation of PbH4 (plumbane). Analytical figures of merit including detection limit, precision, and linear dynamic range are given for the four systems employed. The detection limits for Pb ranged between 4.4 and 6.8 mug L-1 depending on the acid used to generate plumbane. Compared to conventional continuous nebulization on a radial ICP, the present coupling gives a sensitivity increase of a factor of approximately two orders of magnitude. The interferent effect of transition metals (Al, Cd, Co, Cu, Cr, Fe, Mn, Mo, Ni, V, and Zn), other hydride-forming elements (As, Bi, Ge, Sb, Se, Sn, and Te,) and Hg upon the Pb signal using the different acids studied were evaluated. Nickel, Se, and Te are the elements that more severely affect plumbane generation in the four systems tested. Plumbane was produced with 85% efficiency in tartaric acid; also a better control of interferences was observed. Method validation was achieved using two certified reference materials, MURST-ISS-A2 (Antarctic Krill) and CRM 063R (Skim Milk Powder), for which reasonable agreement between certified and measured values for lead content was obtained. The proposed method was applied to the determination of Pb at mug g(-1) and mug L-1 levels in foods and beverages, respectively. The determination of Pb in these kinds of samples is of high toxicological relevance.																	0195-5373	2708-521X				JUL-AUG	2003	24	4					133	142									WOS:000185067400004

The physical, chemical, optical, and biological characteristics of the upper water column (0-750 m) were determined at 91 hydrographic stations. Analysis of the temperature and salinity data showed that six different hydrographic zones could be differentiated. The biological (phytoplankton distribution and abundance) and chemical (inorganic nutrient concentrations) data also showed characteristic differences within each of these six zones. In spite of high concentrations of inorganic N, P, and Si in all six zones, all stations in the northwest portion of the sampling grid (Drake Passage waters) showed very low chlorophyll-a concentrations in surface waters and a sub-surface maximum at increased depth. As stations in this zone have a relatively stable upper mixed layer of 40 m, excess macro-nutrients, and adequate solar radiation for maximal photosynthetic rates, this suggests that rates of primary production in this zone are limited by a micro-nutrient such as Fe. Phytoplankton abundance was much greater in the Bransfield Strait, in waters influenced by Bellingshausen Sea Water, and in the frontal zones where these water masses mix with Drake Passage waters. Relatively low and deeply distributed phytoplankton abundance was found at all stations in the southeastern portion of our sampling grid, where the upper water column was very weakly stratified and showed the characteristics of Weddell Sea water. The areas of enhanced phytoplankton biomass in the AMLR sampling grid roughly correspond to the areas where krill are generally also found in greater abundance.

J	Thiebot, JB; Weimerskirch, H				Thiebot, Jean-Baptiste; Weimerskirch, Henri			Contrasted associations between seabirds and marine mammals across four biomes of the southern Indian Ocean	JOURNAL OF ORNITHOLOGY												Seabirds associations with marine mammals have been shown to be an efficient way by which the seabirds can detect and access prey patches. However, these associations have been documented locally in the literature and their relevance at the ecosystem level is unknown, mostly because they constitute relatively rare events and therefore few appropriate data exist. In this study, we aimed at quantifying and qualifying these interactions, based on long-term standardised at-sea observations carried out from 1978 to 2005 in the whole southern Indian Ocean. We(1) investigated whether the observed interspecific associations between foraging seabirds and marine mammals could be distinguished from chance using a bootstrap method, and(2) compared their occurrences between four oceanic biomes sampled(tropical, subtropical, subantarctic, Antarctic). Although in our data we could not discriminate active association versus aggregation of species feeding on the same prey patches, our results indicate that, in each biome, 5-10 seabird species were more frequently associated with marine mammals than expected due to chance. Tropical birds appeared to be associated almost exclusively with Delphinidae schools, whereas in the subtropical waters, all the significant associations occurred with marine mammals others than dolphins. In the subantarctic biome, seabirds were mostly associated with Pinnipeds, and the highly productive Antarctic waters provided opportunities for diverse but rare associations. This study suggests that the ecological links between foraging predators can be measured using a randomisation method, and provides conclusive and comparative information on the ecology of apex trophic levels organisms from pelagic communities.

Objective: Biochemical distinctions, regulation of the catalytic function, and the key residues of EFP were investigated. Methods: The serial inhibition kinetic evaluations coupled with measurements of fluorescence spectra in the presence of 4-(2-aminoethyl) benzene sulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride (AEBSF) was conducted. The computational molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were also applied for a comparative study. Results: The enzyme behaved as a monomeric protein with a molecular mass of about 28.6 kD with K-m(BApNA) = 0.629 +/- 0.02 mM and k(cat)/K-m(BApNA) = 7.08 s(-1)/mM. The real-time interval measurements revealed that the inactivation was a first-order reaction, with the kinetic processes shifting from a monophase to a biphase. Measurements of fluorescence spectra showed that serine residue modification by AEBSF directly caused conspicuous changes of the tertiary structures and exposed hydrophobic surfaces. Some osmolytes were applied to find protective roles. These results confirmed that the active region of EFP is more flexible than the overall enzyme molecule and serine, as the key residue, is associated with the regional unfolding of EFP in addition to its catalytic role. The MD simulations were supportive to the kinetics data. Conclusion: Our study indicated that EFP has an essential serine residue for its catalyst function and associated folding behaviors. Also, the functional role of osmolytes such as proline and glycine that may play a role in defense mechanisms from environmental adaptation in a krill's body was suggested.																	0929-8665	1875-5305					2021	28	6					651	664		10.2174/0929866527666201112123714							WOS:000691406900005	33183186

Humpback whale "super-groups" - A novel low-latitude feeding behaviour of Southern Hemisphere humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) in the Benguela Upwelling System	PLOS ONE												Southern Hemisphere humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) generally undertake annual migrations from polar summer feeding grounds to winter calving and nursery grounds in subtropical and tropical coastal waters. Evidence for such migrations arises from seasonality of historic whaling catches by latitude, Discovery and natural mark returns, and results of satellite tagging studies. Feeding is generally believed to be limited to the southern polar region, where Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) has been identified as the primary prey item. Non-migrations and / or suspended migrations to the polar feeding grounds have previously been reported from a summer presence of whales in the Benguela System, where feeding on euphausiids (E. lucens), hyperiid amphipods (Themisto gaudichaudii), mantis shrimp (Pterygosquilla armata capensis) and clupeid fish has been described. Three recent research cruises (in October/November 2011, October/November 2014 and October/November 2015) identified large tightly-spaced groups (20 to 200 individuals) of feeding humpback whales aggregated over at least a one-month period across a 220 nautical mile region of the southern Benguela System. Feeding behaviour was identified by lunges, strong milling and repetitive and consecutive diving behaviours, associated bird and seal feeding, defecations and the pungent "fishy" smell of whale blows. Although no dedicated prey sampling could be carried out within the tightly spaced feeding aggregations, observations of E. lucens in the region of groups and the full stomach contents of mantis shrimp from both a co-occurring predatory fish species (Thyrsites atun) and one entangled humpback whale mortality suggest these may be the primary prey items of at least some of the feeding aggregations. Reasons for this recent novel behaviour pattern remain speculative, but may relate to increasing summer humpback whale abundance in the region. These novel, predictable, inter-annual, low latitude feeding events provide considerable potential for further investigation of Southern Hemisphere humpback feeding behaviours in these relatively accessible low-latitude waters.

Larvae of Euphausia crystallorophias Holt and Tattersall and Thysanoessa macrura G.O. Sars were observed in the study area every year in contrast to larvae of Euphausia superba which were absent during the entire period of sampling. Highest abundances of both species were observed during the summer of 2005 and the lowest in the summer of 2004. Larvae of E. crystallorophias dominated every year and comprised more than 80% of the total abundance of euphausiid larvae. Within species, the calyptopis stages especially calyptopis 1 of E. crystallorophias dominated compared to furcilia stages of T. macrura which were less abundant. For both species, spatio-temporal variations in abundances of developmental stages were significantly correlated to density and salinity of the deep water layer. In the case of calyptopis 3 of E. crystallorophias, spatio-temporal variations were correlated with the number of days between the end of the sea ice retreat and the sampling day and for T. macrura inversely correlated to temperature of surface water layer. These variations are discussed and related to the timing of sea ice retreat, the sea ice concentration as well as metabolic conditions of adults of both species during their spawning period.

The objective of this study was to explore spatio-temporal distribution patterns of Antarctic blue whales in the Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean, using passive acoustic monitoring data. Multi-year data were collected between 2008 and 2013 by 11 recorders deployed in the Weddell Sea and along the Greenwich meridian. Antarctic blue whale Z-calls were detected via spectrogram cross-correlation. A Blue Whale Index was developed to quantify the proportion of time during which acoustic energy from Antarctic blue whales dominated over background noise. Our results show that Antarctic blue whales were acoustically present year-round, with most call detections between January and April. During austral summer, the number of detected calls peaked synchronously throughout the study area in most years, and hence, no directed meridional movement pattern was detectable. During austral winter, vocalizations were recorded at latitudes as high as 69 degrees S, with sea ice cover exceeding 90%, suggesting that some Antarctic blue whales overwinter in Antarctic waters. Polynyas likely serve as an important habitat for baleen whales during austral winter, providing food and reliable access to open water for breathing. Overall, our results support increasing evidence of a complex and non-obligatory migratory behavior of Antarctic blue whales, potentially involving temporally and spatially dynamic migration routes and destinations, as well as variable timing of migration to and from the feeding grounds.

Differences in foraging behaviour were most pronounced during the guard stage of chick rearing. Female penguins made on average longer foraging trips than males, ranged greater distances more frequently and consumed larger quantities of krill. In contrast, males made shorter journeys to closer foraging grounds during the guard period and fed more-extensively on fish throughout chick rearing. Mean guard stage foraging trip durations over four seasons at Bechervaise Island, Eastern Antarctica and over two seasons at Edmonson Point, Ross Sea ranged between 31 and 73 h for females and 25 and 36 h for males. Ninety-percent of males tracked from Bechervaise Island by satellite during the first 3 weeks post-hatch foraged within 20 km of the colony, while the majority(60%) of females travelled to the edge of the continental shelf (80-120 km from the colony)to feed during this period.

G.; Duinker, Arne; Sanden, Monica			Undesirables in Mesopelagic Species and Implications for Food and Feed Safety-Insights from Norwegian Fjords	FOODS												The increase in the global population demands more biomass from the ocean as future food and feed, and the mesopelagic species might contribute significantly. In the present study, we evaluated the food and feed safety of six of the most abundant mesopelagic species in Norwegian fjords. Trace elements (i.e., arsenic, cadmium, mercury, and lead), organic pollutants (i.e., dioxins, furans, dioxin-like polychlorinated biphenyls, and polybrominated flame-retardants), and potentially problematic lipid compounds (i.e., wax esters and erucic acid) were analyzed and compared to existing food and feed maximum levels and intake recommendations. Furthermore, contaminant loads in processed mesopelagic biomass (protein, oil, and fish meal) was estimated using worst-case scenarios to identify possible food and feed safety issues. While most undesirables were low considering European food legislation, we identified a few potential food safety issues regarding high levels of fluoride in Northern krill, wax esters in glacier lanternfish, and long-chain monounsaturated fatty acids in silvery lightfish. Our estimates in processed biomass indicated high levels of undesirable trace elements in the protein fraction, frequently exceeding the maximum levels for feed ingredients. However, in fish meal, almost no exceedances were seen. In the oil fraction, dioxins and furans were above the maximum levels, given for food and feed ingredients. The present study is crucial to enable an evaluation of the value of these species; however, more data is needed before proceeding with large-scale harvesting of mesopelagic biomass.

From the oligotrophic South Pacific (10 degrees S) to the Subtropical Front (STF), we observed the maximum concentrations of CH4 in the subsurface layer which ranged from 2.7 to 3.9 nmol kg(-1). South of the STF, higher levels of CH4 were often detected in both the surface and the subsurface layers. Elevated surface CH4 concentrations (3.4-6.1 nmol kg(-1)) south of the STF tended to be higher than those north of the STF. Higher CH4 were often concomitant with an increase in chlorophyll a levels in the Seasonal Ice Zone (SIZ). Considering that phytoplankton does not generate methane directly, the high CH4 production probably resulted from the grazing processes of Antarctic krill and/or zooplankton fed on phytoplankton and the subsequent microbial methanogenesis in addition to the aerobic CH4 production in the water column. Present results showed a good relation between surface CH4 data (<50 m) and sigma(theta) between 10 degrees S and the Polar Front (PF), which allow us to provide interpolation/extrapolation schemes for CH4 concentration and sea-air CH4 flux in the wide area ([CH4] = 0.15 sigma(theta) - 0.98 (RMS = 0.21 nmol kg(-1), r = 0.68, n = 49, p < 0.001). The sea-air fluxes estimated during our survey were from 2.4 to 4.9 mol CH4 km(-2) d(-1) between 10 degrees S and the PF (54 degrees S), and from 0.8 to 2.3 mol CH4 km(-2) d(-1) south of the PF, where the sea-air CH4 flux was largely affected by the wind speed.

Autonomous Gliders Reveal Features of the Water Column Associated with Foraging by Adelie Penguins	INTEGRATIVE AND COMPARATIVE BIOLOGY					Annual Meeting of the Society-for-Integrative-and-Comparative-Biology	JAN 03-07, 2010	Seattle, WA	Soc Integrat & Comparat Biol				Despite their strong dependence on the pelagic environment, seabirds and other top predators in polar marine ecosystems are generally studied during their reproductive phases in terrestrial environments. As a result, a significant portion of their life history is understudied which in turn has led to limited understanding. Recent advances in autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) technologies have allowed satellite-tagged Adelie penguins to guide AUV surveys of the marine environment at the Palmer Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) site on the western Antarctic Peninsula. Near real-time data sent via Iridium satellites from the AUVs to a centralized control center thousands of miles away allowed scientists to adapt AUV sampling strategies to meet the changing conditions of the subsurface. Such AUV data revealed the water masses and fine-scale features associated with Adelie penguin foraging trips. During this study, the maximum concentration of chlorophyll was between 30 and 50 m deep. Encompassing this peak in the chlorophyll concentration, within the water-column, was a mixture of nutrient-laden Upper Circumpolar Deep (UCDW) and western Antarctic Peninsula winter water (WW). Together, data from the AUV survey and penguin dives reveal that 54% of foraging by Adelie penguins occurs immediately below the chlorophyll maximum. These data demonstrate how bringing together emerging technologies, such as AUVs, with established methods such as the radio-tagging of penguins can provide powerful tools for monitoring and hypothesis testing of previously inaccessible ecological processes. Ocean and atmosphere temperatures are expected to continue increasing along the western Antarctic Peninsula, which will undoubtedly affect regional marine ecosystems. New and emerging technologies such as unmanned underwater vehicles and individually mounted satellite tracking devices will provide the tools critical to documenting and understanding the widespread ecological change expected in polar regions.				schofield, oscar/H-4169-2018	schofield, oscar/0000-0003-2359-4131												1540-7063	1557-7023				DEC	2010	50	6					1041	1050		10.1093/icb/icq098							WOS:000284430400012	21558258

Three principal biogeographic zones were identified: northern Gerlache Strait, Bransfield Strait and Drake Passage; these were recognizable by consistent patterns of physical circulation. Two cohorts of E. superba larvae were produced. The first cohort appeared as C1 larvae in mid-January, and the second appeared in mid-February; the second cohort did not occur in Gerlache Strait waters. Larvae in Gerlache Strait were more abundant, larger in size and weight, better fed, and developed and grew more rapidly than larvae of the same stages in both Bransfield Strait and Drake Passage. In Gerlache Strait abundance reached 12,000 individuals m-2, intermolt periods were < 8 days for early calyptopis stages, and growth rates were higher than any previously reported. Growth of early stages was exponential during late January, but slowed markedly by late March as the population entered late furcilia stages. Calptopis stages were estimated to ingest up to 19.7% of their body carbon per day, and 14.5% of body nitrogen per day. The daily ration of late furcilia stages was reduced to 4.4% body carbon per day, and 1.9% body nitrogen per day. Gross growth efficiencies ranged, in terms of carbon, from 13.2% for furcilia to 52.5% for calyptopis stages; in terms of nitrogen they ranged from 29.9 to 65.5%. It is proposed that the northern Gerlache Strait is a primary nursery area for E. superba, and that local circulation promotes high primary productivity and prolongs the residence time of larvae in a nearshore environment which is favorable to development and growth. Coastal environments such as Gerlache Strait may make a disproportionately large contribution to annual krill recruitment.																	0198-0149					AUG-SEP	1991	38	8-9					1213	1240		10.1016/0198-0149(91)90103-M							WOS:A1991GH34600015

The main scope of the current study was to investigate chemical exposure of humpback whales breeding in the Indian Ocean by providing the first published data on this breeding stock concerning persistent organic pollutants (POPs), namely polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), hexachlorobenzene (HCB), hexachlorocyclohexanes (HCHs), DDT and its metabolites (DDTs), chlordane compounds (CHL5), polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), and methoxylated PBDEs (MeO-PBDEs). Analyses of stable isotopes delta C-13 and delta N-15 in skin resulted in further insight in their feeding ecology, which was in agreement with a diet focused mainly on low trophic level prey species, such as krill from Antarctica. POPs were measured in all humpback whales in the order of HCB > DDTs > CHLs > HCHs > PCBs > PBDEs > MeO-BDEs. HCB (median: 24 ng g(-1) lw) and DDTs (median: 7.7 ng g(-1) lw) were the predominant compounds in all whale biopsies. Among DDT compounds, p,p'-DDE was the major organohalogenated pollutant, reflecting its long-term accumulation in humpback whales. Significantly lower concentrations of HCB and DDTs were found in females than in males (p < 0.001). Other compounds were similar between the two genders (p > 0.05). Differences in the HCB and DDTs suggested gender-specific transfer of some compounds to the offspring. POP concentrations were lower than previously reported results for humpback whales sampled near the Antarctic Peninsula, suggesting potential influence of their nutritional status and may indicate different exposures of the whales according to their feeding zones. Further investigations are required to assess exposure of southern humpback whales throughout their feeding zones. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Temperature-dependent growth of Thysanoessa macrura: inter-annual and spatial variability around Elephant Island, Antarctica	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												Somatic growth of pelagic invertebrates is controlled by temperature and food, both of which vary in space and time. Species-specific growth rate responses to environmental variability may affect populations through changes in reproductive potential; therefore, measuring spatial and temporal variability in growth rates of highly abundant zooplankton is critical to predict the impact of climate change on pelagic ecosystems. Here, we used length frequencies from bi-annual surveys conducted 1 month apart to estimate growth rates of one the most abundant euphausiids in the Southern Ocean, Thysanoessa macrura. We analyzed summer data from 4 separate years (1995, 1998, 2001, and 2004) that varied widely in temperature and primary production. Stations within the surveys were grouped by water characteristics: warm, low salinity Antarctic Circum polar Current (ACC) water, and cold, saline Bransfield Strait and Weddell Sea (MBW) water, to assess inter-annual and spatial variability in cohort growth. Mid-summer cohort growth rates of T. macrura varied between years and water masses, ranging from -0.037 mm d(-1) in MBW water in 2004 to 0.081 mm d(-1) in ACC water in 1995. Growth rates were faster in ACC water than in MBW water during all years. Growth rates were strongly correlated with temperature (R-2 = 0.82) but weakly correlated with copepod density (R-2 = 0.38), and were not correlated with chl a concentration (R-2 = 0.11). These results suggest that the growth rates of T. macrura may increase in regions exhibiting warming trends, such as the Antarctic Peninsula. This contrasts with published data on the growth rates of Euphausia superba, which is predicted to be impacted negatively by climate warming.																	0171-8630	1616-1599				JUN 8	2015	529						49	61		10.3354/meps11291							WOS:000356076000004

Feeding dynamics	MARINE BIOLOGY												Feeding dynamics of the Antarctic salps Ihlea racovitzai and Salpa thompsoni were studied in the Lazarev Sea in fall 2004, summer 2005-2006 and winter 2006. Pigment concentrations in the guts of both species were positively correlated with ambient surface chlorophyll a (chl a). No evidence was found for salp clogging even at dense surface concentrations of up to 7 mu g chl a L-1. However, gut pigment concentrations had a lower range than ambient pigment concentrations, suggesting that salps increased retention times of ingested material in low-food environments. For medium-sized I. racovitzai and S. thompsoni, estimated individual daily rations reached 7-10 and > 100% of body carbon in winter and summer, respectively. Daily respiratory needs of I. racovitzai and S. thompsoni accounted for 28 and 22% of daily carbon assimilation based on pigment ingestion rates in winter, and for 2 and 1% in summer, respectively. The grazing impact of the salp populations on the phytoplankton standing stock was negligible during all seasons due to generally low salp densities. Fatty acid trophic biomarkers in the salps suggest high year-round contributions of flagellates and modest contributions of diatoms to the salp's diet. These markers showed low seasonal variability for I. racovitzai. The more pronounced seasonality of trophic markers in S. thompsoni were likely related to their generally deeper residence depth in winter linked to a seasonal alternation of sexual and asexual generations.

Gastrointestinal tracts of 37 fresh dead individuals (21 chicks, 10 juveniles, and 6 adults) were collected from December 2006 to February 2012 and examined for macroparasites. Four adult parasite species were found: one Cestoda species (Parorchites zederi), two Nematoda species (Stegophorus macronectes and Tetrameres wetzeli), and one Acanthocephalan (Corynosoma shackletoni). Two species of immature acanthocephalans, Corynosoma hamanni and Corynosoma bullosum, were found in a single host. This is the first record of Tetrameres wetzeli in Gentoo penguins. The low parasite richness observed could be related to the stenophagic and pelagic diet of this host species which feeds almost exclusively on krill.

Composition of wax esters is linked to diapause behavior of Calanus finmarchicus in a sea loch environment	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												We studied the seasonal lipid dynamics of Calanus finmarchicus from Loch Etive, a semi-enclosed fjordic environment on the west coast of Scotland, in relation to the diapause behavior of this species. Levels of total lipid and triacylglycerol in individual copepodid stage V (CVs) exhibited clear seasonal trends, with highest levels in June and progressively decreasing through late summer to winter. Wax esters in CVs were more variable, but followed a similar pattern. An index of the level of unsaturation of wax esters, effectively an indicator of the levels of polyunsaturated fatty acids in the wax ester reserves, were highest in midsummer and declined progressively through autumn and winter. Fatty acid analysis of total lipid in the CVs confirmed that the amounts of polyunsaturated fatty acids in the wax esters decreased, while amounts of saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids remained comparatively stable. Polyunsaturated wax esters are selectively catabolized by C. finmarchicus during diapause. Previous studies have linked unsaturation of wax esters in calanoid copepods to the initiation of diapause and buoyancy control, and we hypothesize that selective catabolism of polyunsaturated wax esters is linked to the processes of diapause termination and ascent to surface waters.																	0024-3590	1939-5590				JAN	2012	57	1					65	75		10.4319/lo.2012.57.1.0065							WOS:000298321300006						
J	Varpe, O				Varpe, Oystein			Fitness and phenology: annual routines and zooplankton adaptations to seasonal cycles	JOURNAL OF PLANKTON RESEARCH												Behaviour and life-history strategies of zooplankton have evolved in response to seasonal cycles in food availability, predation risk and abiotic conditions. A key challenge is to understand how different activities over the year are linked. For instance, how does a change in spring activities, such as the timing or amount of egg production, influence autumn activities, for instance energy storage or migration? Trade-offs viewed in relation to individual lifetime fitness consequences couple these events. The framework of optimal annual routines provides theory and methodology for consistent analyses of these temporal trade-offs. Here I describe the key parts of optimal annual routine models and how the models can be used to: (i) study phenology, life-history strategies, and population dynamics; (ii) predict responses to environmental change; and (iii) guide future zooplankton studies. I mainly discuss the adaptations of zooplankton species inhabiting high latitude oceans where the seasonal cycle and its effects are particularly strong. Empirical challenges include issues of seasonal resolution, state-dependent processes and individual variability. Two ecological problems with avenues for future work are discussed in particular detail: the role of sea ice and ice algae in the life cycle of copepods and krill, and the adaptive value and ecological consequences of semelparous versus iteroparous reproductive strategies.

In contrast to the more southern regions, the PFr was characterised by the occurrence of relatively dense phytoplankton blooms and high copepod concentrations. Faecal pellets were relatively abundant in the MIZ reaching up to 106 mug faccal pellet carbon (FPC) m(-3), whereas the concentrations in the more northern regions were about one to two orders of magnitude lower: ca. 6 mug FPC m(-3) in the southern ACC and less than 1 mug FPC m(-3) in the PFr. Thus, the region with the highest phyto- and zooplankton concentrations showed by far the lowest faecal pellet standing stock concentrations. These results and their potential ecological significance are discussed in relation to other regions of the world oceans. We conclude, that not only the biomass of phytoplankton and zooplankton, but also the structure of the plankton communities are decisive for sedimentation potentials of carbon and silica via faecal pellets in the different regions of the ocean.

J	Zhou, M; Huntley, ME				Zhou, M; Huntley, ME			The principle of biological attraction, demonstrated by the bio-continuum theory of zooplankton patch dynamics	JOURNAL OF MARINE RESEARCH												A theory of zooplankton and micronekton patch dynamics is developed that expressly includes animal behavior. This represents a departure from traditional models of patch dynamics, which generally treat animals as Lagrangian particles whose distributions are determined solely by processes of advection and diffusion. The ''bio-continuum'' theory is based on principles of statistical mechanics, and describes animal aggregations in terms of mean motion, random motion, random kinetic energy, distribution and abundance. The forces on an animal aggregation act both upon the aggregation as a whole (external forces) or between individuals (internal forces). We demonstrate here that the internal forces which serve to maintain autocoherence are, in essence, a force of biological attraction that can be quantified in Newtons. A coefficient of biological attraction is defined, and its magnitude evaluated in aggregations of Antarctic euphausiids (Euphausia superba). We hypothesize that the coefficient of biological attraction may be constant for all organisms in the sea. A method for measuring all key variables with acoustic Doppler technology is presented, with specific attention to application of the Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP). We conclude that bio-continuum theory, coupled with acoustic Doppler observations, provides a practical approach for studying animal aggregation dynamics in the sea.																	0022-2402	1543-9542				SEP	1996	54	5					1017	1037		10.1357/0022240963213619							WOS:A1996VP29700008

First global census of the Adelie Penguin	AUK												We report on the first global census of the Adelie Penguin (Pygoscelis adeliae), achieved using a combination of ground counts and satellite imagery, and find a breeding population 53% larger (3.79 million breeding pairs) than the last estimate in 1993. We provide the first abundance estimates for 41 previously unsurveyed colonies, which collectively contain 420,000 breeding pairs, and report on 17 previously unknown colonies, 11 of which may be recent colonizations. These recent colonizations represent similar to 5% of the increase in known breeding population and provide insight into the ability of these highly philopatric seabirds to colonize new breeding territories. Additionally, we report on 13 colonies not found in the survey, including 8 that we conclude have gone extinct. We find that Adelie Penguin declines on the Antarctic Peninsula are more than offset by increases in East Antarctica. Our global population assessment provides a robust baseline for understanding future changes in abundance and distribution. These results are a critically needed contribution to ongoing negotiations regarding the design and implementation of Marine Protected Areas for the Southern Ocean.																	0004-8038	1938-4254				OCT	2014	131	4					457	466		10.1642/AUK-14-31.1							WOS:000344823200001

V. ''Marion Dufresne'', in February 1981, to the southwest Indian Ocean. Individual and mean coefficients of condition (K(m)) were calculated from variations in weight as a function of total length and of carapace length. In E. superba, no significant differences were found as a function of sex or development stage in either total length and weight or carapace length and weight. In T. macrura, a significant allometric difference emerged in the wet weight of juveniles, males and females as a function of total length, and in wet weight as a function of carapace length between adults and subadults. In both E. superba and T. macrura, wet weight as a function of total length differed significantly among stations, and also between species, with a greater weight increase for T. macrura in summer. The coefficients of condition calculated for all wet weight-total length relationships showed that the morphologically different Group II males were heavier than Group I males and mature females. K(m) in T. macrura was higher for females than for juveniles or males, indicating a greater weight gain by the females. These differences probably reflect real differences in physiology and may affect the distribution of these two species.																	0025-3162	1432-1793				MAR	1994	118	4					645	650		10.1007/BF00347512							WOS:A1994NE90100014

Thysanoessa macrura in the southern Kerguelen region: Population dynamics and biomass	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY												Thysanoessa macrura is well adapted to the strong seasonality of the Southern Ocean. A flexible diet, large lipid reserves and a winter reproductive period provide T. macrura with the ability to capitalise on the pulses of primary and secondary reproduction in spring and summer. The population dynamics of T. macrura were examined over the southern Kerguelen Plateau region as part of a large-scale ecosystem assessment. Larval stages were present in high abundances, exceeding 4000 Ind. 1000 m(-3), with a peak in early furcilia (FI - FIV) and lower abundances of calyptopis stages (CI - CIII) indicating the end of a prolonged spawning period. High abundances of T. macrura were recorded throughout the entire study region, although they tended to be highest over the southern extent of the Banzare Bank and Princess Elizabeth Trough. This maximum appeared to be driven by the presence of the copepod Calanoides acutus, a dominant prey source. The first biomass estimates of T. macrura were determined for the region using length-frequency and abundance distributions. A mean biomass of 1.66 mg m(-3) (wet weight) was calculated for the region, however localised biomass over the southern tip of the Banzare Bank exceeded 9 mg m(-3) in the upper 200 m of the water column. The high biomass of T. macrura highlights their significance as an energy-rich resource for larger predators, inferring they play a currently underappreciated role in pelagic food-webs of the Southern Ocean.

J	Robertson, RR; Bjorkstedt, EP				Robertson, Roxanne R.; Bjorkstedt, Eric P.			Climate-driven variability in Euphausia pacifica size distributions off northern California	PROGRESS IN OCEANOGRAPHY												We analyzed an 11-year data set of length measurements for Euphausia pacifica, resolved by developmental stages ranging from early furcilia through adults, to characterize temporal variability in size distributions in relation to environmental and climate forcing in coastal waters of the northern California Current. Our analysis reveals that coastal size distributions of this linchpin species are related to temperature and chlorophyll a concentration, and indicate that warm climate events disrupt and suppress typical seasonal dynamics, resulting in persistent shifts towards populations dominated by smaller juveniles and adults. The 2014-16 marine heatwave (MHW) resulted in sharp and sustained transition in the size structure of E. pacifica off northern California; we captured numerous mature individuals smaller than any previously reported in the literature and larger size classes were conspicuously absent or rare when the MHW most strongly impacted coastal waters. Early life history stages exhibited a contrasting response, shifting instead towards larger size distributions during warm years. Advection appears to be the dominant mechanism driving rapid shifts in E. pacifica size structure off northern California, which implies alongshore and cross-shelf gradients in life history expression (e.g., changes in size-at-maturation) related primarily to temperature. Variability in food availability (chlorophyll concentration) and physiological responses (e.g., changes in growth rates) likely contribute to seasonal variability, but appear insufficient to account for sharp, climate-driven transitions. Climate-driven shifts in individual and total biomass of this critical and dominant forage species have important ecological implications, particularly for growth and survival of species at higher trophic levels. Given that warm water events are likely to increase with climate change, the effects of the 2014-16 MHW on E. pacifica in coastal waters may serve as a harbinger for future change. Detailed information on size structure of euphausiid populations is fundamental to understanding population responses to and ecosystem consequences of climatic and environmental forcing, and has been incorporated in assessments that support ecosystem-based approaches to fisheries management.																	0079-6611					OCT	2020	188								102412	10.1016/j.pocean.2020.102412							WOS:000582696800001

Factors driving Adelie penguin chick size, mass and condition at colonies of different sizes in the Southern Ross Sea	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												Body size, mass and condition can affect an organism's ability to cope with variation in resource availability or metabolic demand, particularly as juveniles reach independence. It follows that changes to parental provisioning efficiency (size and frequency of meals) through intraspecific competition or environmental conditions that affect prey availability may affect chick size, mass and condition and ultimately post-fledging survival. We examined how Adelie penguin chick size, mass and condition varied among colonies of different sizes on Ross Island during a 15 yr period of high environmental variability and varying intraspecific competition. Aiding the study was a natural experiment in which the presence of 2 giant icebergs midway through the study abnormally increased sea ice concentration (SIC), altering adults' access to food. Concurrently, the colonies were rapidly increasing in size; based on previous work, this indicated increased trophic competition near colonies, a trend likely indicating a changing food web in the greater region. Results showed that increased amounts of sea ice, which reduced the ability of adults to access food, had a negative effect on the size and mass of chicks. However, a greater proportion of fish (vs. krill) in the diet had a positive effect on chick size. Moreover, in some cases, increased intraspecific competition may be a more important driver of provisioning rate and chick size than abiotic factors, with chicks showing the effects of reduced food delivery at larger colonies. Understanding these patterns will allow better understanding of how factors such as climate change and altered food webs may affect Adelie penguin populations.

During the breeding period, proximity to suitable feeding sites is essential for central place foragers, whereas during the non-breeding period their distribution is relatively unconstrained. We combined light-based geolocation and satellite tracking to investigate seasonal variation in foraging grounds and behaviour of white-chinned petrels from Kerguelen Island. Birds were associated with highly productive areas throughout the year. During breeding (summer), they performed long commuting trips from the colony to distant, productive Antarctic waters. Thereafter, birds migrated 5200 km westwards to the Benguela upwelling system off Namibia and South Africa to spend the winter. This seasonal shift of foraging grounds coincides with a change in activity patterns; much less time was spent in flight in winter than in summer. Individual variability in the locations of foraging zones and seasonal/daily activity patterns was low. Trip durations were shorter during chick-rearing than incubation, although birds often travelled as far or farther, tracking the gradual break up of pack ice. Habitat use models revealed an association with distance to sea-ice edge and chlorophyll a gradient during incubation, whereas sea surface temperature and chlorophyll a gradient best explained habitat use during chick rearing. White-chinned petrels are likely to overlap with other marine predators and fisheries throughout the year. Fishery bycatch constitutes the most significant direct threat to petrels at sea. Moreover, future climate-induced reductions in productivity could affect birds year-round.

First, the stability of the response factors (relative sensitivity) against Ti internal standard was checked in the concentration range of 1 to 1000 mg/L in a diluted nitric acid matrix. It has been found that the upper limit of the analytical concentration range for K and Ca can be as high as 1000 mg/L; on the other hand, the remaining elements cannot be determined above a concentration of some tens mg/L. The established response factors were used for the elemental analysis of the four certified reference materials after normal-volume microwave assisted acid digestion. In the case of the serum sample, different preparation methods were compared as follow: direct analysis, microwave assisted acid digestion in normal-volume and micro-vessels, as well as the vapor-phase digestion directly on the TXRF carrier plates. On the basis of the results, the normal-volume digestion results in rather high dilution of the samples; thus, elements at low concentration could not be detected in some of the samples. On the other hand, this method offers the highest rate of both organic matrix decomposition and inorganic matrix dilution; thus, the background and the standard deviation of the results were the lowest. In general, this method was found to be useful for the analysis of samples with high dissolved (organic + inorganic) content if the analytes are present at a concentration considerable above the quantification limit. In the case of the microscale and the vapor-phase digestion, both the organic and inorganic matters remain at elevated concentration; thus, higher background and self-absorption of the fluorescent radiation occurred, deteriorating the analytical performance.

J	Larue, MA; Knight, J				Larue, Michelle A.; Knight, Joseph			Applications of Very High-Resolution Imagery in the Study and Conservation of Large Predators in the Southern Ocean	CONSERVATION BIOLOGY												The Southern Ocean is one of the most rapidly changing ecosystems on the planet due to the effects of climate change and commercial fishing for ecologically important krill and fish. Because sea ice loss is expected to be accompanied by declines in krill and fish predators, decoupling the effects of climate and anthropogenic changes on these predator populations is crucial for ecosystem-based management of the Southern Ocean. We reviewed research published from 2007 to 2014 that incorporated very high-resolution satellite imagery to assess distribution, abundance, and effects of climate and other anthropogenic changes on populations of predators in polar regions. Very high-resolution imagery has been used to study 7 species of polar animals in 13 papers, many of which provide methods through which further research can be conducted. Use of very high-resolution imagery in the Southern Ocean can provide a broader understanding of climate and anthropogenic forces on populations and inform management and conservation recommendations. We recommend that conservation biologists continue to integrate high-resolution remote sensing into broad-scale biodiversity and population studies in remote areas, where it can provide much needed detail.

We studied penguins foraging at all breeding stages, in various sea-ice conditions. For the first time in this species we observed nocturnal patterns of diving as the penguins dived more frequently and spent more time underwater around midnight than around noon. This behaviour may be related to the abundance of neritic krill, Euphausia crystallorophias, in the diet. Dive depth and duration varied extensively over the cycle, and appeared related to sea ice conditions rather than representative of the locality (22 m/78 s and 40 m/102 s with and without sea-ice, respectively). Comparisons with other studies showed that different diving behaviour previously observed in different localities can also occur at the same locality, and in some cases over a single foraging trip of a single penguin when short-term variation of external conditions occurred.																	0722-4060					FEB	2000	23	2					113	120		10.1007/s003000050016							WOS:000085201300006

High latitude changes in ice dynamics and their impact on polar marine ecosystems	YEAR IN ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION BIOLOGY 2008	Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences											Polar regions have experienced significant warming in recent decades. Warming has been most pronounced across the Arctic Ocean Basin and along the Antarctic Peninsula, with significant decreases in the extent and seasonal duration of sea ice. Rapid retreat of glaciers and disintegration of ice sheets have also been documented. The rate of warming is increasing and is predicted to continue well into the current century, with continued impacts on ice dynamics. Climate-mediated changes in ice dynamics are a concern as ice serves as primary habitat for marine organisms central to the food webs of these regions. Changes in the timing and extent of sea ice impose temporal asynchronies and spatial separations between energy requirements and food availability for many higher trophic levels. These mismatches lead to decreased reproductive success, lower abundances, and changes in distribution. In addition to these direct impacts of ice loss, climate-induced changes also facilitate indirect effects through changes in hydrography, which include introduction of species from lower latitudes and altered assemblages of primary producers. Here, we review recent changes and trends in ice dynamics and the responses of marine ecosystems. Specifically, we provide examples of ice-dependent organisms and associated species from the Arctic and Antarctic to illustrate the impacts of the temporal and spatial changes in ice dynamics.

The study reported here adds to the knowledge of gastrointestinal parasites of the Adelie penguin (Pygoscelis adeliae) (Sphenisciformes), from 25 de Mayo/King George Island (South Shetlands), Bahia Esperanza (Hope Bay) and Avian Island (Antarctica). Thirty-five freshly dead specimens (20 chicks and 15 adults) were collected from December 2007 to December 2014 and examined for internal macroparasites. Three adult parasite species were found: one Cestoda, Parorchites zederi, and two Nematoda, Stegophorus macronectes and Tetrameres sp. Immature Tetrabothrius sp. were found in hosts from Avian Island. Helminth communities are known to be related to host feeding behaviours. Low parasite richness observed in Adelie penguins could be related to the stenophagic and pelagic diet of this host species, which feeds almost exclusively on krill.

J	Cisewski, B; Strass, VH; Leach, H				Cisewski, Boris; Strass, Volker H.; Leach, Harry			Circulation and transport of water masses in the Lazarev Sea, Antarctica, during summer and winter 2006	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART I-OCEANOGRAPHIC RESEARCH PAPERS												The distribution and circulation of water masses in the region between 6 degrees W and 3 degrees E and between the Antarctic continental shelf and 60 S are analyzed using hydrographic and shipboard acoustic Doppler current profiler (ADCP) data taken during austral summer 2005/2006 and austral winter 2006. In both seasons two gateways are apparent where Warm Deep Water (WDW) and other water masses enter the Weddell Gyre through the Lazarev Sea: (a) a probably topographically trapped westward, then southwestward circulation around the northwestern edge of Maud Rise with maximum velocities of about 20 cm s(-1) and (b) the Antarctic Coastal Current (AntCC), which is confined to the Antarctic continental shelf slope and is associated with maximum velocities of about 25 cm s(-1). Along two meridional sections that run close to the top of Maud Rise along 3 degrees E, geostrophic velocity shears were calculated from CTD measurements and referenced to velocity profiles recorded by an ADCP in the upper 300 m. The mean accuracy of the absolute geostrophic velocity is estimated at +/-2 cm s(-1). The net baroclinic transport across the 3 degrees E section amounts to 20 and 17 Sv westward for the summer and winter season, respectively. The majority of the baroclinic transport, which accounts for similar to 60% of the total baroclinic transport during both surveys, occurs north of Maud Rise between 65 degrees and 60 degrees S. However, the comparison between geostrophic estimates and direct velocity measurements shows that the circulation within the study area has a strong barotropic component, so that calculations based on the dynamic method underestimate the transport considerably. Estimation of the net absolute volume transports across 3 degrees E suggests a westward flow of 23.9 +/- 19.9 Sv in austral summer and 93.6 +/- 20.1 Sy in austral winter. Part of this large seasonal transport variation can be explained by differences in the gyre-scale forcing through wind stress curl. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	PRINCE, PA; ROTHERY, P; CROXALL, JP; WOOD, AG				PRINCE, PA; ROTHERY, P; CROXALL, JP; WOOD, AG			POPULATION-DYNAMICS OF BLACK-BROWED AND GRAY-HEADED ALBATROSSES DIOMEDEA-MELANOPHRIS AND D-CHRYSOSTOMA AT BIRD ISLAND, SOUTH GEORGIA	IBIS												Population dynamics of Black-browed and Grey-headed Albatrosses Diomedea melanophris and D. chrysostoma were studied at Bird Island, South Georgia, for 17 consecutive years (1975-1991). Over this period, almost all the Grey-headed Albatross colonies decreased at an average rate of 1.8% per annum. Although the total Black-browed Albatross population increased (at 0.8% p.a.), 14 of the 23 colonies (including both study colonies) decreased. Black-browed Albatrosses follow an annual breeding cycle: over 80% of birds successful in rearing a chick and 75% of those failing to do so returned to breed the next year, 5-10% of both categories delayed one further year (even when still paired). Grey-headed Albatrosses are essentially biennial: <1% of successful birds bred the next year, 68% returned to breed 2 years later, 11% the next and 5% not until the fourth year. In contrast, over 50% of birds that failed to rear a chick bred the next year, 23% delayed for one further year. Birds which failed after March did not return the next year, whereas 80% of birds which failed during incubation did breed the following year. Grey-headed Albatrosses showed higher (39%) and more consistent breeding success than Black-browed Albatrosses (29%, including 4 years of almost complete breeding failure); hatching success was similar in both species, and fledging success was the main source of variation in Black-browed Albatross productivity. We link this to the dependence of this species on Antarctic krill, a variable resource largely absent in 3 of the 4 years of widespread failure. Modal age of first breeding was 10 years for Black-browed and 12 years for Grey-headed Albatrosses. Overall, survival rate of juvenile Black-browed Albatrosses to recruitment as breeding birds averaged 28% and 14% for 1960s and 1970s cohorts, respectively; for Grey-headed Albatrosses comparable values were 38% and 6%. Studies of immigration and emigration between colonies showed that no breeding birds moved, that philopatry of fledglings was generally high but that recruitment rates need to be increased by 1-3% to allow for juveniles returning to non-natal colonies. Annual survival of adults averaged 93% (s.e. +/- 0.6) and 95% (s.e. +/- 0.8) for Black-browed and Grey-headed Albatrosses, respectively; for sexed birds, rates were similar for Grey-headed Albatrosses but 2% higher for female Black-browed Albatrosses. With our data, lifetime productivity was 30% higher for Black-browed Albatrosses, but this could be offset by a change in adult survival rate of less than 1%. The proximate reason for the population decline in the studied colonies was high juvenile mortality, which has increased since the 1960s. It is likely that this reflects incidental mortality associated with fisheries (particularly entanglement in long-lines for tuna and collision with net-monitor cables of trawlers), but data are few and mainly circumstantial. Many differences between Grey-headed and Black-browed Albatrosses (e.g. the former showing later sexual maturity, less frequent breeding, higher and more consistent survival) probably relate to basic differences between annual and biennial breeding. Some differences (e.g. breeding success) probably relate to differences in diet; others (e.g. in juvenile survival) may reflect different at-sea distributions. Comparisons with other species revealed species and possibly site-specific differences rather than consistent patterns for annual and biennial breeders.																	0019-1019					JAN	1994	136	1					50	71		10.1111/j.1474-919X.1994.tb08131.x							WOS:A1994MR61200007						
J	McDonnell, AMP; Buesseler, KO				McDonnell, Andrew M. P.; Buesseler, Ken O.			Variability in the average sinking velocity of marine particles	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												We used a new combination of sampling techniques involving in situ imaging of particles in the water column and the collection of particle flux in viscous polyacrylamide gels to estimate the average sinking velocities (W(i,avg)) of marine particles ranging from equivalent spherical diameters of 70 mu m to 6 mm at several locations, depths, and times along the west Antarctica Peninsula to explore the variability of W(i,avg). During the January 2009 deployments, W(i,avg) ranged from about 10 to 150 m d(-1), with the fastest velocities at the large and small ends of the sizes considered. A repeat occupation of one station in Marguerite Bay in February 2009 gave W(i,avg) size distributions that were quite different from those of the previous month, with rapidly sinking small particles and very slow W(i,avg) for the large particle classes. These results demonstrate the importance of diatom aggregates and krill fecal pellets with regard to the ocean's biological pump in this region. The observed variability in space and time indicates that global relationships between particle concentrations and fluxes, or simple theoretical formulations of sinking velocity as a function of particle size (such as a single parameterization of the Stokes' Law), are unsuitable for yielding accurate estimates of particle flux from measurements of the particle size distribution. Combining measurements of W(i,avg) with high-frequency sampling of the particle concentration size distribution would enable the estimation of particle fluxes at much higher temporal and spatial resolutions than is currently possible with conventional sediment trapping methods.

MARINE BIOLOGY												We examined the question, does foraging behaviour of Adelie penguins, Pygoscelis adeliae, change in accord with the prey captured? To provide an answer, we attached instruments that record foraging behaviour to free-ranging Adelie penguins foraging, off Adelie Land, during the late breeding season 1997. Depth of foraging was recorded for nine birds whose diet ranged from krill only to predominantly fish. Previous studies suggested that penguins capturing fish dived to shallower depths, but this could not be verified in our study. Moreover, most other foraging parameters did not indicate any significantly different patterns relative to prey caught. Only swim speed in the commuting phase, but not in the undulatory, bottom phase of deep dives differed with respect to prey consumed. We conclude that Adelie penguins foraging in open waters may change their foraging behaviour only slightly depending on the prey. Under other conditions, these changes may become more significant.

Results from regional surveys around Elephant Island in 1994/95 and 1996/97 seasons also were examined. During the CCAMLR 2000 Survey, salp abundance was higher in the Antarctic Peninsula and South Sandwich Island areas than in the central Scotia Sea. The probable reason for this pattern is a negative relationship with phytoplankton abundance; the central Scotia Sea having greater phytoplankton concentrations than required for optimal salp filter-feeding performance. Cluster analysis of salp size composition resulted in three cluster groups for each of the three surveys. Clusters comprising large salps occurred in warmer waters in all three surveys. The size composition of the salp populations suggests that the timing of intense asexual reproductive budding was earlier in warmer waters. As surface water temperatures generally decrease from north to south, and increase from spring to summer, the general spatio-temporal pattern of asexual reproduction by budding is likely to proceed from north to south as the summer season progresses.

Opening and closing nets were used to investigate patterns in the distribution and abundance of mesopelagic fish from the surface to 1000 m on a series of transects across the Scotia Sea from the ice-edge to the Antarctic Polar Front. A total of 141 non-target net hauls were undertaken during three cruises (Nov 2006, Jan 2008 and Mar 2009), with 7852 teleost fish captured, representing 43 species in 17 families. A further 1517 fish were caught in targeted net hauls. The dominant families were the Myctophidae (6961 specimens: 21 species) and Bathylagidae (1467 specimens: 4 species). Few fish were caught in the upper 400 m during daylight, which was attributed to a combination of net avoidance and diurnal vertical migration. Species composition was linked to depth and location and was closely associated with oceanographic features. Diversity was lowest in cold water at the most southerly stations, which were dominated by Electrona antarctica, Gymnoscopelus braueri and Bathylagus antarcticus. Further north, diversity increased with the addition of species such as Krefftichthys anderssoni, Protomyctophum bolini and Electrona carlsbergi. The depth integrated biomass of myctophids was similar across the latitudinal transect and produced an estimate of 4.5 million tonnes in the Scotia Sea. Bathylagids were patchily distributed, but were abundant in the lower mesopelagic zone (> 400 m) and are potentially significant zooplankton consumers. Given the biomass of the myctophids and bathylagids coupled with the vertical migrations of many species, these fish are likely to play a significant role in carbon export from the surface waters to the deep ocean.

J	Cripps, GC; Hill, HJ				Cripps, GC; Hill, HJ			Changes in lipid composition of copepods and Euphausia superba associated with diet and environmental conditions in the marginal ice zone, Bellingshausen Sea, Antarctica	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART I-OCEANOGRAPHIC RESEARCH PAPERS												The effect of varying diet and environmental conditions at the Marginal Ice Zone (MIZ) on the fatty acid and hydrocarbon compositions of five species of copepod and krill, Euphausia superba, was investigated. Zooplankton at the MIZ experienced a range of conditions, from a low algal biomass (mainly flagellates) under pack-ice to a spring bloom dominated by diatoms in the open ocean. Principal Component Analysis classified the copepods into three dietary regimes: (i) omnivores or general algal feeders under the pack ice, (ii) dinoflagellate feeders, and (iii) diatom feeders in the open ocean. This classification was supported by the distribution of the diatom marker n-heneicosahexaene (n-C-21:6) and a general indicator of herbivory, the isoprenoid pristane. The fatty acid and hydrocarbon composition reflected dietary preferences and availability as the season progressed. Of the copepods under the pack-ice, Oithona spp. was omnivorous whereas Calanus propinquus was feeding preferentially on flagellates. Metridia gerlachei fed on flagellates in all conditions, but also included diatoms in its diet during the bloom. Calanoides acutus and Rhincalanus gigas, which passed the winter in diapause, were feeding almost exclusively on diatoms in the open ocean. Euphausia superba, which were also mainly diatom feeders in the open ocean, were feeding on the sea-ice algae (diatoms) and suspended material from the water column (dinoflagellates) under the pack-ice.

Southern Ocean biological iron cycling in the pre-whaling and present ecosystems	PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY A-MATHEMATICAL PHYSICAL AND ENGINEERING SCIENCES												This study aimed to create the first model of biological iron (Fe) cycling in the Southern Ocean food web. Two biomass mass-balanced Ecopath models were built to represent pre- and post-whaling ecosystem states (1900 and 2008). Functional group biomasses (tonnes wet weight km(-2)) were converted to biogenic Fe pools (kg Fe km-2) using published Fe content ranges. In both models, biogenic Fe pools and consumption in the pelagic Southern Ocean were highest for plankton and small nektonic groups. The production of plankton biomass, particularly unicellular groups, accounted for the highest annual Fe demand. Microzooplankton contributed most to biological Fe recycling, followed by carnivorous zooplankton and krill. Biological Fe recycling matched previous estimates, and, under most conditions, could entirely meet the Fe demand of bacterioplankton and phytoplankton. Iron recycling by large baleen whales was reduced 10-fold by whaling between 1900 and 2008. However, even under the 1900 scenario, the contribution of whales to biological Fe recycling was negligible compared with that of planktonic consumers. These models are a first step in examining oceanic-scale biological Fe cycling, highlighting gaps in our present knowledge and key questions for future research on the role of marine food webs in the cycling of trace elements in the sea. This article is part of the themed issue 'Biological and climatic impacts of ocean trace element chemistry'.

A total of 350 h search effort resulted in 342 sightings (746 animals) of 12 identified species and eight categories of unidentified cetaceans. Humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) were the most frequently sighted species in terms of number of schools and number of individuals (82 sightings:159 animals). All humpback sightings were west of 120 degrees E; distributed over a wide latitudinal band from the ice edge out to the northern limit of the survey (63 degrees S); correlated with high integrated-Chi at > 50 mu m/m(2)); and generally concentrated in the waters to the south of the Antarctic Divergence and the Southern Boundary of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC). Baleen whale distribution reflected the overall patterns of biological productivity and oceanographic processes. Most animals were found to the west of 120 degrees E and to the south of the Southern Boundary of the ACC (which lies well offshore in this region) and the Antarctic Divergence, which coincided with the ACC between 85 and 135 degrees E on this survey. The large-scale patterns observed in this survey indicate that baleen whale species in the Southern Ocean may be concentrated in areas where extensive winter sea-ice cover and oceanographic features allow extended residence time in surface waters for primary producers during the Austral summer ice retreat. Odontocete species were less abundant and generally concentrated at meso-scale high-productivity areas produced by the interactions of identifiable physical features, (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

J	Jenouvrier, S; Peron, C; Weimerskirch, H				Jenouvrier, Stephanie; Peron, Clara; Weimerskirch, Henri			Extreme climate events and individual heterogeneity shape life-history traits and population dynamics	ECOLOGICAL MONOGRAPHS												Extreme climatic conditions and their ecological impacts are currently emerging as critical features of climate change. We studied extreme sea ice condition (ESIC) and found it impacts both life-history traits and population dynamics of an Antarctic seabird well beyond ordinary variability. The Southern Fulmar (Fulmarus glacialoides) is an ice-dependent seabird, and individuals forage near the ice edge. During an extreme unfavorable year (when sea ice area is reduced and distance between ice edge and colony is high), observed foraging trips were greater in distance and duration. As a result, adults brought less food to their chicks, which fledged in the poorest body condition. During such unfavorable years, breeding success was extremely low and population growth rate () was greatly reduced. The opposite pattern occurred during extreme favorable years. Previous breeding status had a strong influence on life-history traits and population dynamics, and their responses to extreme conditions. Successful breeders had a higher chance of breeding and raising their chick successfully during the following breeding season as compared to other breeding stages, regardless of environmental conditions. Consequently, they coped better with unfavorable ESIC. The effect of change in successful breeder vital rates on was greater than for other stages' vital rates, except for pre-breeder recruitment probabilities, which most affected . For environments characterized by ordinary sea ice conditions, interindividual differences were more likely to persist over the life of individuals and randomness in individual pathways was low, suggesting individual heterogeneity in vital rates arising from innate or acquired phenotypic traits. Additionally, unfavorable ESIC tended to exacerbate individual differences in intrinsic quality, expressed through differences in reproductive status. We discuss the strong effects of ESIC on Southern Fulmar life-history traits in an evolutionary context. ESICs strongly affect fitness components and act as potentially important agents of natural selection of life histories related to intrinsic quality and intermittent breeding. In addition, recruitment is a highly plastic trait that, if heritable, could have a critical role in evolution of life histories. Finally, we find that changes in the frequency of extreme events may strongly impact persistence of Southern Fulmar populations.

J	Berrow, SD; Wood, AR; Prince, PA				Berrow, SD; Wood, AR; Prince, PA			Foraging location and range of White-chinned Petrels Procellaria aequinoctialis breeding in the South Atlantic	JOURNAL OF AVIAN BIOLOGY												The foraging range and principal feeding areas of White-chinned Petrels breeding at South Georgia were determined using satellite telemetry. Foraging trips during incubation lasted 12-15 days and covered 3000-8000 km and 2-11 days and 1100-5900 km during chick-rearing. Adults covered less distance per day during chick-rearing (71 km) than during incubation (91 km) but the proportion covered at night (47%) was the same. Mean (31-34 km/h) and maximum (80 km/h) flight velocities were similar during both periods of the breeding season and during day and night. Between incubation shifts, White-chinned Petrels travelled to the Patagonian shelf during chick-rearing they foraged more extensively. Most locations were between 30 degrees to 55 degrees W and 52 degrees to 60 degrees W around South Georgia/Shag Rocks and south to the South Orkney Islands. Diet samples from known foraging locations suggested birds fed mainly on krill and squid. They caught the squid Brachioteuthis? picta and Galiteuthis glacialis around Shag Rocks/South Georgia and also at sites close to the South Orkney Islands: Illex argentinus on the Patagonian shelf. Dispersal of adults after breeding failure was south to the South Orkney Islands then west to the Falkland Islands. This study confirms that breeding White-chinned Petrels are amongst the widest-ranging of seabirds; they may minimise competition with other Procellariiformes in the South Atlantic by their more extensive foraging range. The nature and extent of their range also brings substantial risk of high mortality rate in South Atlantic long-line fisheries.																	0908-8857	1600-048X				SEP	2000	31	3					303	311		10.1034/j.1600-048X.2000.310305.x							WOS:000089783300005

Two free-drifting icebergs, 0.1 and 30.8 square kilometers in aerial surface area, and the surrounding waters were sampled in the northwest Weddell Sea during austral spring 2005. There was substantial enrichment of terrigenous material, and there were high concentrations of chlorophyll, krill, and seabirds surrounding each iceberg, extending out to a radial distance of similar to 3.7 kilometers. Extrapolating these results to all icebergs in the same size range, with the use of iceberg population estimates from satellite surveys, indicates that they similarly affect 39% of the surface ocean in this region. These results suggest that free-drifting icebergs can substantially affect the pelagic ecosystem of the Southern Ocean and can serve as areas of enhanced production and sequestration of organic carbon to the deep sea.

Cumulative solar irradiance and potential large-scale sea ice algae distribution off East Antarctica (30A degrees E-150A degrees E)	POLAR BIOLOGY												We present a computational model of the large-scale cumulative light exposure of sea ice in the Southern Ocean off East Antarctica (30A degrees E-150A degrees E). The model uses remotely sensed or modelled sea ice concentration, snow depth over sea ice, and solar irradiance data, and tracks sea ice motion over the season of interest in order to calculate the cumulative exposure of the ice field to photosynthetically active radiation (PAR). Light is the limiting factor to sea ice algal growth over winter and early spring, and so the results have implications for the estimation of algal biomass in East Antarctica. The model results indicate that highly light-exposed ice is restricted to within a few degrees of the coast in the eastern part of the study region, but extends much further north in the 30A degrees E-100A degrees E sector. The relative influences of sea ice motion, solar flux, and snow depth variations on interannual variations in model predictions were evaluated. The model estimates of cumulative PAR were found to correlate with satellite estimates of subsequent open-water chlorophyll-a concentration, consistent with the notion that sea ice algae can provide inocula for phytoplankton blooms.																	0722-4060	1432-2056				MAR	2009	32	3					443	452		10.1007/s00300-008-0538-5							WOS:000263389000013

Feeding behavior of the ctenophore Thalassocalyce inconstans: revision of anatomy of the order Thalassocalycida	MARINE BIOLOGY												Behavioral observations using a remotely operated vehicle (ROV) in the Gulf of California in March, 2003, provided insights into the vertical distribution, feeding and anatomy of the rare and delicate ctenophore Thalassocalyce inconstans. Additional archived ROV video records from the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute of 288 sightings of T. inconstans and 2,437 individual observations of euphausiids in the Gulf of California and Monterey Canyon between 1989 and 2005 were examined to determine ctenophore and euphausiid prey depth distributions with respect to temperature and dissolved oxygen concentration [dO]. In the Gulf of California most ctenophores (96.9%) were above 350 m, the top of the oxygen minimum layer. In Monterey Canyon the ctenophores were more widely distributed throughout the water column, including the hypoxic zone, to depths as great as 3,500 m. Computer-aided behavioral analysis of two video records of the capture of euphausiids by T. inconstans showed that the ctenophore contracted its bell almost instantly (0.5 s), transforming its flattened, hemispherical resting shape into a closed bi-lobed globe in which seawater and prey were engulfed. Euphausiids entrapped within the globe displayed a previously undescribed escape response for krill ('probing behavior'), in which they hovered and gently probed the inner surfaces of the globe with antennae without stimulating further contraction by the ctenophore. Such rapid bell contraction could be effected only by a peripheral sphincter muscle even though the presence of circumferential ring musculature was unknown for the Phylum Ctenophora. Thereafter, several live T. inconstans were collected by hand off Barbados and microscopic observations confirmed that assumption.																	0025-3162					APR	2009	156	5					1049	1056		10.1007/s00227-009-1149-6							WOS:000263829900020						
J	Ward, P; Atkinson, A; Tarling, G				Ward, Peter; Atkinson, Angus; Tarling, Geraint			Mesozooplankton community structure and variability in the Scotia Sea: A seasonal comparison	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY												Mesozooplankton distribution and community structure was investigated during 3 cruises to the Scotia Sea in austral spring, summer and autumn. Three mesh sizes of Bongo nets were used during each cruise with a 53 mu m mesh net yielding on average 1.76 times higher densities (median 923,000 ind. m(-2), 0-400 m) than a 100 mu m net and 7.42 times more than a 200 mu m net across all cruises. Small copepods dominated numerically across all nets with Oithona spp., Oncaea spp., Ctenocalanus citer and Microcalanus pygmaeus being particularly abundant, with sample densities of up to 3.5 x 10(6) ind.m(-2) recorded within the top 400 m. A more even distribution of biomass among net sizes was apparent, with median net ratios (1.15-1.25) smaller and more even than for abundance. To the south of the Scotia Sea plankton maxima occurred in autumn, consistent with a later spawning in many species, whereas further north, abundance in 53 and 100 mu m nets varied little across seasons, although in the 200 mu m net there was a clear summer maximum. Median biomass increased through summer and by autumn was twice than found during spring in all parts of the Scotia Sea. Cluster analysis indicated two main station groups in all 3 seasons. To the south of the Southern boundary of the ACC (SB-ACC), Group 1 contained stations, that lay within the seasonal sea-ice zone and where zooplankton abundance and biomass was persistently low. In contrast at Group 2 stations, north of the Southern Antarctic Circumpolar Current Front (SACCF) abundance and biomass was consistently higher. Differences between the two groups were largely apparent at the population rather than at the taxonomic level. LHPR hauls to 1000 m indicated that the large seasonal migrant copepods Calanoides acutus and Rhincalanus gigas were at a more advanced stage of development in the north in spring and summer where they were generally present in the upper water column. In autumn, at all stations, C. acutus was dominated by later stages and was dispersed throughout the water column. Calanus simillimus was only abundant at Group 2 stations with older stages dominant in spring and autumn and younger stages in summer. The influence of environmental factors such as sea-ice, temperature and chlorophyll a biomass (Chl a) which may have influenced the development and seasonal succession of zooplankton populations, is briefly discussed.

Nine species of euphausiids occurred in the survey area. Among them, Euphausia triacantha was dominant in biomass north of the southern boundary of the Antarctic circumpolar current (SB). Thysanoessa spp. was widely distributed north of the continental slope, while E. superba was distributed from the SB to the slope, where it showed the highest biomass. Juvenile E. superba was distributed offshore near the SB and remained at the surface, but gravid females were dominant in the slope and mainly occurred in the middle layers (400-600 m). Adult and juvenile E. crystallorophias were found at 200-300 m in the colder water of the continental shelf. In general, the peak biomass of euphausiids was found in the mid layers of the Ross Sea area. The life span and the number of spawns for major species are also discussed.																	0722-4060	1432-2056				OCT	2008	31	11					1343	1356		10.1007/s00300-008-0472-6							WOS:000260286400006

Adelie penguin dietary remains reveal Holocene environmental changes in the western Ross Sea (Antarctica)	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY												Carbon and nitrogen stable isotope analyses were performed on modern and Holocene Adelie penguin guano samples collected from ornithogenic soils along the Scott Coast (Southern Victoria Land, Antarctica), from Cape Irizar to Dunlop Island, and at Cape Bird (Ross Island). Guano samples also were sieved and sorted under stereomicroscope in order to select penguin dietary remains, such as fish bones and otoliths. Carbon and nitrogen stable isotope composition, coupled with the taxonomic identification of fish otoliths from Scott Coast Holocene samples, indicated a mainly fish-based diet for this area, with Pleuragramma antarcticum as the most eaten prey throughout the investigated period (from 390 cal BP to ca 7300 cal BP). The isotopic values of Ross Island samples (from modern to 3850 cal BP) showed a krill consumption increase in the samples younger than 2000 cal BP, with the maximum in modern samples. Scott Coast and Ross Island Holocene samples showed delta C-13 and delta N-15 trends similar to those previously published from Terra Nova Bay (northern Victoria Land), whereas modem samples from Ross Island have similar delta N-15 composition but different delta C-13 values. This delta C-13 divergence started at ca 2000 BP and follows the abandonment of the Scott Coast colonies. The delta C-13 trend observed in Ross Island and Terra Nova Bay samples and the abandonment of the Scott Coast colonies could suggest the stability and the persistence of the previous oceanographic conditions (i.e. polynya) for the Terra Nova Bay area and the establishment of new conditions for water circulation in the Southern Ross Sea since similar to 2000 BP when persistent sea-ice sealed the Scott Coast.

J	Waugh, CA; Nichols, PD; Noad, MC; Nash, SB				Waugh, Courtney A.; Nichols, Peter D.; Noad, Michael C.; Nash, Susan Bengtson			Lipid and fatty acid profiles of migrating Southern Hemisphere humpback whales Megaptera novaeangliae	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												The lipid and fatty acid (FA) composition of the outer blubber layer was characterized in 46 east Australian migrating humpback whales Megaptera novaeangliae. Samples were obtained at 2 time points of the annual migration, which occurs between Antarctic feeding grounds and low-latitude breeding grounds and is associated with a prolonged period of fasting. Blubber lipid composition was dominated by triacylglycerols in all individuals, and the FA profiles of both migration cohorts and sexes were dominated by monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA). Results indicate that males primarily mobilise polyunsaturated fatty acids in response to migration and fasting, favouring the most readily utilisable FA as governed by their physicochemical properties. In comparison, females appear to initially mobilise short-chain (<18 carbons) MUFA stores, potentially to attend to dependent calves' thermoregulatory needs. Feeding ecology investigations suggested that humpback whales have a species-specific FA composition of their blubber, including a detectable influence of their diet. This study provides the first insight into lipid and FA profiles of Southern Hemisphere humpback whales. A comprehensive understanding of FA dynamics, especially during times of energy deficit, is essential for understanding the nutritional status of Southern Hemisphere humpback whales and thereby the risks posed by growing environmental threats including toxic and persistent lipophilic pollutants.

Neural mechanism of optimal limb coordination in crustacean swimming	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA												A fundamental challenge in neuroscience is to understand how biologically salient motor behaviors emerge from properties of the underlying neural circuits. Crayfish, krill, prawns, lobsters, and other long-tailed crustaceans swim by rhythmically moving limbs called swimmerets. Over the entire biological range of animal size and paddling frequency, movements of adjacent swimmerets maintain an approximate quarter-period phase difference with the more posterior limbs leading the cycle. We use a computational fluid dynamics model to show that this frequency-invariant stroke pattern is the most effective and mechanically efficient paddling rhythm across the full range of biologically relevant Reynolds numbers in crustacean swimming. We then show that the organization of the neural circuit underlying swimmeret coordination provides a robust mechanism for generating this stroke pattern. Specifically, the wave-like limb coordination emerges robustly from a combination of the half-center structure of the local central pattern generating circuits (CPGs) that drive the movements of each limb, the asymmetric network topology of the connections between local CPGs, and the phase response properties of the local CPGs, which we measure experimentally. Thus, the crustacean swimmeret system serves as a concrete example in which the architecture of a neural circuit leads to optimal behavior in a robust manner. Furthermore, we consider all possible connection topologies between local CPGs and show that the natural connectivity pattern generates the biomechanically optimal stroke pattern most robustly. Given the high metabolic cost of crustacean swimming, our results suggest that natural selection has pushed the swimmeret neural circuit toward a connection topology that produces optimal behavior.

At Ocean Station P, although a number of zooplankton species are large enough to generate turbulence with Reynolds numbers Re. 1000, biomass densities are typically less than 10(3) individuals per cubic meter (<0.01% by volume), and turbulent kinetic energy dissipation rates epsilon were better correlated with 16-m vertical shear than acoustic backscatter layers. In Saanich Inlet, where krill densities are up to 10(4) individuals per cubic meter (0.1% by volume), no dramatic elevation of dissipation rates epsilon was associated with dusk and dawn vertical migrations of the acoustic backscatter layer. Dissipation rates are a factor of 2 higher [<epsilon > = 1.4 x 10 (8) W kg (1), corresponding to buoyancy Re = <epsilon >/(nu N-2) similar to 140] in acoustic backscatter layers than in acoustically quiet waters, regardless of whether they are vertically migrating. The O(1 m) thick turbulence patches have vertical wavenumber spectra for microscale shear commensurate with the Nasmyth model turbulence spectrum. However, the turbulence bursts of O(10(-5) W kg(-1)) proposed to occur in such dense swarms appear to be rare. Thus far, intense turbulent bursts have been found infrequently, even in very dense aggregations O(10(4) individuals per cubic meter) characteristic of coastal and high-latitude environs. Based on sampling to date, this corresponds to a frequency of occurrence of less than 4%, suggesting that turbulence production by the marine biosphere is not efficient.																	0022-3670	1520-0485				SEP	2010	40	9					2107	2121		10.1175/2010JPO4415.1							WOS:000282198900011						
J	Barnes, DKA				Barnes, DKA			Competition asymmetry with taxon divergence	PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES												Most organisms experience competition for resources, probably most of the time. As the structure and requirements of closely related species are generally liable to be more similar than in distantly linked species, Darwin suggested that the potential for competition was greater in the former. Since that time, studies have concentrated on interactions of either conspecifics or congeneric species. Shared critical resources, which organisms compete for, are generally mates, food and space (for access to the former). Whilst mates are valued only within species, in that the definition of a species requires it so, both food and space have the potential to be shared by very different organisms. It is now clear that vertebrates may compete with remotely related species: e.g. with squid for krill and with insects for nectar or seeds. Diamond suggested that (i) mutual aggression, (ii) displacement and (iii) evolutionary change in morphology would be increasingly asymmetric with competitor dissimilarity. Thus, with increasing taxonomic distance between two competitors (A and B), increasing aggression is exhibited between them and, increasingly, one consistently displaces the other. Here, Darwin's suggestion and Diamond's first two theories are tested across a taxonomic spectrum for the first time to the best of the author's knowledge. The proportion of spatial competitors in two different marine invertebrate groups demonstrating mutual aggression and displacement increases with taxon divergence (Nei's genetic identity). Congenerics were twice as likely to fight as conspecifics, and confamilial competitors were three times as likely to fight as conspecifics. This relationship seems robust to taxonomic and environmental variability. Competitors do not need to be as distant as birds and bees for complete asymmetry, a different family seems sufficient.																	0962-8452					MAR 22	2003	270	1515					557	562		10.1098/rspb.2002.2274							WOS:000181769800001	12769453

Samples were taken from the water column, the ice. In water interface and the sea ice. In winter (August 1986) S. longipes copepodite stage ClV occurred mainly in the upper water layers of the ice covered eastern Weddell Sea, while only naupliiwere found in the sea ice. In late winter/early spring (October-December 1986) very low numbers of S. longipes were found in the water column, mainly in the upper 50m, but high numbers occurred immediately below and within the sea ice. Adults dominated in the water column and in the under ice water layer while the sea ice contained nauplii and copepodite stage CI. During summer (January/February 1985) the eastern Weddell Sea was almost entirely free of ice with the exception of fast ice fields at the ice shelf. During this time S. longipes was concentrated in the upper 50m of the water column and in the ice/water interface where an ice cover was present. Young copepodite stages (CI-CIII) comprised the largest fraction of the population. In autumn (April/May 1992) as new ice began to develop, S. longipes, dominated by copepodite stage CIV, occurred in greatest number within mid-water layers. The abundance of S. longipes in autumn was similar to late winter/early spring highest in the sea ice and lowest in the water column. During all periods of investigation the population structure differed between the various habitats with the youngest population occurring in the sea ice and the oldest in the water column. A younger generation of the S. longipes population appears to overwinter in the sea ice and ice/water interface and an older one in deeper water layers or near the bottom.

J	Olsen, Y				Olsen, Yngvar			Resources for fish feed in future mariculture	AQUACULTURE ENVIRONMENT INTERACTIONS												There is a growing concern about the ability to produce enough nutritious food to feed the global human population in this century. Environmental conflicts and a limited freshwater supply constrain further developments in agriculture; global fisheries have levelled off, and aquaculture may have to play a more prominent role in supplying human food. Freshwater is important, but it is also a major challenge to cultivate the oceans in an environmentally, economically and energy-friendly way. To support this, a long-term vision must be to derive new sources of feed, primarily taken from outside the human food chain, and to move carnivore production to a lower trophic level. The main aim of this paper is to speculate on how feed supplies can be produced for an expanding aquaculture industry by and beyond 2050 and to establish a roadmap of the actions needed to achieve this. Resources from agriculture, fish meal and fish oil are the major components of pellet fish feeds. All cultured animals take advantage of a certain fraction of fish meal in the feed, and marine carnivores depend on a supply of marine lipids containing highly unsaturated fatty acids (HUFA, with >= 3 double bonds and >= 20 carbon chain length) in the feed. The availability of HUFA is likely the main constraint for developing carnivore aquaculture in the next decades. The availability of fish meal and oil will decrease, and the competition for plant products will increase. New harvested resources are herbivore zooplankton, such as Antarctic krill and red feed, and new produced resources are macro-algae, transgenic higher HUFA-producing plants and bacterial biomass. These products are to a limited extent components of the human food chain, and all these resources will help to move cultured carnivores to lower trophic levels and can thereby increase the production capacity and the sustainability of the production. Mariculture can only become as successful as agriculture in the coming century if carnivores can be produced at around Trophic Level 2, based mainly on plant resources. There is little potential for increasing the traditional fish meal food chain in aquaculture.																	1869-215X	1869-7534					2011	1	3					187	200		10.3354/aei00019							WOS:000292314200002

Global Seabird Response to Forage Fish Depletion-One-Third for the Birds	SCIENCE												Determining the form of key predator-prey relationships is critical for understanding marine ecosystem dynamics. Using a comprehensive global database, we quantified the effect of fluctuations in food abundance on seabird breeding success. We identified a threshold in prey (fish and krill, termed "forage fish") abundance below which seabirds experience consistently reduced and more variable productivity. This response was common to all seven ecosystems and 14 bird species examined within the Atlantic, Pacific, and Southern Oceans. The threshold approximated one-third of the maximum prey biomass observed in long-term studies. This provides an indicator of the minimal forage fish biomass needed to sustain seabird productivity over the long term.

Samples were collected in October/November 1988 with a multiple RMT1 + 8 net during the European Polarstern Study (EPOS). Multivariate analysis resulted in two distinct site clusters, a northern one mainly located in the open water/marginal ice zone and a southern one extending from the marginal ice zone into the consolidated pack-ice. Clusters were, however, faunistically coherent with a high degree in positive covariation of species. There was no basis for the separation into communities, but differences occurred on the population level in numerical abundances, biomass (wet weight) and in a shift in species dominance. Different ice zones and vertical layers were tested among each other with regard to their relative species abundance. Significant differences were found between the upper 60 m layer of the open sea, the upper 60 m layer of the closed pack-ice and the so called transitional zone. Species richness and diversity was lowest directly under the closed pack-ice. Abundance and biomass was highest in the surface layer of the open water, while both variables decreased dramatically under the ice. Copepods dominated numerically in open water, while salps dominated in biomass. Euphausia superba and Thysanoessa macrura were the dominant species in the upper water column of the closed pack-ice zone. Krill was the only species with increasing abundance in the sub-ice area and a dominance in biomass of more than 91% demonstrated its unique importance for the sub-ice habitat.																	0722-4060					APR	1992	12	1					15	24									WOS:A1992HT73100003

High-resolution modelling of the shelf and open ocean adjacent to South Georgia, Southern Ocean	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY												The marine ecosystem on the shelf and open ocean adjacent to South Georgia is extraordinarily rich, with a history of commercial exploitation. Although much progress has been made, attempts at modelling (and hence better understanding) this system have consistently been hampered by the poor representation of key physical processes in global or regional ocean general circulation models. Here we present the development of a high-resolution 3D hydrodynamic model of the South Georgia shelf and the adjacent open ocean, including a novel method for prescribing freshwater fluxes. The ability of the model to reproduce the observed oceanography of the region is quantified by comparisons with data from tide gauges at South Georgia, with satellite-derived sea surface temperatures, and with an extensive CTD dataset collected during January-April 1995. Predicted cotidal charts for the diurnal tides O-1 and K-1 show a periodic amplification in both the current and elevation fields at the shelf edge, suggesting the presence of a diurnally forced continental shelf wave. This could have important implications for processes such as larval transport and retention. The comparison with CTD data reveals mean and root mean square errors in temperature (salinity) of -0.27 degrees C (-0.07) and 0.64 degrees C (0.23), respectively. Vertical profiles of potential temperature and salinity on the shelf agree acceptably well with observations, but there is a tendency for the model to under-predict the density contrast between surface and bottom waters. The main limitation on model accuracy is found to be the large-scale forcing. Releasing a passive tracer into the model, transport and retention pathways are identified, including a prevalence for tracer export from the shelf to the west of South Georgia, and a transport pathway linking South Georgia and Shag Rocks. Significantly, the model suggests this to be a unidirectional link, from South Georgia to Shag Rocks, with possible significance for fisheries management. The implications of these results in the context of the South Georgia ecosystem are discussed briefly, demonstrating the usefulness of this new tool for interdisciplinary studies of the region.

Exploring the association between whole blood Omega-3 Index, DHA, EPA, DHA, AA and n-6 DPA, and depression and self-esteem in adolescents of lower general secondary education	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NUTRITION												PurposeDepression is common in adolescents and long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFA) are suggested to be associated with depression. However, research in adolescents is limited. Furthermore, self-esteem has never been studied in relation to LCPUFA. The objective here was to determine associations of depression and self-esteem with eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), Omega-3 Index (O3I), n-6 docosapentaenoic acid (n-6 DPA, also called Osbond acid, ObA), n-3 docosapentaenoic acid (DPA), and arachidonic acid (AA) concentrations in blood of adolescents attending lower general secondary education (LGSE).MethodsBaseline cross-sectional data from a krill oil supplementation trial in adolescents attending LGSE with an O3I5% were analysed using regression models built with the BayesFactor package in R. Fatty acids and O3I were determined in blood. Participants filled out the Centre for Epidemiologic Studies Depression (CES-D) scale and the Rosenberg Self-Esteem scale (RSE).ResultsScores indicative of depression (CES-D16) were found in 29.4% of the respondents. Of all fatty acids, we found extreme evidence [Bayes factor (BF)>100] for a weak negative association between ObA and depression score [-0.16; 95% credible interval (CI) -0.28 to -0.04; BF10=245], and substantial evidence for a weak positive association between ObA and self-esteem score (0.09; 95% CI, -0.03 to 0.20; BF10=4). When all fatty acids were put in one model as predictors of CES-D or RSE, all of the 95% CI contained 0, i.e., no significant association.ConclusionNo evidence was found for associations of DHA, EPA and O3I with depression or self-esteem scores in LGSE adolescents with O3I5%. The associations of higher ObA status with lower depression and higher self-esteem scores warrant more research.

A prey-related shift in the abundance of small pelagic fish in eastern Tasmania?	ICES JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE												Shifts in the relative abundance of small pelagic fish species have signalled a change in the ocean environment in a number of locations. Here we show that the replacement of jack mackerel, Trachurus declivis, with redbait, Emmelichthys nitidus, as the dominant small pelagic species from eastern Tasmania, following a period of high fishing pressure on jack mackerel, is consistent with altered zooplankton communities and long- term climate change. Stomach contents analysis and morphology measurements were conducted on both species to determine if they were functionally equivalent with regard to zooplankton prey. Diet varied between species and with fish size. Krill (Nyctiphanes australis) was consumed by both species, with redbait feeding more heavily on small copepods. The diet overlap and morphometric characteristics indicated that these species are not equivalent with regard to prey and therefore changes in prey availability may have contributed to the observed shifts in relative abundance. The continued poleward extension of the East Australian Current is expected to favour small warm- water copepods; thus, redbait may have an advantage over jack mackerel due to prey preferences. An increase in relative abundance of redbait has decreased effort in surface fisheries and may impact on surface- feeding higher predators in this region.

A diet with 3% fishmeal was supplemented with either 3% salmon meal (POS), 3% soy protein concentrate (NEG), 3% krill meal (KRM), 3% squid meal (SQM), 3% shrimp head meal (SHM), 3% shrimp meal (SM), 3% squid liver meal (SLM), or 5% liquid sardine hydrolysate (SAH). Shrimp with a body weight (BW) of 0.99 +/- 0.08 g were stocked at 100 animals/m(2) in 56 tanks of 1 m(3) and fed 10 times daily for 74 days. Feed preference was evaluated by feeding shrimp of 10.87 +/- 1.82 g in excess twice a day for 10 days in two separate feeding trays allocated in 50 tanks of 0.5 m(3). Survival reached 93.3 +/- 5.80% and was unaffected by supplementation. Final BW was the highest for shrimp fed the KRM-supplemented diet (11.97 +/- 0.93 g), followed by POS (11.11 +/- 0.77 g) and SQM (11.01 +/- 1.17 g). Diets SHM, SM, SLM, and NEG showed a lower shrimp BW than POS, but were not statistically different among them. Shrimp fed the SAH diet achieved the lowest BW (10.06 +/- 1.02 g). The highest gained yield was obtained with diets KRM and POS. No statistical difference was observed in shrimp yield among other diets. The lowest feed conversion ratio (FCR) was achieved with shrimp fed KRM (1.31 +/- 0.05) when compared to diets SHM (1.47 +/- 0.05), SAH (1.47 +/- 0.07), and SLM (1.45 +/- 0.17). Two-by-two comparisons indicated that shrimp preferred SHM and KRM, except when these were compared to SQM and SLM. No difference in feed preference was found between diets with SQM and SLM. SAH was the least preferred raw material in all comparisons. Results indicated that KRM acts as a powerful feeding effector and growth enhancer in fishmeal-challenged diets for whiteleg shrimp. A dietary supplementation with 3% KRM is more effective than the same dose of any other chemoattractant evaluated.

Pattern of Mercury Allocation into Egg Components is Independent of Dietary Exposure in Gentoo Penguins	ARCHIVES OF ENVIRONMENTAL CONTAMINATION AND TOXICOLOGY												Avian eggs have become one of the most common means of evaluating mercury contamination in aquatic and marine environments and can serve as reliable indicators of dietary mercury exposure. We investigated patterns of mercury deposition into the major components of penguin eggs (shell, membrane, albumen, and yolk) using the Gentoo penguin (Pygoscelis papua) as a model species. Eggs were collected from both wild and captive populations of Gentoo penguins to compare the allocation of mercury into individual egg components of birds feeding at disparate trophic positions as inferred by stable isotope analysis. Mercury concentrations in captive penguins were an order of magnitude higher than in wild birds, presumably because the former were fed only fish at a higher trophic position relative to wild penguins that fed on a diet of 72-93% krill (Euphausia spp.). Similar to previous studies, we found the majority of total egg mercury sequestered in the albumen (92%) followed by the yolk (6.7%) with the lowest amounts in the shell (0.9%) and membrane (0.4%). Regardless of dietary exposure, mercury concentrations in yolk and membrane, and to a lesser degree shell, increased with increasing albumen mercury (used as a proxy for whole-egg mercury), indicating that any component, in the absence of others, may be suitable for monitoring changes in dietary mercury. Because accessibility of egg tissues in the wild varies, the establishment of consistent relationships among egg components will facilitate comparisons with any other study using eggs to assess dietary exposure to mercury.

The diet comprised a large variety of prey, mainly fish, crustaceans and squid. In contrast to other species of the blue-eyed shag complex, prey not only consisted of benthic organisms but also included pelagic prey. Different sampling techniques were combined in order to obtain a comprehensive overview of the diet. Pellets, regurgitations and stomach contents yielded different results. We discuss the causes for these variations including different sample availability over time. In particular, the stomach analyses seem to overestimate the importance of squid based on the occurrence of squid beaks. For the pellet analyses, lobster krill accounted for the majority of the prey remains except during the second half of December (i.e. when young chicks were being attended), when fish was more important.

A 50-year retrospective of persistent organic pollutants in the fat and eggs of penguins of the Southern Ocean	ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION												Persistent organic pollutants (POPS) such as dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethanes (DDTs), hexachlorobenzene (HCB), hexachlorocyclohexanes (HCHs), and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) have been spreading to Antarctica for over half a century. Penguins are effective indicators of pelagic concentrations of POPs. We synthesized the literature on penguins to assess temporal trends of pelagic contamination in Antarctica, using fat and eggs to monitor changes from 1964 to 2011. DDT/DDE ratios suggest long-range atmospheric transport. Average DDT in fat (ww) increased from 44 ng g(-1), in the 1960s, peaked at 171 ng g(-1) in the mid-1980s, and then declined slowly to the present level of 101 ng g(-1). Temporal trends in HCB contamination rose into the 1990s before declining. Sigma HCHs in fat was similar to 5 ng g(-1) from 1960 to 1979, peaking at 33 ng g(-1) during the period 1980-1989 before declining to similar to 5 ng g(-1), from 1990 to present. PCBs rose substantially from 1970 to 2009 in fat, varying more than DDTs and HCB in both fat and eggs. Antarctic penguins are good biological indicators of global DDT and HCB emissions, but the existing data are insufficient regarding HCHs and PCBs. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Guihen, D				Guihen, Damien			High-resolution acoustic surveys with diving gliders come at a cost of aliasing moving targets	PLOS ONE												Underwater gliders are autonomous robots that follow a slow, see-saw path and may be deployed for months on end. Gliders have a dramatically lower payload capacity than research vessels and are thus limited to more simple instrumentation. They have the advantage, however, of being deployable for long periods of time without the high running costs of a ship. Recent years have seen development of the use of gliders to undertake acoustic surveys of biomass in the pelagic environment, highlighting their potential to fill future survey gaps. Here it is shown, using simulation of sampling, that gliders can resolve acoustic targets at greater resolutions than ships, due to their diving pattern, but that survey accuracy is strongly dependent on the speed of the target.

Latitudinal, ontogenetic, and historical shifts in the diet of a carnivorous teleost, Arripis trutta, in a coastal pelagic ecosystem altered by climate change	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												Changes to the global climate are driving alterations to boundary current-influenced marine ecosystems. The diet of a pelagic teleost, Arripis trutta, was examined in the East Australian Current (EAC)-dominated coastal waters of southeastern (SE) Australia. The diet of A. trutta was dominated by pelagic baitfish, primarily Australian sardine (Sardinops sagax) and scads (Trachurus spp.). Diet varied substantially with both latitude and season linked to variability in the distribution and abundance of key prey species. An ontogenetic diet shift occurred, with crustaceans and polychaetes making up a large proportion of the diet of small fish compared with the dominance of baitfish at larger sizes. The diet of A. trutta has undergone a dramatic shift from one dominated by krill (Nyctiphanes australis) historically to baitfish today. This change is consistent with a well-documented regime shift caused by the increasing intensity of the EAC on coastal SE Australian waters. Understanding the temporal dynamics of this ecosystem is crucial for management of coastal fisheries and also for understanding the impacts of climate change on boundary current-dominated marine ecosystems worldwide.

J	Clausen, A; Putz, K				Clausen, A; Putz, K			Winter diet and foraging range of gentoo penguins (Pygoscelis papua) from Kidney Cove, Falkland Islands	POLAR BIOLOGY												The winter diet and foraging range of gentoo penguins, Pygoscelis Papua, were studied at Kidney Cove, Falkland Islands. The mean wet mass of the 56 stomach-content samples collected from May to October was 32.7+/-47.4 g. The diet consisted generally of cephalopods, crustaceans and fish, as well as two other molluscs. Among the six cephalopod species identified, the commercially fished Patagonian squid, Loligo gahi, had the highest abundance and was also the main prey by reconstituted mass (53% of the total reconstituted mass). Lobster krill, Munida gregaria, one of five species of crustaceans, was the most abundant prey species by frequency of occurrence and by number (68% and 60%, respectively). Rock cod, Patagonotothen ramsayi, accounted for the majority of the fish diet with 34% of the total reconstituted mass. Most prey species identified in the winter diet were also abundant diet components during the breeding season. However, the known biology of the prey species and their rate of digestion indicated that, in winter, adults may forage further offshore than during the breeding season. This assumption was supported by the results obtained from two birds satellite-tracked during the study period. Both birds remained mainly in inshore waters and returned frequently ashore, but one penguin foraged up to 276 km from the coast. The differences in the foraging behaviour of the two birds were reflected in significant differences with regard to time spent underwater, distance travelled per day and calculated travelling speed. Furthermore, the progress of cohorts of L. gahi over the winter is consistent with results from life-cycle studies in this region and suggests that birds have been foraging in the feeding grounds of L. gahi.

Trophic mediation and ecosystem stability: An assessment using qualitative network models	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Nontrophic interactions can contribute to negative and positive feedbacks within a community, thus affecting likelihood of regime shifts; however, assessing the nature and importance of these effects in a network remains challenging, especially for pelagic ecosystems. Here, we present a qualitative modeling approach for assessing the importance of different effects and resultant feedbacks for community stability, using a Southern Ocean example. A potentially important positive feedback in the Southern Ocean ecosystem involves production of a chemical cue, dimethyl sulfide (DMS), by some phytoplankton. Production of DMS can promote phytoplankton growth by attracting predators of phytoplankton-grazers, and nutrients released as feces from those predators help fertilize the water column. We explored how uncertainties in the nature of this feedback affect community stability in a set of small, community models. We found that stability varied substantially depending on how the community was modeled, but that the interactions most important for determining stability were consistent across all models. Model stability was sensitive to the strength of phytoplankton competition, controls on phytoplankton, DMS production and release, and predator attraction to DMS, suggesting that the community could be destabilized by perturbation affecting these interactions. Incorporating DMS-mediated feedbacks into a larger Southern Ocean network had a moderate impact on stability characteristics and altered the trophic level at which the system would be most vulnerable to perturbation.

J	Hofman, RJ				Hofman, Robert J.			Stopping overexploitation of living resources on the high seas	MARINE POLICY												This paper reviews the provisions and efforts to implement the 1946 International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling (ICRW) and the 1980 Convention on the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR). It illustrates progress and continuing challenges to stopping the overexploitation of living resources in high seas areas beyond national jurisdictions. Progress includes recognition that living organisms interact with each other and the environment in complex ways and that single-species management to attain maximum sustainable yield (MSY) fails to account for these interactions. Continuing challenges include data limitations that allow differing views concerning the adequacy and interpretation of the available data, and decision-making that allows a minority of the decision-makers to block adoption of regulatory measures that the majority believe necessary to meet the intent and provisions of the regulatory agreements. The provisions and continuing challenges to meeting the objectives of these two conventions should be considered in the formulation of future international high seas regulatory agreements such as the regime to govern fisheries in the central Artic Ocean as envisioned in the 16 year ban on commercial fishing there agreed in October 2018 by Canada, Denmark (for Greenland), Iceland, Russia, Norway, the United States, the European Union, Japan, China, and South Korea.																	0308-597X	1872-9460				MAY	2019	103						91	100		10.1016/j.marpol.2019.02.037							WOS:000463125700012

Investigations of intra-seasonal variation in foraging habitat will, therefore, provide clues to understand how predators respond to changes in the marine environment. As an abundant, central-place foraging mesopredator, we selected to examine this with Adelie penguins (Pygoscelis adeliae) breeding in the Prydz Bay region where the sea-ice environment is heterogeneous and the largest populations in East Antarctica occur. In the summer of 2011/12, using GPS tracks, we calculated First Passage Time to extract Area Restricted Search (ARS) zones to indicate foraging intensity, and classified the ARS zones by K-means clustering. In total, 47, 64, 23 and 10 ARS zones were detected during early and late incubation, chick-guard and creche stages (n = 4, 11, 6 and 3 birds). Higher and more stable sea-ice concentration and increased distance from the nearest major colony had positive effects on foraging intensity. The ARS zones were classified into nearshore, offshore and open water habitats. Birds used offshore areas and avoided open water during early incubation and creche, when birds returned less frequently. During late incubation and chick-guard, when birds frequently returned, they used nearshore and open water areas as expected from the proportion of available habitats. Our results suggest that the pack ice and reduced intra-specific competition for prey were the preferred foraging condition for Adelie penguins, and highlight the importance of seasonal changes in sea-ice environment to their foraging habitat selectivity.																	0025-3162	1432-1793				JUL	2021	168	7							97	10.1007/s00227-021-03899-8							WOS:000663539200016

We quantitatively assess seasonal changes in community structure and habitat selection among seabirds in the Scotia-Weddell Confluence region, Antarctica. Additionally, we discuss the biological and physical factors underlying the patterns. Data were derived from strip-transects on closely-coordinated multidisciplinary cruises that characterized the physics and biology during spring 1983, autumn 1986 and winter 1988. 2. We describe for the first time ever for the Southern Ocean seasonal changes in seabird communities in terms of composition, using cluster analysis, as well as relative density and diversity among species. Sea-surface temperature, distance to the pack ice edge and ice type, all physical characteristics of habitat, were the most important environmental variables that affected assemblage composition. We identified three recurrent assemblages of species. One persistent assemblage, present year round, was associated with the pack ice; another was associated with open waters immediately adjacent to the ice; and a third was a far-from-ice assemblage. Only the two open-water assemblages changed markedly on a seasonal basis. 3. Close similarity of patterns in the spring 1983 data with those collected during spring 1976 in the Ross Sea, on the other side of Antarctica, supported our contention that we were comparing seasonal and not interannual differences in community structure. 4. In spite of a major reduction in the number and density of species in the open-water assemblages during winter, the pack-ice assemblage exhibited no habitat expansion, which might be expected if competition affected community structure and habitat selection. The pack ice, in contrast to the adjacent open water, is a habitat in which food is abundantly available year round for an assemblage of species specialized to exploit the opportunities present. Unspecialized species vacate the region when food becomes sparse.																	0021-8790	1365-2656				APR	1994	63	2					347	364		10.2307/5553							WOS:A1994MZ05700012

A Synergistic Approach for Evaluating Climate Model Output for Ecological Applications	FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE												Increasing concern about the impacts of climate change on ecosystems is prompting ecologists and ecosystem managers to seek reliable projections of physical drivers of change. The use of global climate models in ecology is growing, although drawing ecologically meaningful conclusions can be problematic. The expertise required to access and interpret output from climate and earth system models is hampering progress in utilizing them most effectively to determine the wider implications of climate change. To address this issue, we present a joint approach between climate scientists and ecologists that explores key challenges and opportunities for progress. As an exemplar, our focus is the Southern Ocean, notable for significant change with global implications, and on sea ice, given its crucial role in this dynamic ecosystem. We combined perspectives to evaluate the representation of sea ice in global climate models. With an emphasis on ecologically-relevant criteria (sea ice extent and seasonality) we selected a subset of eight models that reliably reproduce extant sea ice distributions. While the model subset shows a similar mean change to the full ensemble in sea ice extent (approximately 50% decline in winter and 30% decline in summer), there is a marked reduction in the range. This improved the precision of projected future sea ice distributions by approximately one third, and means they are more amenable to ecological interpretation.

Results of numerical simulation are presented for flow around a three-stranded rope in uniform flow. The simulation was carried out to study the hydrodynamic characteristics of pressure and velocity fields of steady incompressible laminar and turbulent wakes behind a three-stranded rope. A three-cylinder configuration and single circular cylinder configuration are used to model the three-stranded rope in the two-dimensional simulation. The governing equations, Navier-Stokes equations, are solved by using two-dimensional finite volume method. The turbulence flow is simulated using Standard kappa-epsilon model and Shear-Stress Transport kappa-omega (SST) model. The drag of the three-cylinder model and single cylinder model is calculated for different Reynolds numbers by using control volume analysis method. The pressure coefficient is also calculated for the turbulent model and laminar model based on the control surface method. From the comparison of the drag coefficient and the pressure of the single cylinder and three-cylinder models, it is found that the drag coefficients of the three-cylinder model are generally 1.3-1.5 times those of the single circular cylinder for different Reynolds numbers. Comparing the numerical results with water tank test data, the results of the three-cylinder model are closer to the experiment results than the single cylinder model results.																	1672-5182	1993-5021				AUG	2016	15	4					627	636		10.1007/s11802-016-2888-x							WOS:000379536300008

Developing integrated models of Southern Ocean food webs: Including ecological complexity, accounting for uncertainty and the importance of scale	PROGRESS IN OCEANOGRAPHY												The Southern Ocean supports diverse and unique ecosystems that have been impacted by more than two centuries of exploitation and are now experiencing rapid changes in ocean temperature and seasonal ice cover due to climate warming. Understanding and projecting responses of Southern Ocean marine ecosystems to changing climate conditions and direct human impacts, such as fisheries, requires integrated ecosystem analyses at scales previously unexplored. Here we consider the main ecological and modelling challenges in predicting the responses of Southern Ocean ecosystems to change, and propose three inter-linked focus areas that will advance the development of integrated models for Southern Ocean ecosystems. The first focus area is development of fundamental understanding of the factors that determine the structure and function of the food webs at multiple scales. Ecological research in the Southern Ocean is often centred on key species or localised systems, a tendency which is reflected in existing food web and ecosystem models. To build on this, a systematic analysis of regional food web structure and function is required. The second focus area is development of a range of mechanistic models that vary in their resolution of ecological processes, and consider links across physical scales, biogeochemical cycles and feedbacks, and the central role of zooplankton. These two focus areas underlie the third, which is development of methodologies for scenario testing across a range of trophic levels of the effects of past and future changes, which will facilitate consideration of the underlying complexity of interactions and the associated uncertainty. The complex nature of interactions determining Southern Ocean ecosystem structure and function will require new approaches, which we propose should be developed within a scale-based framework that emphasises both physical and ecological aspects.

Time series analysis of biologging data: autocorrelation reveals periodicity of diving behaviour in macaroni penguins	ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR												The nature of how behaviour at one time step influences the next is of great interest to behavioural ecologists, but rarely used for comparisons between animals. Time depth recorders (TDR) and other archival tags have been widely used to infer patterns of diving and foraging. However, while we can extract variables that describe individual dives, how runs of dives may indicate behaviours and how one dive influences the next are not fully understood. Treating TDR data as time series, we examined patterns of autocorrelation to investigate structure in the timing of behaviour. We fitted an oscillating best-fit curve to the autocorrelation and used the parameters of this curve to investigate differences in foraging strategy of 129 macaroni penguins, Eudyptes chrysolophus, of both sexes. We found interannual differences in autocorrelation parameters as well as differences between reproductive stages. In contrast to other studies of macaroni penguin diving based on depth analysis, we found no differences between the sexes. We mimicked changes in the various parameters by simulation of dive profiles, and used these to infer biological meaning from the parameters. As this technique makes very few assumptions about how to identify a dive or cluster of dives, we suggest that it is a useful first characterization of diving or cyclical behaviour in a wide range of animals.

Diel vertical migration of a Southern Ocean euphausiid, Euphausia triacantha, and its metabolic response to consequent short-term temperature changes	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												Diel vertical migration is a widespread behaviour amongst zooplankton, yet its effect on the rate at which individuals respire remains poorly understood. To address this, we investigated the effect of short-term temperature change on the respiration rate of Euphausia triacantha, a common component of the Southern Ocean zooplankton and a prominent vertical migrator. We found respiration to vary in response to size, with a value of 0.84 for the scaling coefficient, b. When scaled to b, respiration varied strongly in response to transitory temperature change, ranging from 0.37 to 1.65 mu l O-2 mg dry weight (DW)(-b) h(-1) between 0.17 and 4.74 degrees C, resulting in a Q(10) of 3.6. This Q(10) is higher than found by other studies examining the short-term respiration response of euphausiids, including those taking a multi-species perspective. This indicates that E. triacantha shows little compensation during short-term exposure to temperatures normally encountered during migration. Furthermore, it shows a distinct metabolic cost to diel vertical migration (DVM) when substantive changes in temperature are encountered over the course of the transit. This temporal variability in respiration rate has important implications for how community respiration is estimated, and for our understanding of DVM behaviour. Our results also have particular relevance to estimating the flux and sequestration of respiratory products, such as dissolved carbon dioxide, to and within the ocean interior.

J	Kirkwood, JM				Kirkwood, JM			The developmental rate of Euphausia crystallorophias larvae in Ellis Fjord, Vestfold Hills, Antarctica	POLAR BIOLOGY												Euphausia crystallorophias is the dominant zooplankton species in the neritic seas of Antarctica, where it occurs in similar abundances to those of Euphausia super bn in more offshore areas. Despite its great abundance and probable ecological significance, few details are known of this species' development, life history and ecology. This study found that E. crystallorophias spawned in Ellis Fjord from late November to early December and completed its larval development under the sea ice during the Antarctic winter. The mean time for E. crystallorophias eggs to develop to furcilia stage VI was 235.5 days, which is virtually identical to the developmental time already reported in the laboratory, but almost twice that of E. superba. This slow development rate is likely to be due either to the low water temperatures (< 0 degrees C) in which E. crystallorophias lives, or to low levels of food being available over winter.																	0722-4060					AUG	1996	16	7					527	530									WOS:A1996VC92500010

Particulates were sampled from four depths to 200 m in pack ice and at the ice edge, and from seven depths to 3000 min open ocean. Total n-alkane concentrations associated with particulates increased from 200 ng 1(-1) under the pack ice to 1000 ng 1(-1) in the open ocean, and decreased with depth in open water to 15 ng 1(-1) at 3000 m. The influence of phytoplankton on particulate material was shown to be negligible under the ice but extended horizontally and vertically as the ice edge retreated. Sea-ice algac did not appear to seed the phytoplankton growth under the ice or the subsequent ''bloom'' at the MIZ. The alkane signature of phytoplankton from the MIZ bloom was detected at a depth of 200 m near the ice edge, at 500 In in open sea; and in surface sediments (4100 m) Zooplankton biomarkers that were at low levels in krill under the ice were higher in animals from the open ocean but were not detected in the water column or sediments. It was concluded that the majority of particulate material in the water column was algal in origin. Material in the surface sediment from under pack ice probably originated from a deep-living winter population of copepods and material in surface sediment from the ice-free ocean originated from the algal ''bloom'' at the MIZ.																	0967-0645						1995	42	4-5					1123	1135		10.1016/0967-0645(95)00075-2							WOS:A1995RV69700013

Habitat selection by foraging macaroni penguins correlates with hematocrit, an index of aerobic condition	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												Reproductive investment during the chick-rearing period is an important contributor to lifetime fitness. Key to chick-rearing is the success of parental foraging, as food deliveries affect chick growth and survival up until fledging. For seabirds, oceanographic conditions including factors such as sea surface temperature are known to influence foraging decisions, but few studies have examined the physiological variables that might affect those decisions. We used global positioning systems (GPS), time-depth recorders (TDR), and physiological sampling techniques to explore links between ocean temperature, diving behavior, and foraging success in chick-rearing female macaroni penguins Eudyptes chrysolophus. We then explored correlations between these foraging variables and measures of individual physiological condition, specifically aerobic capacity (hematocrit) and metabolic state (corticosterone). In GPS-tracked penguins, 2 principal for aging tactics were observed: penguins made deep dives in cool, near-shore areas surrounding the breeding colony at Bird Island, South Georgia, or they traveled farther to dive shallower in warmer shelf-break areas. TDR-equipped penguins showed similar patterns. Blood sampling of TDR penguins at the onset of trips revealed strong positive correlations between hematocrit and the mean duration of foraging trips, the ocean temperature experienced during these trips, and the relative efficiency of foraging activity in terms of the number of foraging behaviors recorded per dive. These results suggest that aerobic capacity might be an important determinant of for aging trip range, as well as workload. Corticosterone was unrelated to diving behavior, which counters previous studies examining the effects of experimental increases of this hormone on foraging behavior, and we discuss reasons for this disparity.

There was considerable interannual variability in ice thickness with, average values of 62 cm in 2001 and 102 cm in 2002, with medians of 43 and 68 cm, respectively. Snow depth averaged 16 cm in 2001 and 21 cm in 2002. At 40% of the thickness holes in 2001 and 17% in 2002, a combination of deep snow and thin ice resulted in negative freeboard and the potential for surface flooding. Ice production was strongly influenced by the snow cover. Deep snow resulted in negative freeboard, surface flooding, and the formation of snow ice, but also limited columnar ice growth on the bottom of the ice. A stratigraphic analysis of ice thin sections showed that more than half of the ice sampled was granular and that virtually all of the upper 20 cm of the ice cover was granular. Stable isotope (6180) analysis of samples from 2001 indicated that snow-ice formation at the surface contributed significantly to ice formation. Two-thirds of the cores had some snow-ice and 15% of the ice sampled in 2001 was snow-ice. For 95% of the ice sampled the combination of warm ice temperatures and large salinities resulted in brine volumes that were greater than the percolation threshold of 5%. Autonomous mass balance buoys indicated that the ice was above the percolation threshold throughout late winter and spring. The exceeding of the percolation threshold allows continuous flooding to occur throughout the late winter-spring period. The WAP sea-ice therefore represents a warm "end-member" of the sea-ice covers of Antarctica. An expected consequence of the lengthy flooding condition at the snow/ice interface is an earlier onset of an algal bloom in the flooded snow than elsewhere in Antarctic sea ice.

The spring cruise took place in the offshore Ross Sea from 14 November to 14 December 1994. Sampling was carried out on a transect of 27 stations distributed from 76.5 to 72.0 degrees S along 175 degrees E, and covered the three main Antarctic environments of the polynya open waters, the marginal ice zone and the pack ice area. Three subsystems were identified. The subsystem of the polynya was characterised by the predominance of the micro- and nano-planktonic fractions, chlorophyll (Chl a) concentrations from 69.6 to 164.7 mg m(-2) and production rates from 0.68 to 1.14 g C m(-2) day(-1). The second subsystem, the marginal ice zone, showed a relative increase of the micro-planktonic fraction, high biomass levels (from 99.64 to 220 mg Chi m(-2)) and production rates from 0.99 to 2.7 g C m(-2) day(-1). The subsystem of the pack ice area had a phytoplankton community dominated by the pico-planktonic fraction and showed low biomasses (from 19.4 to 37.7 mg Chi m(-2)) and production rates (0.28 to 0.60 g C m-2 day(-1)). Selective grazing by krill is considered an important factor in determining the size structure of the phytoplankton communities. The summer study consisted of a time series carried out in inshore waters of Terra Nova Bay from 12 January to g February 1990. In a well stabilised water column and with high levels of PAR always available, the primary production rates of a community dominated by micro-plankton varied from 0.52 to 1.2 g C m(-2) day(-1) (average 0.84). A high P/B ratio, up to 3, and a remarkably elevated mean phaeopigment (Phaeo)/Chl a ratio of 2.4 indicated an active removal of biomass by grazing, confirmed by the presence of faecal pellets in quantities reaching 6000 m(-3) in the upper 50 m. The peculiarities of the inshore versus offshore environments in terms of community size structure, production processes and their implications as regards the food web are discussed.				d'Alcala', Maurizio Ribera/B-7114-2012; Russo, Aniello/A-2319-2010	d'Alcala', Maurizio Ribera/0000-0002-5492-9961; Russo, Aniello/0000-0003-3651-8146												0924-7963					NOV	1998	17	1-4					115	127		10.1016/S0924-7963(98)00033-5							WOS:000077463500009

Changes in positive associations among vertebrate predators at South Georgia during winter	POLAR BIOLOGY												We studied positive associations among seabirds and marine mammals at South Georgia on research cruises during the Austral winters of 1985, 1991 and 1993 and found statistically significant differences. We collected data on abundance and distribution, providing a critical reference for sub-Antarctic conservation in anticipation of future environmental changes. We found significant changes in the abundance of 29% of species surveyed and a consequent change in species diversity. We postulate that the resulting altered community composition may have previously unanticipated population effects on the component species, due to changes in positive interactions among species which use each other as cues to the presence of prey. We found a near threefold reduction in spatial overlap among vertebrate predators, associated with warming sea temperatures. As the strength and opportunity for positive associations decreases in the future, feeding success may be negatively impacted. In this way, environmental changes may disproportionately impact predator abundances and such changes are likely already underway, as Southern Ocean temperatures have increased substantially since our surveys. Of course the changes we describe are not solely due to changing sea temperature or any other single cause-many factors are important and we do not claim to have removed these from consideration. Rather, we report previously undocumented changes in positive associations among species, and argue these changes may continue into the future, given near-certain continued increases in climate-related changes.																	0722-4060	1432-2056				OCT	2020	43	10					1439	1451		10.1007/s00300-020-02720-4		JUL 2020					WOS:000551753600002

Salps in the Lazarev Sea, Southern Ocean: II. Biochemical composition and potential prey value	MARINE BIOLOGY												Two species of salps, Salpa thompsoni and Ihlea racovitzai, were sampled during three cruises to the Lazarev Sea, Southern Ocean, in summer (December-January) 2005/2006, Autumn (April-May) 2004 and Winter (July-August) 2006. Dry weight, carbon, nitrogen, protein, lipid and carbohydrate contents were measured to characterize the potential value of salps as a food source for predators in the Antarctic ecosystem. Biochemical composition measurements showed that despite having a high percentage of water (similar to 94% of wet weight), both species had relatively high carbon and protein contents in their remaining dry weight (DW). In particular I. racovitzai showed high carbon (up to 22% of DW) and protein (up to 32% of DW) values during all seasons sampled, compared to lower values for S. thompsoni (carbon content only about 15% of the DW, protein content about 10% of the DW). At the same time, carbohydrates (CH) and lipids (Lip) only accounted for a small portion of salp DW in both species (1.4% CH and 3.6% Lip for I. racovitzai; 2.1% CH and 2.9% Lip for S. thompsoni). There was little variability in the biochemical composition of either salp species between the seasons sampled. Both biochemical composition and life cycle characteristics suggest that Antarctic salps, especially I. racovitzai, may be important prey items for both cold and warm-blooded predators in an environment where food is often very scarce.																	0025-3162					JAN	2012	159	1					15	24		10.1007/s00227-011-1785-5							WOS:000299198900002

Bottom-moored free-vehicle acoustic instruments were used in concert with midwater trawls and baited traps to examine the abundance, size distribution and vertical distribution of pelagic organisms in the uppermost 100 m of the water column during the austral spring of 1992 in two areas of the northwestern Weddell Sea, one covered by seasonal pack ice and the other free of ice cover. Acoustic targets were more abundant and significantly larger at the open-water station than beneath pack ice. However, targets at the ice-covered site exhibited a pronounced diel pattern, with the largest targets detected only at night. Samples from night trawls at the ice-covered site contained several species of large, vertically-migrating mesopelagic fishes, whereas these species were absent from trawls taken during the day. In addition, baited traps deployed in pack ice just beneath the ice-water interface collected large numbers of scavenging lysianassoid amphipods, while deeper traps beneath the ice and traps at the open-water station were empty, indicating the presence of a scavenging community associated with the undersurface of the ice. These results support the idea that mesopelagic organisms migrate closer to the surface beneath pack ice than in open water, exposing them to possible predation by surface-foraging seabirds.																	0025-3162					DEC	1995	124	3					387	397		10.1007/BF00363912							WOS:A1995TM47100005

The method involves sequentially destabilising an eigenvalue at the boundary equilibrium point of the winning population at each trophic level. We illustrate the procedure on a six population, three trophic level ecosystem model of a pelagic Antarctic ecosystem. We used the method to find an initial parameter set for which all populations coexisted. Only three model evaluations were required to find a parameter set that allowed coexistence. In contrast, a random search of parameter space required an average of 250 model evaluations to find each coexistence parameter set. The method is useful for identifying regions of parameter space that have high densities of coexistence solutions. Crown Copyright (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

J	Schnack-Schiel, SB; Isla, E				Schnack-Schiel, SB; Isla, E			The role of zooplankton in the pelagic-benthic coupling of the Southern Ocean	SCIENTIA MARINA					IBMANT/ANDEEP International Symposium and Workshop	2003	Ushuaia, ARGENTINA	IBMANT, ANDEEP				Zooplankton contributes in different ways to pelagic-benthic coupling: Their faecal material is a major route of energy flow and the vertical migrations of many species as well as the production of pelagic larvae by benthic organisms represent different paths to link the two subsystems. Antarctic particle fluxes have been shown to be highly variable in size and composition within a given region and even at the same site from year to year. There are also differences throughout the water column, where particle fluxes close to the sea floor beyond the continental shelf break do not normally show seasonal variation within shallow environments. Commonly, at depths shallower than 500 m, the most evident feature is that more than 90% of the annual fluxes occur during a short period of the spring-summer. This event is masked near the seabed at greater depths due to resupension and lateral advection of particles. Faecal material of various origins is one of the main constituents of the biogenic matter flux. It usually reaches its maximum in February once the early phytoplankton bloom has developed. However, the presence of faecal pellets is ubiquitous during the months of the year when there is enough light to support primary production. At this stage more research is needed to elucidate the particular role of distinct taxa-including among others salps, krill, copepods and protozoans-in the transport of organic matter to the benthos, and their contribution to the biogeochemical cycles of carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus and silicon. Aggregation of particles is another important process controlling the development and dynamics of pelagic-benthic coupling due to its influence on the sinking velocity of particles and the enhancement of organic matter utilisation by members of the microbial loop in the upper layers of the water column. Also in shallow waters, aggregation favours the transfer of high-quality organic matter to the benthic realm. At greater depths resuspended aggregates and single particles from shallow environments may constitute a considerable fraction of the "fresh" biogenic flux. Submarine canyons accelerate and cause more efficient transfer of energy to the deep-sea benthos. Both faecal pellets and aggregation increase the original sinking velocity of individual particles and reduce their residence time in the water column, thus creating rich organic mats over the seabed in shallow environments. In the Southern Ocean these rapid organic matter transfers are important since they allow the accumulation of highly nutritive material, which may fuel the benthos during the dark months due to constant resuspension by tidal currents. Several factors control the particle fluxes in the Southern Ocean, such as size and composition of phytoplankton blooms, currents, seasonality, depth, and ice coverage. Due to this complexity, despite many efforts there is still a long way to go before the pathway of this ecologically important link can be fully understood and described. Our knowledge of the pelagic-benthic coupling in the Magellan region is still extremely limited and offers many opportunities for future scientific research. The same holds true for the production of meroplanktonic larvae in the Southern Ocean.																	0214-8358	1886-8134				DEC	2005	69			2			39	55		10.3989/scimar.2005.69s239							WOS:000234678700005						
J	Mangano, MC; Sara, G; Corsolini, S				Mangano, Maria Cristina; Sara, Gianluca; Corsolini, Simonetta			Monitoring of persistent organic pollutants in the polar regions: knowledge gaps & gluts through evidence mapping	CHEMOSPHERE												Persistent organic pollutants (POPs) are widespread compounds that accumulating in polar regions canalise through trophic webs. Although several dozens of studies have been carried out in the last decades, the information is generally scattered across a large number of literature sources. This does not allow an efficient synthesis and constraints our understanding on how address future monitoring plans and environmental conservation strategies on the Polar Regions with respect to POPs. Thus, here, we present the outcome of a systematic map (SM) to scope, screen and chart evidences from literature dealing with POPs in Polar regions. The SMs strive to produce rigorous guidelines and have recently been proposed as useful and effective tools to summarise growing bodies of research that seek to reduce bias and increase reliability, particularly in the case of high priority and controversial topics. Our SM was based on 125 polar studies, focussing on the most studied target species among those listed in the International Union for Conservation of Nature's Red List (IUCN Red List). To facilitate analysis of evidence, the studies were classified into Accumulation Monitoring (accounting for POP monitoring through sub-organismal, functional and population levels) and Food Web Monitoring approaches (accounting for contaminants monitoring through food webs). Our SM allowed us to assess and visualise, a set of both knowledge gaps and gluts and lastly a list was provided to address future research on POPs in Polar Regions. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Salps appeared on the beach 2 days after very strong ( > 80 km.h(-1)) winds were registered, which accumulated particulate material in the inner part of the cove and probably also re-suspended bottom sediments. The sharp increase in particulate-matter concentrations in Potter Cove caused clogging of salp mucous filtering nets, and probably a combination of clogging, winds and tides caused dying salps to be washed out onto the beach.

Using Forecasting Methods to Incorporate Social, Economic, and Political Considerations Into Marine Protected Area Planning	FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE												As the global environmental crisis grows in scale and complexity, conservation professionals and policymakers are increasingly called upon to make decisions despite high levels of uncertainty, limited resources, and insufficient data. Global efforts to protect biodiversity in areas beyond national jurisdiction require substantial international cooperation and negotiation, both of which are characterized by unpredictability and high levels of uncertainty. Here we build on recent studies to adapt forecasting techniques from the fields of hazard prediction, risk assessment, and intelligence analysis to forecast the likelihood of marine protected area (MPA) designation in the Southern Ocean. We used two questionnaires, feedback, and a discussion round in a Delphi-style format expert elicitation to obtain forecasts, and collected data on specific biophysical, socioeconomic, geopolitical, and scientific factors to assess how they shape and influence these forecasts. We found that areas further north along the Western Antarctic Peninsula were considered to be less likely to be designated than areas further south, and that geopolitical factors, such as global politics or events, and socioeconomic factors, such as the presence of fisheries, were the key determinants of whether an area was predicted to be more or less likely to be designated as an MPA. Forecasting techniques can be used to inform protected area design, negotiation, and implementation in highly politicized situations where data is lacking by aiding with spatial prioritization, targeting scarce resources, and predicting the success of various spatial arrangements, interventions, or courses of action.																		2296-7745				AUG 13	2021	8								669135	10.3389/fmars.2021.669135							WOS:000692552400001

Distribution of euphausiid larvae along the coast of East Antarctica in the Dumont d'Urville Sea (139-145 degrees E) during summer 2004	ANTARCTIC SCIENCE												The distribution of euphausiid larvae along the coast of Terre Adelie, Antarctica, was assessed using oblique tows of a double-framed bongo net at 38 stations during summer 2004. Larvae of Euphausia crystallorophias and Thysanoessa macrura were observed. For E. crystallorophias larvae, the calyptopis I stage was dominant along the coast, while the most commonly observed stage of T macrura was the furcilia. The distribution of E. crystallorophias larvae were correlated with abiotic factors, including depth and sea surface salinity, whereas those of T macrura larvae were correlated with biotic factors, especially chlorophyll a and nitrate. Developmental stages of both species increased in age from west to east in the survey area, with younger developmental stages (metanauplius and calyptopis I) in the western part of the region and older stages (calyptopis II and III and furcilia I to VI) in the eastern part near the Mertz Glacier Tongue (MGT). It is suggested that these patterns could be linked with the water circulation and wind: near the MGT gyres could concentrate all developmental stages of both species near the coast, while katabatic winds near Dumont d'Urville will promote larval advection seawards, with younger stages near the coast and older stages further offshore.

J	Piepenburg, D; Schmid, MK; Gerdes, D				Piepenburg, D; Schmid, MK; Gerdes, D			The benthos off King George Island (South Shetland Islands, Antarctica): further evidence for a lack of a latitudinal biomass cline in the Southern Ocean	POLAR BIOLOGY												The benthic fauna off King George Island (South Shetland Islands, Antarctica) was investigated during "Polarstern" expedition ANT XV/3 in March 1998. Samples were taken along two cross-shelf/slope transects both north (Drake Passage) and south of the island (Bransfield Strait, off Potter Cove) at water depths ranging from 130 m to 2,000 m. For a quantitative inventory, a multibox corer was used at nine stations to collect mostly infaunal macrobenthos, at seven stations, seabed photography was employed concomitantly to survey the epibenthic megafauna. Macrofauna abundances ranged from 730 ind. m(-2) at 2.000 m to > 14,000 ind. m(-2) at 100 m; biomass values varied between about 50 g wet mass m(-2) (16 g ash-free dry mass m(-2)) at 2,000 m and about 950 g wet mass m(-2) (about 90 g ash-free dry mass m(-2)) at 200 m. Densities were dominated everywhere by polychaetes. followed by bivalves, crustaceans and ophiuroids: in terms of biomass, krill and holothurians surpassed polychaetes at some stations. No significant differences between the northern and the southern transects in total abundance and biomass were obvious. Megafauna abundances were clearly higher south of King George Island, totalling about 110-150 ind. m(-2) on the shelf (235-330 m) and about 50 ind. m(-2) at the continental slope (750 m), whereas along the northern transect they reached values of only 21-31 ind. m(-2) on the shelf (130-430 m) and decreased at the continental slope m) to about 5 ind. m(-2). A brittle star, Ophionotus victoriae, strongly dominated the southern-shelf epibenthos, with relative abundances of 70-95% and a biomass of about 40-80 g wet mass m(-2) (about 4-7 g ash-free dry mass m(-2)), but was numerically less important at the slope (5%) where ammotheid pycnogonids prevailed (80%). Macro- and megabenthos distribution patterns were characterized by a pronounced shelf-slope gradient - in standing stock as well as in faunistic composition - but this resemblance was statistically not significant. This finding indicates that the spatial distributions of macrobenthos and megabenthos are primarily determined by a depth-dependent factor, most probably food supply, but apparently respond differently to secondary driving forces, possibly seabed features. Our results provide further evidence for the notion that there is no distinct latitudinal gradient in benthic abundance and biomass in the Southern Ocean between the South American Magellan region and high-Antarctic waters of the Weddell Sea.

Elephant seals (Mirounga leonine) from the Kerguelen Islands (49 degrees 20'S, 70 degrees 20'E) have several different foraging strategies. Why some individuals undertake long trips to the Antarctic continent while others utilize the relatively close frontal zones is poorly understood. Here, we investigate how physical properties within the sea ice zone are linked to foraging activities of southern elephant seals (SES). To do this, we first developed a new approach using indices of foraging derived from high temporal resolution dive and accelerometry data to predict foraging behaviour in an extensive, low resolution dataset from CTD-Satellite Relay Data Loggers (CTD-SRDLs). A sample of 37 post-breeding SES females were used to construct a predictive model applied to demersal and pelagic dive strategies relating prey encounter events (PEE) to dive parameters (dive duration, bottom duration, hunting-time, maximum depth, ascent speed, descent speed, sinuosity, and horizontal speed) for each strategy. We applied these models to a second sample of 35 seals, 20 males and 15 females, during the post-moult foraging trip to the Antarctic continental shelf between 2004 and 2013, which did not have fine-scale behavioural data. The females were widely distributed with important foraging activity south of the Southern Boundary Front, while males predominately travelled to the south-eastern part of the East Antarctica region. Combining our predictions of PEE with environmental features (sea ice concentration, water masses at the bottom phase of dives, bathymetry and slope index) we found higher foraging activity for females over shallower seabed depths and at the boundary between the overlying Antarctic Surface Water (AASW) and the underlying Modified Circumpolar Deep Water (MCDW). Increased biological activity associated with the upper boundary of MCDW, may provide overwintering areas for SES prey. Male foraging activity was strongly associated with pelagic dives within the Antarctic Slope Front where upwelling of nutrient rich Circumpolar Deep Water onto surface water may enhance and concentrate resources. A positive association between sea ice and foraging activity was found for both sexes where increased biological activity may sustain an under-ice ecosystem. Variability of the East Antarctic sea ice season duration is likely a crucial element to allow air-breathing predators to benefit from profitable prey patches within the pack ice habitat.

J	Becker, PH; Goutner, V; Ryan, PG; Gonzalez-Solis, J				Becker, Peter H.; Goutner, Vassilis; Ryan, Peter G.; Gonzalez-Solis, Jacob			Feather mercury concentrations in Southern Ocean seabirds: Variation by species, site and time	ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION												We studied mercury contamination in 25 seabird species breeding along a latitudinal gradient across the Southern Ocean, from Gough Island (40 degrees S) through Marion Island (47 degrees S) to Byers Peninsula (63 degrees S). Total mercury concentrations in body feather samples of adults caught at breeding colonies from 2008 to 2011 were determined. Krill (Euphausia spp.) and other zooplankton consumers had low mercury concentrations (gentoo penguin Pygoscelis papua, chinstrap penguin Pseudomonas Antarctica, common diving petrel Pelecanoides urinatrix, broad-billed prion Pachyptila vittata; mean levels 308-753 ng g(-1)), whereas seabirds consuming squid or carrion had high mercury concentrations (ascending order: Kerguelen petrel Aphrodroma brevirostris, southern giant petrel Macronectes giganteus, soft-plumaged petrel Pterodroma mollis, sooty albatross Phoebetria fusca, Atlantic petrel Pterodroma incerta, northern giant petrel Macronectes halli, great-winged petrel Pterodroma macroptera; 10,720-28038 ng g(-1)). The two species with the highest mercury concentrations, northern giant petrels and great-winged petrels, bred at Marion Island. Among species investigated at multiple sites, southern giant petrels had higher mercury levels at Marion than at Gough Island and Byers Peninsula. Mercury levels among Byers Peninsula seabirds were low, in two species even lower than levels measured 10 years before at Bird Island, South Georgia. Replicate measurements after about 25 years at Gough Island showed much higher mercury levels in feathers of sooty albatrosses (by 187%), soft-plumaged petrels (53%) and Atlantic petrels (49%). Concentrations similar to the past were detected in southern giant petrels at Gough and Marion islands, and in northern giant petrels at Marion. There were no clear indications that timing of moult or migratory behavior affected mercury contamination patterns among species. Causes of inter-site or temporal differences in mercury contamination could not be verified due to a lack of long-term data related to species' diet and trophic levels, which should be collected in future together with data on mercury contamination.

Environmental drivers of humpback whale foraging behavior in the remote Southern Ocean	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY												Satellite telemetry and animal movement models advance our ability to remotely monitor the behavior of wideranging species. Understanding how different behaviors (e.g. foraging) are shaped by dynamic environmental features is fundamental to understanding ecological interactions and the impact of variability. In this study we deployed satellite-linked tags on humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) and used state-space models to estimate locations and to infer underlying behavioral states. We then modelled the association between whale behavior (e.g. foraging or transiting) and environmental variables using linear mixed-effect models, We identified the importance of two recently discovered Southern Ocean feeding areas for Oceania humpback whales as well as the key environmental drivers affecting whale behavior. We detected behavioral differences between whales utilizing the two adjacent feeding regions (similar to 2000 km apart), which were likely caused by animals trying to efficiently locate prey in relation to the dynamic environmental characteristics of each habitat. We observed a seasonal pattern in foraging behavior, with the peak occurring in the middle of summer. Whales also foraged more intensively with increasing proximity to areas from which the ice edge had recently retreated, suggesting heightened productivity in these areas. The relationship between the animals and the physical features of the seascape, as well as the behavioral plasticity observed, could have implications for the future recovery of these whales in a changing Southern Ocean.

Minimising the limitations of using dietary analysis to assess foodweb changes by combining multiple techniques	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												Dietary studies of marine predators offer an immediate signal of foodweb changes occurring at lower trophic levels, and therefore are often used to assess the ecosystem status of marine systems. Conventionally, these studies are based on morphological analysis of prey remains in stomach contents, involving invasive and destructive techniques to collect samples. More recently, the number of dietary studies based on less invasive biochemical and molecular approaches has dramatically increased. However, all three methods, morphological, biochemical and molecular, have well-documented limitations for resolving taxonomy, temporal variation or biomass composition. In this study, we minimise these limitations by considering multiple techniques in combination. As a case study, we report the target prey species and diet composition of a marine predator that has been used to assess annual change in managed fishing areas for several decades, the macaroni penguin Eudyptes ehrysolophus. We use biochemical (stable isotope) and molecular (DNA) analysis of faecal samples collected across the different phases of a single breeding season, and compare the resolved diet to a 26-year dataset of stomach contents collected from a closely located colony (0.25 km apart) that exploits identical foraging grounds. Molecular analysis increased the known target prey species for this highly monitored population by 31%, including a fish species of commercial importance. Biochemical analysis detected subtle changes in the proportion of fish and krill in the diet, demonstrating promising opportunities for using a combined molecular and biochemical method to assess inter-annual foodweb changes at lower trophic levels. The combined approach offers a less invasive sampling methodology, compared to morphological analysis, and provides more information regarding prey species diversity and the overall trophic signature of the diet. Further studies are required to examine the feasibility of using this approach for long-term dietary studies of different marine predator species.

The lack of any nutritional information required for feed development in this species initiated this study to understand the effect of different dietary lipid sources on tissue lipid profiles and expression of selected lipid metabolising genes. Krill oil, marine oil (blend of fish oils), and vegetable oil (combination of linseed and palm oil), were utilised to formulate three experimental feeds with different phospholipid, triacylglycerol and polyunsaturated fatty acid profiles. Experimental feeds were administered to freshly moulted juvenile S. verreauxi for 50 to 55 days, to determine the effect of lipid sources on the nutritional status, fatty acid composition and expression of genes related to fatty acid biosynthesis, beta-oxidation, lipid catabolism and regulation of lipid metabolism. While there were no significant differences in terms of weight gain and mortality among different dietary treatments, the fatty acids composition in the hepatopancreas and to some extent, muscle tissues correlated with the fatty acids composition of the respective dietary treatments. Vegetable oil diet resulted in higher expression of genes related to beta-oxidation, which indicates selectivity towards utilisation of monounsaturated fatty acids for energy in this species. In tandem, genes related to fatty acid and cholesterol biosynthesis were upregulated, suggesting their importance in the marine lobster diet. This is the first report on the use of formulated feeds to successfully maintain juvenile S. verreauxi.

J	Antezana, T				Antezana, T			Plankton of Southern Chilean fjords: trends and linkages	SCIENTIA MARINA												The present paper compiles and reviews past and recent results from Magellan and Fuegian fjords for an overview of the planktonic assemblage there. It first examines linkages to local, adjacent and remote environments. The plankton assemblage presents deviations from the biota of the Magellan biogeographic Province, where the occasional presence of Antarctic species is related to oceanographic phenomena at the Polar Front. Complex bathymetric and hydrographic features within the fjords suggest that the plankton is rather isolated. Adaptations and constraints for population survival, and the role of diel migrators and gregarious zooplankters with regard to bentho-pelagic coupling are discussed. Results on seasonal differences in the plankton of the largest and most isolated basin of the Strait of Magellan are compiled. In spring the plankton was dominated by large diatoms suggesting a short food chain where most of the phytoplankton bloom goes to the bottom, to the meroplankton and to a few dominant holoplankters. In summer, the phytoplankton was dominated by pico- and nanophytoplankton suggesting a more complex food web mediated by a bacterial loop. High abundance of holo- and meroplanktonic larvae coincided with spring blooming conditions.																	0214-8358					DEC	1999	63			1			69	80		10.3989/scimar.1999.63s169							WOS:000085828800009

Distribution and community structure of euphausiids in the Southern Ocean along the 140 degrees E meridian during the austral summer 2001/2002	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY												The abundance, biomass, diversity and community structure of euphausiids in the Southern Ocean along the 140 degrees E meridian from latitudes 47 degrees S-65 degrees S were examined by RMT8 from 0 to ca. 1000 m during the 2001/2002 austral summer. Both total abundance and biomass of euphausiids were much higher in the south of the southern branch of the Polar Front (PF-S) located at 60 degrees S-61 degrees S than in the northern part, corresponding with higher chlorophyll a concentrations. Eleven species of euphausiids were collected from the research areas: 2 species of Thysanoessa, 6 of Euphausia, and a single species each of Thysanopoda, Bentheuphausia and Nematoselis. In Euphausia and Thysanoessa, clear horizontal distribution patterns enabled the classification of each species into one of 3 different types: species occurring only at stations north of the PF, species occurring in a broad distribution from south of the PF-S to the south of the Southern Boundary (SB) of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current, and species occurring only south of the SB. The latitudinal zonations occurrence and peak abundance were evident for all species. Hierarchical cluster analysis by species and station resulted in the identification of 2 distinct communities of euphausiids: community I comprised the three stations north of the PF where both euphausiid abundance and biomass were relatively low, and 2 species, Thysanopoda acutifrons and Thysanoessa gregaria dominated, community II comprised the southern five stations where abundance and biomass were high and Euphausia frigida, E. superba and Thysanoessa macrura were numerically dominant. Among the five oceanographic fronts within the research area, the PF (either south or north) appears to be the important biogeographical boundary separating abundance, biomass, and the community structure of euphausiids.

Because ice forms on the sea surface at night, parents foraged through cracks or within leads in the sea ice mainly during 0800-2400 hours. Birds that departed the colony in the afternoon and returned in the evening of the same day fed their chicks more frequently than those that made longer trips (i.e., those that departed in the afternoon and returned the next day or departed in the early morning and returned that evening). When the duration of the longest dive bout during each trip was longer, parents brought back heavier meals that contained larger krill. On average, birds made longer dive bouts when diving to greater depths. Thus, daily foraging pattern and foraging depth affected the provisioning rate, but the proportion of time spent foraging during the potential foraging period, total underwater time per day, and parental body condition were not. We suggest that temporal variability in prey availability and individual differences in foraging behavior affect the provisioning rate and, thus, chick growth.

In stark contrast to widespread declines along the Scotia Arc, a survey of the South Sandwich Islands finds a robust seabird community	POLAR BIOLOGY												The South Sandwich Islands, in the South Atlantic Ocean, are a major biological hot spot for penguins and other seabirds, but their remoteness and challenging coastlines preclude regular biological censuses. Here we report on an extensive survey of the South Sandwich Islands, the first since the late 1990s, which was completed through a combination of direct counting, GPS mapping, and interpretation of high-resolution commercial satellite imagery. We find that the South Sandwich Islands host nearly half of the world's Chinstrap Penguin (Pygoscelis antarctica) population (1.3 million breeding pairs), as well as c. 95,000 breeding pairs of Macaroni Penguins (Eudyptes chrysolophus), and several thousand breeding pairs of Gentoo Penguins (Pygoscelis papua). Despite being at the northern edge of their breeding range, we found an unexpectedly large (>= 125,000 breeding pairs) population of Adelie Penguins (Pygoscelis adeliae). Additionally, we report that nearly 1900 pairs of Southern Giant Petrels (Macronectes giganteus) breed in the South Sandwich Islands, 4 % of the global population, almost all of which are found on Candlemas Island. We find that the South Sandwich Islands have not experienced the same changes in penguin abundance and distribution as the rest of the Scotia Arc and associated portions of the western Antarctic Peninsula. This discovery adds important context to the larger conversation regarding changes to penguin populations in the Southern Ocean.																	0722-4060	1432-2056				SEP	2016	39	9					1615	1625		10.1007/s00300-015-1886-6							WOS:000384551500010

Integrating Stomach Content and Stable Isotope Analyses to Quantify the Diets of Pygoscelid Penguins	PLOS ONE												Stomach content analysis (SCA) and more recently stable isotope analysis (SIA) integrated with isotopic mixing models have become common methods for dietary studies and provide insight into the foraging ecology of seabirds. However, both methods have drawbacks and biases that may result in difficulties in quantifying inter-annual and species-specific differences in diets. We used these two methods to simultaneously quantify the chick-rearing diet of Chinstrap (Pygoscelis antarctica) and Gentoo (P. papua) penguins and highlight methods of integrating SCA data to increase accuracy of diet composition estimates using SIA. SCA biomass estimates were highly variable and underestimated the importance of soft-bodied prey such as fish. Two-source, isotopic mixing model predictions were less variable and identified inter-annual and species-specific differences in the relative amounts of fish and krill in penguin diets not readily apparent using SCA. In contrast, multi-source isotopic mixing models had difficulty estimating the dietary contribution of fish species occupying similar trophic levels without refinement using SCA-derived otolith data. Overall, our ability to track inter-annual and species-specific differences in penguin diets using SIA was enhanced by integrating SCA data to isotopic mixing modes in three ways: 1) selecting appropriate prey sources, 2) weighting combinations of isotopically similar prey in two-source mixing models and 3) refining predicted contributions of isotopically similar prey in multi-source models.

We used stratified, quantitative sampling from the surface to 2,000 m depth with an RMT 8 net in January of 2005 and 2006 to determine the distribution and population structure of salps in the north of Lutzow-Holm Bay, East Antarctica. Ihlea racovitzai occurred in both 2005 and 2006, but S. thompsoni was found only in 2005. Ihlea racovitzai occurred abundantly along the ice edge where Antarctic Winter Water was well developed, whereas S. thompsoni was more abundant at northern stations affected by warm Modified Circumpolar Deep Water. Small solitary stages of I. racovitzai dominated in 2005, but they had declined significantly by 2006. The S. thompsoni population was composed of small immature aggregates and mature solitary stages, suggesting that the solitary stages were reproducing. We did not find mature aggregate and immature solitary stages in the present study and thus suggested that S. thompsoni was unable to complete its life cycle in the north of Lutzow-Holm Bay because of failure of sexual reproduction in the aggregate stage. The S. thompsoni population was therefore probably transported to our study area by advection.																	0722-4060	1432-2056				JUN	2013	36	6					807	817		10.1007/s00300-013-1305-9							WOS:000318722600005

To evaluate differences in the foraging habitat of these two species, we recorded their foraging locations and diving behavior using recently developed GPS-depth data loggers. The study was conducted on King George Island, Antarctica during the chick-guarding period of both species, from December 2006 to January 2007. The area used for foraging, estimated as the 95% kernel density of dive (> 5 m) locations, overlapped partially between the two species (26.4 and 68.5% of the area overlapped for chinstrap and gentoo penguins, respectively). However, the core foraging area, estimated as the 50% kernel density, was mostly separate (12.8 and 25.0% of the area overlapped for chinstrap and gentoo penguins, respectively). Chinstrap penguins tended to use off-shelf (water depth > 200 m) regions (77% of the locations for dives > 5 m), whereas gentoo penguins mainly used on-shelf (water depth < 200 m) areas (71% of dive locations). The data on foraging locations, diving behavior, and bathymetry indicated that gentoo penguins often performed benthic dives (28% of dives > 5 m), whereas chinstrap penguins almost always used the epipelagic/mid-water layer (96% of dives > 5 m). Diving parameters such as diving bottom duration or diving efficiency differed between the species, reflecting differences in the use of foraging habitat. The diving parameters also suggested that the on-shelf benthic layer was profitable foraging habitat for gentoo penguins. Conversely, the relationship between trip duration, date, and stomach content mass suggested that the chinstrap penguins went further from the colony to forage as the season progressed, possibly reflecting a reduction in prey availability near the colony. Our results suggest that chinstrap and gentoo penguins segregated their foraging habitat in the Antarctic coastal marine environment, possibly due to inter- and intra-specific competition for common prey resources.																	0025-3162	1432-1793				APR	2010	157	4					811	825		10.1007/s00227-009-1364-1							WOS:000275658000012

Despite low and constant water temperatures, large variations in the delta-C-13 values of plankton were measured. C-13 enrichments of up to 10 parts per thousand coincided with a change in the diatom assemblage and a two-fold increase in primary production. Increased CO2 consumption as a result of rapid carbon fixation may result in diffusion limitation reducing the magnitude of the isotope fractionation. The delta-C-13 values of plankton from sea-ice cores display a relationship with the chlorophyll a content. High 'ice-algae' biomass, in combination with a limited exchange with the surrounding seawater, results in values of about -18 to -20 parts per thousand. It is assumed that these values are related to a reduced CO2 availability in the sea-ice system. In comparison with plankton, sinking krill faeces sampled by traps can be enriched by 2-5 parts per thousand in C-13 (e.g. central Bransfield Strait ). In contrast, the transport of particles in other faeces, diatom aggregates or chains results in minor isotope changes (e.g. Drake Passage, Powell Basin, NW Weddell Sea). A comparison between the delta-C-13 values of sinking matter and those of surface sediments reveals that C-13 enrichments of up to 3-4 parts per thousand may occur at the sediment-water boundary layer. These isotopic changes are attributed to high benthic respiration rates,																	0304-4203					NOV	1991	35	1-4					581	596		10.1016/S0304-4203(09)90044-5							WOS:A1991GZ58500042

We present a population projection for the emperor penguin population of Terre Adelie, Antarctica, by linking demographic models (stage-structured, seasonal, nonlinear, two-sex matrix population models) to sea ice forecasts from an ensemble of IPCC climate models. Based on maximum likelihood capture-mark-recapture analysis, we find that seasonal sea ice concentration anomalies (SICa) affect adult survival and breeding success. Demographic models show that both deterministic and stochastic population growth rates are maximized at intermediate values of annual SICa, because neither the complete absence of sea ice, nor heavy and persistent sea ice, would provide satisfactory conditions for the emperor penguin. We show that under some conditions the stochastic growth rate is positively affected by the variance in SICa. We identify an ensemble of five general circulation climate models whose output closely matches the historical record of sea ice concentration in Terre Adelie. The output of this ensemble is used to produce stochastic forecasts of SICa, which in turn drive the population model. Uncertainty is included by incorporating multiple climate models and by a parametric bootstrap procedure that includes parameter uncertainty due to both model selection and estimation error. The median of these simulations predicts a decline of the Terre Adelie emperor penguin population of 81% by the year 2100. We find a 43% chance of an even greater decline, of 90% or more. The uncertainty in population projections reflects large differences among climate models in their forecasts of future sea ice conditions. One such model predicts population increases over much of the century, but overall, the ensemble of models predicts that population declines are far more likely than population increases. We conclude that climate change is a significant risk for the emperor penguin. Our analytical approach, in which demographic models are linked to IPCC climate models, is powerful and generally applicable to other species and systems.

Using empirical orthogonal function analysis and k-means classification, we classified the study area into eight regions, which were in good accordance with the oceanographic and topographic features Examination of the chlorophyll-a time series in each region revealed that contrary to our expectation, regular seasonal phytoplankton blooms were observed only in a limited area. Of the eight regions, only two showed typical seasonal blooms, and one showed weak seasonality, whereas other regions exhibited irregular seasonal blooms of variable duration We attribute the absence of regularity in seasonal blooms to relatively shallow winter mixing, which would prevent entrainment of limiting micronutrients such as iron and silicate In the southwest Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean, topographic effects and sea ice may be the most important factors controlling primary productivity In the South Georgia region, chlorophyll-a showed a significant correlation with geostrophic current velocity, indicating that topographic effects depend on the interaction of current strength and topographic structure. Interannual variability of the surface chlorophyll in some regions also revealed longer periodicity (similar to 6 years) The periodicity seemed to be related to El Nino-Southern Oscillation and to sea-ice dynamics influenced by the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved.

In this study. we used these combined methods to determine the relationships between stable isotopic signatures in Black-tailed Gulls Torus crassirostris primary feathers and the areas in which the feathers are presumed to have been grown. The fifth primary (P5) feathers are replaced during late August, and although the migratory movements for seven of the eight gulls studied during this replacement period differed, the isotopic (delta N-15 and delta C-13 values were similar. These values indicated that the seven gulls fed on a wide range of prey from krill to demersal fish species. The isotopic values from P5 for the individual gull that moved southward after breeding, were much higher than for the seven other birds. In contrast, all eight gulls showed a relatively narrow distribution during the replacement of their outermost primaries (P10), which were replaced during mid October and November. However, the isotopic values from P10 of the individual that moved southward during replacement of P5 were also much higher. The unique isotopic values of this gull might indicate specialization in anthropogenic food resources or high trophic level resources through the migration period, regardless of location. Contrary to previous studies, our research did not detect links between migratory movements and stable isotopic signatures from feathers in Torus gulls migrating through a relatively narrow range and having considerable individual variation in diet.																	1347-0558					JAN	2015	14	1					3	11		10.2326/osj.14.3							WOS:000349459700002

Reproduction had begun just before the surveys took place, as indicated by the presence of females with attached spermatophores and of larvae. Thirteen-month old females were reproductive. Larvae in 9 depth strata between 0-290 m were dominated by calyptopis stages, and developed from calyptopis 1 to furcilia 1 during November. Larval abundance was not correlated to chlorophyll a concentration, which showed a consistent east-west gradient in Gerlache Strait with highest concentrations (>30 mg chlorophyll a m-3) in bays of the Antarctic Peninsula. Survival of larvae appeared to not be affected by phytoplankton abundance. Older T. macrura showed strong diel vertical migration between the surface at night and depths to 120 m during mid-day. Larvae were consistently found iii the chlorophyll a-rich upper 50 m during night (90%) and day (81%), while adults and juveniles were found in the upper 50 m at night (83%), but only 16% remained there during the day.																	0722-4060					MAY	1994	14	4					219	229									WOS:A1994NL12000001

In the present work, we report the concentrations of hexacorocycohexanes (HCHs), hexachlorobenzene (HCB), and 26 polychlorinated biphenyl (PCBs) congeners in seawater and phytoplankton from samples obtained during three Antarctic cruises 2005,, 2008, and 2009. The levels of PCBs, HCHs, and HCB are low in comparison to the few previous reports for this region and studies from other oceans. The long-term decline of POP concentrations in the Southern Ocean seawater since early 1980 is consistent with half-lives of 3.4 and 5.7 years for HCHs and PCBs, respectively. There is a large variability of PCBs, HCHs, and HCB concentrations in water and phytoplankton within the Bransfield Strait, South Scotia, Weddell, and Bellingshausen Seas that masks the differences between the studied Seas. However, the variability of PCBs concentrations in phytoplankton is significantly correlated with phytoplankton biomass, with lower concentrations in the most productive waters. This trend is more apparent for the more hydrophobic congeners, consistent with the role of settling fluxes of organic matter decreasing the concentrations of hydrophobic POPs in productive waters. The present work reports the most extensive data set on concentrations in Seawater and phytoplankton for the Southern Ocean, and points to the important biogeochemical drivers, such, as settling and degradation, influencing the occurrence of POPs in the ocean.

Results showed a diatom bloom in the Scotia Sea (chlorophyll a 1.9 mu g 1(-1), particulate organic carbon 239 mu g 1(-1)), dominated by Fragilariopsis cylindrus, Dactyliosolen antarcticus and Chaetoceros dichaeta. Low chlorophyll a/phaeopigments ratios (about 1.4) and silicate concentrations (15 mu mol 1(-1)) suggested that this was an advanced bloom phase, probably linked to high grazing pressure. Minimum chlorophyll a values of 0.1-0.2 mu g 1(-1) and particulate organic carbon 46 mu g 1(-1) were found at the Weddell/Scotia Front and in a subsurface layer of the Weddell Sea Water. In the southern part of the transect (61 degrees 30'S), in the Weddell Sea, a second surface maximum was found (chlorophyll a 0.9 mu g 1(-1), particulate organic carbon 120 mu g 1(-1)), but with a different species composition, with Cryptomonas sp. dominant. Our results show a succession within the diatom community in the Weddell/Scotia Confluence Waters when comparing the three EPOS legs. In the Weddell Sea from spring to summer, nanoflagellates, with only a minor contribution from diatoms, persist over a long period with little change in the community structure. We suggest that the frontal system, together with the receding ice edge and the grazing pressure of either krill or protozooplankton, are mainly responsible for the phytoplankton distribution patterns found.

Using fatty acid analysis to elucidate the feeding habits of Southern Ocean mesopelagic fish	MARINE BIOLOGY												Fatty acid biomarkers were used to investigate the feeding ecology of 17 mesopelagic fish species occurring in the Southern Ocean. Fatty acid signatures of species where little or no dietary information exists were compared to fatty acid signatures of species of known diets in order to elucidate their trophic position. Principal component analysis grouped species of known diets into two clusters with amphipods and copepods comprising the main prey species, respectively. Although the majority of species of unknown diet were grouped with either of these feeding guilds, a third cluster comprising only Gymnoscopelus bolini was identified suggesting a significantly different diet for this species. Electrona antarctica also exhibited significant changes in fatty acid signatures with size. Furthermore, discriminant analysis of the four most abundant species classified species with a 90% success rate thus validating the usefulness of fatty acid signatures when trying to resolve the trophic position of species where no or little dietary information exists.				, Martin/ABE-6728-2020; Collins, Martin A/J-8560-2017	Stowasser, Gabriele/0000-0002-0595-0772												0025-3162	1432-1793				OCT	2009	156	11					2289	2302		10.1007/s00227-009-1256-4							WOS:000270180900008

Pyrosequencing faecal DNA to determine diet of little penguins: is what goes in what comes out?	CONSERVATION GENETICS												DNA barcoding of faeces or stomach contents is an emerging approach for dietary analysis. We pyrosequenced mtDNA 16S markers amplified from faeces of captive little penguins (Eudyptula minor) to examine if recovered sequences reflect the proportions of species consumed. We also analysed wild little penguin faeces collected from 100 nests in southeast Australia. In the captive study, pilchards were the primary fish fed to the penguins and DNA sequences from pilchard were the most common sequences recovered. Sequences of three other fish fed in constant mass proportions (45:35:20) were all detected, but proportions of sequences (60:6:34) were considerably different than mass proportions in the diet. Correction factors based on relative mtDNA density in the fish did not improve diet estimates. Consistency between replicate samples suggests that the observed bias resulted from differences in prey digestibility. Detection of DNA from fish consumed before the penguins were brought into captivity indicates that a DNA signal in faeces can persist for at least 4 days after ingestion. In the wild-collected faeces, 24 distinct fish and 1 squid were identified; anchovy, barracouta and pilchard accounted for over 80% of these sequences.

Migratory seabirds are expected to adjust their annual cycle of breeding activities and migratory movements to exploit seasonally available resources efficiently. We studied the movement and trophic position of rhinoceros auklets Cerorhinca monocerata breeding at Teuri Island, Japan Sea, during the nonbreeding and early breeding periods over 2 yr. After breeding, the auklets moved northward from the colony to the Sea of Okhotsk, where phytoplankton blooms enhanced biological productivity in autumn. The birds then moved southward to the southwestern Japan Sea (similar to 1470 km from the colony), where major epipelagic fish and squid concentrations have been reported in winter. Stable isotope analyses suggest that the auklets fed on higher-trophic level prey, including fish and/or squid during the autumn and winter nonbreeding periods. The auklets moved northward and returned to the colony in mid-March. During the early breeding period, the birds foraged close to the colony (similar to 380 km) on lower-trophic level prey including fish and/or krill, which were available during the spring phytoplankton bloom. The timing of the return migration does not match with the northward migration of warm-water anchovy, a profitable prey during summer, but may be related to timing the chick-rearing period to correspond with anchovy arrival. We suggest that rhinoceros auklets follow spatial and seasonal changes in prey availability by a distinctive '3-step' migration (first northward, second southward, third northward) in the temperate marine system of the northwestern Pacific.																	0171-8630	1616-1599				APR 9	2015	525						229	243		10.3354/meps11179							WOS:000354393700018

The lagged effects of environmental changes on penguin abundance are still not well defined. We divided the Ross Sea region into six areas to investigate the effects of environmental changes on penguin abundance from 1982 to 2013. Time lagged analysis of 1-6 years between penguin abundance and environmental factors were conducted in our study. We found that penguin abundance was significantly correlated with environmental factors at different lag times (p < 0.05). The relationship between penguin abundance and environmental factors might differ among regions. Generalized additive model results showed that sea surface temperature negatively affected penguin abundance in most regions of the Ross Sea. In mid-Victoria Land, the relationship between sea-ice concentration and penguin abundance was quadratic. Penguin abundance peaked when sea-ice concentration was approximately 40%. Optimal ranges of environmental factors for Adelie penguin population might exist. Our study highlighted the lagged response of penguin abundance to environmental factors to further understand the effects of climate changes on the Antarctic biosphere.																	0722-4060	1432-2056				NOV	2020	43	11					1769	1781		10.1007/s00300-020-02743-x		SEP 2020					WOS:000569276600001

In seabirds, this segregation may differ over the annual cycle or vary inter-annually. We evaluated niche segregation in 3 sympatric storm-petrel species (Hydrobates melania, H. leucorhous, and H. microsoma) from the San Benito Islands, Mexico, during 2012 and 2013. We used diet samples and carbon (delta C-13) and nitrogen (delta N-15) isotopic values obtained from egg membranes, blood, feathers, and prey. We used krill samples to delineate marine delta C-13 and delta N-15 isoscapes for the Baja California Peninsula. During the breeding season, storm-petrels segregated regarding diet composition, stable isotope values, and isotopic niches. H. melania consumed higher trophic-position prey from neritic waters, while H. leucorhous and H. microsoma foraged on lower-trophic position prey from oceanic waters. Isotopic niches among species did not overlap in 2013, whereas those of H. microsoma and H. leucorhous overlapped in 2012. The feeding strategies of H. melania varied among breeding phases, and adults consumed different prey items from different areas compared to those of their offspring. H. microsoma adults and their chicks consumed the same prey items but from different habitats. During the non-breeding period, niche segregation between species persisted, except for H. microsoma and H. leucorhous during the molt of primary (P1) and undertail cover feathers. These 3 sympatric species coexist through niche segregation based on prey items and foraging areas that vary seasonally and year-round, probably due to changes in oceanographic conditions and the distribution and availability of prey.																	0171-8630	1616-1599				APR 15	2021	664						207	225		10.3354/meps13645							WOS:000644438700013

In this study, we propose to evaluate the interspecies variability of Hg concentrations in phocids from polar areas and to compare Hg bioaccumulation between both hemispheres. Mercury concentrations, delta(15)N and delta(13)C were measured in fur from 85 individuals representing 7 phocidae species, a Ross seal (Ommatophoca rossii), Weddell seals (Leptonychotes weddellii), crabeater seals (Lobodon carcinophagus), harbour seals (Phoca vitulina), grey seals (Halichoerus grypus), ringed seals (Pusa hispida) and a bearded seal (Erignathus barbatus), from Greenland, Denmark and Antarctica. Our results showed a positive correlation between Hg concentrations and delta(15)N values among all individuals. Seals from the Northern ecosystems displayed greater Hg concentrations, delta(15)N and delta(13)C values than those from the Southern waters. Those geographical differences in Hg and stable isotopes values were likely due to higher environmental Hg concentrations and somewhat greater number of steps in Arctic food webs. Moreover, dissimilarities in feeding habits among species were shown through delta(15)N and delta(13)C analysis, resulting in an important interspecific variation in fur Hg concentrations. A trophic segregation was observed between crabeater seals and the other species, resulting from the very specific diet of krill of this species and leading to the lowest observed Hg concentrations.

Abundance and biomass of heterotrophic and autotrophic nanoplankton, as well as bacterioplankton, were determined along a south-north transect from the open waters polynya towards the pack ice. Autotrophic and heterotrophic nanoplankton biomass ranged from 758 to 4570 mgC m(-2) and from 3 to 387 mgC m(-2), respectively. Heterotrophic nanoplankton accounted, on average, for about 9% of the total (i.e. autotrophic plus heterotrophic) nanoplankton biomass, The size structure of both auto- and heterotrophic nanoplankton in the Ross Sea continental shelf receding ice edge was different from that of nanoplankton associated with the shelf break and open Antarctic ice-edge area. Generally, the highest heterotrophic biomass was found in the pack-ice zone on the continental shelf, while the highest heterotrophic contribution to the total nanoplankton biomass (up to 25%) was encountered at the shelf break where phytoplankton was largely dominated by 2- to 3-mu m-size cells.																	0722-4060					NOV	1999	22	5					311	321		10.1007/s003000050424							WOS:000083378800003

Distribution, biomass, demography and feeding ecophysiology	MARINE BIOLOGY												Distribution, density, and feeding dynamics of the pelagic tunicate Salpa thompsoni have been investigated during the expedition ANTARKTIS XVIII/5b to the Eastern Bellingshausen Sea on board RV Polarstern in April 2001. This expedition was the German contribution to the field campaign of the Southern Ocean Global Ocean Ecosystems Dynamics Study (SO-GLOBEC). Salps were found at 31% of all RMT-8 and Bongo stations. Their densities in the RMT-8 samples were low and did not exceed 4.8 ind m(-2) and 7.4 mg C m(-2). However, maximum salp densities sampled with the Bongo net reached 56 ind m(-2) and 341 mg C m(-2). A bimodal salp length frequency distribution was recorded over the shelf, and suggested two recent budding events. This was also confirmed by the developmental stage composition of solitary forms. Ingestion rates of aggregate forms increased from 2.8 to 13.9 mu g (pig) ind(-1) day(-1) or from 0.25 to 2.38 mg C ind(-1) day(-1) in salps from 10 to 40 mm oral-atrial length, accounting for 25-75% of body carbon per day. Faecal pellet production rates were on average 0.08 pellet ind(-1) h(-1) with a pronounced diel pattern. Daily individual egestion rates in 13 and 30 mm aggregates ranged from 0.6 to 4.8 mu g (pig) day(-1) or from 164 to 239 mu g C day(-1). Assimilation efficiency ranged from 73 to 90% and from 65 to 76% in 13 and 30 mm aggregates, respectively. S. thompsoni exhibited similar ingestion and egestion rates previously estimated for low Antarctic (similar to 50 degrees S) habitats. It has been suggested that the salp population was able to develop in the Eastern Bellingshausen Sea due to an intrusion into the area of the warm Upper Circumpolar Deep Water					Strass, Volker/0000-0002-7539-1400												0025-3162					JUN	2006	149	3					609	623		10.1007/s00227-005-0225-9							WOS:000238327200018						
J	Kendall, KA; Ruhl, HA; Wilson, RC				Kendall, KA; Ruhl, HA; Wilson, RC			Distribution and abundance of marine bird and pinniped populations within Port Foster, Deception Island, Antarctica	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY												Seabirds and pinnipeds were surveyed during four cruises from March 1999 to November 2000 at Port Foster, Deception Island, Antarctica. Abundances and distributions of three species of pinnipeds, Arctocephalus gazella (Antarctic fur seals), Leptonychotes weddelli (Weddell seals), and Lobodon carcinophagus (crabeater seals), and 11 species of marine birds were documented within Port Foster. A. gazella was the dominant pinniped within Port Foster; its abundance has increased since the 1986/87 austral summer season. A. gazella were concentrated at the entrance to Port Foster. More pinnipeds were observed during the austral summer than during the spring. The most dominant seabird, Pygoscelis antarctica (chinstrap penguin), was concentrated along the rocky cliffs behind the beaches where A. gazella hauled out. Larus dominicanus (kelp gull) and Daption capense (cape petrel) were the most dominant flying seabirds. All other seabird species were more widely distributed around Port Foster than P. antarctica. There was no clear trend in abundances of seabirds over the study period. It is possible that the protected area of Port Foster provides refuge for vagrants of colonies along the outer periphery of the island and as a stopover point for migrating species.

J	Demer, DA; Soule, MA; Hewitt, RP				Demer, DA; Soule, MA; Hewitt, RP			A multiple-frequency method for potentially improving the accuracy and precision of in situ target strength measurements	JOURNAL OF THE ACOUSTICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA												The effectiveness of a split-beam echosounder system to reject echoes from unresolvable scatterers, thereby improving the measurements of in situ target strengths (TS) of individuals, is dramatically enhanced by combining synchronized signals from two or more adjacent split-beam transducers of different frequencies. The accuracy and precision of the method was determined through simulations and controlled test tank experiments using multiple standard spheres and 38- and 120-kHz split-beam echosounders. By utilizing the angular positional information from one of the split-beam transducers, additional corresponding TS measurements were shown to be obtainable from a juxtaposed single-beam transducer. Both methods were utilized to extract in situ TS measurements of Antarctic scatterers simultaneously at 38, 120, and 200 kHz. The ultimate efficiency of the multiple-frequency method is shown to be limited by phase measurement precision, which in turn is limited by the scattering complexity of targets, the signal-to-noise ratio, and the receiver bandwidth. Imprecise phase measurements also result in significant beam-compensation uncertainty in split-beam measurements. Differences in multi-frequency TS measurements provided information about the identity of constituents in a mixed species assemblage. The taxa delineation method has potential, but is limited by compounding measurement uncertainties at the individual frequencies and sparse spectral sampling. (C) 1999 Acoustical Society of America.

School characteristics of mesopelagic fish at South Georgia	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART I-OCEANOGRAPHIC RESEARCH PAPERS												In this paper, we describe the variation in myctophid schools characteristics at South Georgia using multifrequency acoustic data collected annually between November 2007 and January 2012. We studied the relationship between the proximity of land and the distribution and schooling characteristics of myctophid fish. We also examined patterns in schooling behaviour in relation to oceanographic data. Fish schools were identified using a dual-frequency dB identification method (Sv120-38 kHz), where negative Sv120-38 kHz is indicative of gas-bearing organisms, such as swimbladdered fish. Available net data were used to provide information on the meosopelagic fish community in the region. School morphometrics (e.g. length, thickness, area) data were extracted and pooled according to their distance from the shore (0-30 km, 30-60 km, 60-90 km, 90-120 km). A total of 578 schools were detected in the survey region and there was high variation in school backscattering strength (NASC), length, height, perimeter, depth and horizontal distribution between surveys, including distinct inter-annual variation in these parameters when surveys were conducted in the same season (2009-2012). Schools were distributed predominantly on-shelf (0-500 m isobaths) during some summer surveys (2007 and 2012) and predominantly off-shelf on others ( > 500 m isobaths; 2009,2010 and 2011). There was also evidence of bathymetric separation in the horizontal distribution of schools. Schools observed in the late-season in 2008 had the greatest NASC, largest height and the deepest depth distribution. Most schools occurred at depths between similar to 60 and 300 m, but they did not occupy the same water masses during each survey. Schools became progressively thinner, shallower and acoustically weaker with increasing distance to land, whilst school length and perimeter increased correspondingly. The change in fish schooling behaviour between environments could be a response to a combination of local predatory threats over short spatial/temporal scales and differences in oceanographic conditions, such as current velocity. The trend could also be evidence of spatial habitat partitioning of myctophids, with different schooling species, or different life-stages, orientating along a bathymetric gradient at South Georgia.

Integrating oxidative ecology into conservation physiology	CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY												Ecologists have recently shown great interest in using physiological markers as indicators of the health of animal populations. In this context, the measurement of markers of oxidative balance, such as antioxidant defences and oxidative damage, may be a valuable tool. Indeed, at the individual level, antioxidant defences are positively associated with fertility and survival probability, while elevated oxidative damage during reproduction or growth may negatively affect recruitment and survival. Therefore, variation in oxidative balance is likely to influence demographic processes. This suggests that conservationists may be able to use oxidative markers to monitor population health. Yet, the connection between these markers and demographic parameters first needs to be established. We present here preliminary results obtained in colonies of breeding Gentoo (Pygoscelis papua) and Adelie penguins (Pygoscelis adeliae), showing that antioxidant defences strongly reflect population trends. However, population trend was not related to oxidative damage. This suggests that in the context of the emerging field of conservation physiology, antioxidant defences may represent a key parameter to monitor population health. We therefore exhort other research teams to assess the generality of this finding in other biological models, especially in species of conservation concern.

The evolutionary relationships between and within the eight families of this suborder have been well established by numerous studies, whereas the microevolutionary processes of notothenioid species remain largely unexplored. In the present paper we investigated the evolutionary relationships between three closely related species of the genus Chionadraco (family Channichthyidae), namely Chionodraco hamatus, Chionodraco rastrospinosus, and Chionodraco myersi by analysing portions of the mitochondrial genome (D-loop and 16S rRNA). The taxonomic status of C. hamatus and C. rastrospinostis as separate species has been questioned because of the limited number of key morphological characters that distinguish these two taxa. Our results, based on the analysis of several specimens belonging to both morphological groups revealed a small genetic differentiation among haplotypes, however, a clear separation between the two nominal species emerged since all individuals of each of the two taxa clustered together in distinct monophyletic groups. C. myersi appeared more distantly related in the phylogenetic analysis. For one, species, C. hamatus, sampling was carried out at three different geographic locations in the area of the Ross Sea and Weddell Sea. The results showed that the partition of the genetic variation within this species is not compatible with the hypothesis of panmixia as gene flow between populations was significantly reduced.

Copepods were found to be the most conspicuous grazers along the entire transect, generally accounting for approximate to 40% of total zooplankton grazing. Pelagic pteropods, Limacina helicina and Clio sulcata, were the second most important grazers within the Seasonal Ice Edge (SIE) region, while the tunicate Salpa thompsoni and euphausiids, mainly Euphausia superba and E. frigida, were the second and third most important consumers of the phytoplankton production within the Winter Ice Edge (WIE) and Antarctic Polar Front (APF) regions. The overall ingestion rates of the zooplankton community ranged from 24 to 277mg Cm-2 day(-1). The lowest and highest ingestion rates were recorded within the SIE and APF regions. The zooplankton grazing impact was low within the SIE region accounting for < 10% of daily primary production. The highest phytoplankton consumption rate (56% of daily primary production) was observed in the WIE region, while the APF region was characterized by modest (23-33%) grazing impact of zooplankton.

J	Huin, N; Prince, PA; Briggs, DR				Huin, N; Prince, PA; Briggs, DR			Chick provisioning rates and growth in Black-browed Albatross Diomedea melanophris and Grey-headed Albatross D. chrysostoma at Bird Island, South Georgia	IBIS												We compared the parental division of labour and the pattern and rate of parental provisioning by two sympatric species of albatross of similar mass and breeding timetable but differing in diet and in the duration of chick-rearing. Using electronic weighing platforms inside artificial nests, we recorded chick mass of Black-browed Albatross and Grey-headed Albatross at Bird Island, South Georgia every 10 minutes for both species in 1993 and 1994 and for each species in two other years between 1990 and 1996. The chick mass data (nearly one million weighings) were used to calculate meal mass (over 5000 meals) and intervals between meals. Adult birds were fitted with radio-transmitters which allowed each meal to be allocated to the appropriate parent. The combination of meal mass and foraging trip duration were used to calculate provisioning rates for chicks and individual adults. Overall, Black-browed Albatrosses delivered significantly lighter meals (569 g) than Grey-headed Albatrosses (616 g) but more frequently (every 2.07 days and 2.50 days respectively). Thus combining foraging trip data for both parents, Black-browed Albatross chicks received a meal every 1.22 days compared with 1.26 days for Grey-headed Albatross. These rates did not differ significantly. The contribution of each sex of each species in chick provisioning fluctuated between years, being similar in some years or biased towards males in others. Chicks of both species that failed to fledge received smaller, less frequent meals than successful chicks. In 1990 and 1994, Black-browed Albatross chick provisioning rates were lower than in 1992 and 1993. In 1990, both meal mass and trip duration were affected, but only in 1994 was trip duration longer. Grey-headed Albatross chick provisioning rate was lower in 1994 than in other years but trip duration was longer. In each species, significant changes in meal mass and trip duration occurred within the chick-rearing period. Chick provisioning rates invariably declined before chicks attained their peak mass. For both species, chick growth rates and peak and fledging mass, but not fledging age, were affected by differences in provisioning rate.																	0019-1019	1474-919X				OCT	2000	142	4					550	565		10.1111/j.1474-919X.2000.tb04456.x							WOS:000089667700002						
J	Plaganyi, EE				Plaganyi, Eva Elizabeth			FITTING THE PUZZLE-MODELING SPECIES INTERACTIONS IN MARINE ECOSYSTEMS	BULLETIN OF MARINE SCIENCE												Understanding the complex trophic interactions among species in an ecosystem involves solving the puzzle describing the ecosystem structure and functioning. The choice of interaction formulation fundamentally influences ecosystem model conclusions and therefore the usefulness of management advice. I reviewed existing methods for modeling species interactions in marine ecosystems, ranging from process models to statistical models that are fitted to data. An Antarctic multispecies simulation model was used to explore the responses of predators to perturbations in prey, as well as the poorly understood phenomenon of abrupt prey switching. Relatively simple tractable models that had been ground-truthed with data and quantified the slope of the interaction relationship showed considerable potential for elucidating the outcomes of species interactions that are difficult to measure directly in the field. Models must integrate changes in vital rates through to population and community-level changes (the scale needed for management). Abrupt prey switching by a predator to prey species A when prey species B decreased to a threshold level could mediate a dramatic decline in prey species B, as well as greatly facilitated the subsequent recovery of prey species A. Whether or not prey switching occurred, and whether it was step-wise or gradual, had a marked impact on the rate of recovery of the prey species, as well as interlinked predators. Recovery times predicted by the multispecies model were longer than those from single-species models. Increasing understanding and quantification of species interactions is crucial to advancing an ecosystem approach to fisheries management.

Zinc isotope fractionation analyses by thermal ionization mass spectrometry and a double spiking technique	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MASS SPECTROMETRY												The aim of this work was to develop thermal ionization mass spectrometry (TIMS) isotopic procedures to measure Zn isotope fractionation (delta Zn) in natural materials. This work represents the most recent development of Zn isotope measurements and the first delta Zn identification in terrestrial materials using TIMS and a double spike technique. The developed procedures evaluate and solve several critical analytical issues involved in TIMS Zn isotope analysis. For example, no more than 1 mu g Zn was used for isotopic analyses which, considering the high ionization potential and low thermal ionization of Zn, represents a useful breakthrough in Zn isotope TIMS analysis. The effect of the ion exchange process on delta Zn was assessed and found equal to +0.07 +/- 0.02 parts per thousand amu(-1) per column. The ionization efficiency of Zn was enhanced to 0.22 +/- 0.07%, which is four times more than what was achieved previously. The magnitude of delta Zn accompanied by the 95% confidence associated uncertainties were calculated relative to the IRMM 3702, using a Monte Carlo approach for each individual analysis, while the calculated average of delta Zn for number of analysis was accompanied by a 95% confidence calculated using GUM Workbench software. delta Zn values where always calculated using two different sets of isotopes which always agreed within uncertainty. These developments enabled sub-per mil delta Zn to be revealed relative to delta Zn zero for natural materials. Most of the samples measured are Standard Reference Materials SRMs, where, except for BCR-1 and BIR-1, this is the first time Zn isotopic fractionation has been measured in these samples. No previously published results for Zn isotopic fractionation have been published on these samples using double spiking. Consistent delta Zn of similar to+ 0.3 parts per thousand amu(-1) was found in 5 sediments from a range of localities. delta Zn in two metamorphic samples is similar to that found in igneous rocks but different to that found in sedimentary rocks, which is consistent with our understanding that high temperature and pressure processes do not fractionate the composition of chalcophile elements. The isotope fractionation of Zn in a clay sample is within uncertainties the same as the sediments. The isotope fractionation of Zn of -0.088 +/- 0.070 parts per thousand amu(-1) was also measured in a standard rice sample. delta Zn in Antarctic Krill of +0.21 +/- 0.11 parts per thousand amu(-1) was found to be similar to the average delta Zn of +0.281 +/- 0.083 parts per thousand amu(-1) for marine sediments. River water was fractionated by -1.09 +/- 0.70 parts per thousand amu(-1), while restrained tap water yielded the maximum isotope fractionation of -6.39 +/- 0.62 parts per thousand amu(-1). delta Zn in high pure Zn standard materials ranged from 5.11 +/- 0.36 parts per thousand amu(-1) for AE 10760 to +0.12 +/- 0.16 parts per thousand amu(-1) for Zn IRMM 10440 with some evidence for a relationship between Zn isotope fractionation and its purity. All of the measured isotope fractionation yields an atomic weight within the IUPAC atomic weight of Zn. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Physical properties and processes in the Perth Canyon, Western Australia: Links to water column production and seasonal pygmy blue whale abundance	JOURNAL OF MARINE SYSTEMS												The oceanography of the Perth Canyon, off southwestern Australia, was examined through two major field excursions in austral spring/summer 2003/2004 combined with previous results from field analysis and numerical simulations. Water properties were used to identify water masses and vertical displacement. The field cruises and numerical simulation indicated unique circulation features of the Leeuwin Current and Undercurrent within the canyon associated with the topographic features. The input of nutrients to the euphotic zone occurred sporadically as the Leeuwin Current generally suppressed upwelling, although the Perth Canyon had increased nutrient concentrations within its rims. The distribution of chlorophyll in the surface layers indicated high spatial variability, with a prevalent deep chlorophyll (and phytoplankton biomass) maximum at similar to 80 m. Depth-integrated primary production within the study region ranged from 360 to 760 mg C m(-2) d(-1), which was on average 2.5 times higher than rates measured in continental shelf and offshore waters north of the canyon. Aggregations of krill and other acoustic backscatter targets were concentrated near the head of the canyon at a range of depths, which may have been promoted by the circulation. The findings here are consistent with seasonal variations in wind and insolation, along with variations in the Leeuwin Current, influencing the seasonal changes and mesoscale features within the region, while the canyon promotes localised upwelling, and enhances both pelagic production and physical aggregation of plankton to attract the whales. Canyon processes must be combined with outside factors to allow upwelled nutrients to reach the photic zone. It is concluded that a combination of factors, rather than one factor alone, contributes favourably to the appearance of feeding blue whales in the Perth Canyon during the summer.

Predicting the future is hard and other lessons from a population time series data science competition	ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS												Population forecasting, in which past dynamics are used to make predictions of future state, has many real-world applications. While time series of animal abundance are often modeled in ways that aim to capture the underlying biological processes involved, doing so is neither necessary nor sufficient for making good predictions. Here we report on a data science competition focused on modelling time series of Antarctic penguin abundance. We describe the best performing submitted models and compare them to a Bayesian model previously developed by domain experts and build an ensemble model that outperforms the individual component models in prediction accuracy. The top performing models varied tremendously in model complexity, ranging from very simple forward extrapolations of average growth rate to ensembles of models integrating recently developed machine learning techniques. Despite the short time frame for the competition, four of the submitted models outperformed the model previously created by the team of domain experts. We discuss the structure of the best performing models and components therein that might be useful for other ecological applications, the benefit of creating ensembles of models for ecological prediction, and the costs and benefits of including detailed domain expertise in ecological modelling. Additionally, we discuss the benefits of data science competitions, among which are increased visibility for challenging science questions, the generation of new techniques not yet adopted within the ecological community, and the ability to generate ensemble model forecasts that directly address model uncertainty.

Habitat preferences of Adelie Pygoscelis adeliae and Chinstrap Penguins Pygoscelis antarctica during pre-moult in the Weddell Sea (Southern Ocean)	POLAR BIOLOGY												In order to understand and mitigate for the potential impacts of anthropogenic disturbance on marine predators, it is fundamental to gain insight into the drivers behind the temporal variation in their current distribution. With this in mind, we used platform terminal transmitter devices to track Adelie Pygoscelis adeliae and Chinstrap Penguins Pygoscelis antarctica breeding on the South Orkney Islands during the pre-moult phase of their annual cycles. We show that Adelie Penguins have an affinity to foragenear and moult on sea-ice, and that Chinstraps remain over the shallower shelf waters during pre-moult, and return to the colony to moult. However, habitat models developed to predict the preferred foraging habitats of penguins during pre-moult had low predictive power. This indicates that predictive models may be insufficient to understand the distribution and foraging behaviour of penguins during certain stages of the life-cycle, and that collecting empirical data from individual colonies or archipelagos is vital if we are to understand the potential implications of future climate warming, or indeed the overlap with potentially competing fisheries.																	0722-4060	1432-2056				APR	2019	42	4					703	714		10.1007/s00300-019-02465-9							WOS:000461817700005

Sex-Based Differences in Adelie Penguin (Pygoscelis adeliae) Chick Growth Rates and Diet	PLOS ONE												Sexually size-dimorphic species must show some difference between the sexes in growth rate and/or length of growing period. Such differences in growth parameters can cause the sexes to be impacted by environmental variability in different ways, and understanding these differences allows a better understanding of patterns in productivity between individuals and populations. We investigated differences in growth rate and diet between male and female Adelie Penguin (Pygoscelis adeliae) chicks during two breeding seasons at Cape Crozier, Ross Island, Antarctica. Adelie Penguins are a slightly dimorphic species, with adult males averaging larger than adult females in mass (similar to 11%) as well as bill (similar to 8%) and flipper length (similar to 3%). We measured mass and length of flipper, bill, tibiotarsus, and foot at 5-day intervals for 45 male and 40 female individually-marked chicks. Chick sex was molecularly determined from feathers. We used linear mixed effects models to estimate daily growth rate as a function of chick sex, while controlling for hatching order, brood size, year, and potential variation in breeding quality between pairs of parents. Accounting for season and hatching order, male chicks gained mass an average of 15.6 g d(-1) faster than females. Similarly, growth in bill length was faster for males, and the calculated bill size difference at fledging was similar to that observed in adults. There was no evidence for sex-based differences in growth of other morphological features. Adelie diet at Ross Island is composed almost entirely of two species-one krill (Euphausia crystallorophias) and one fish (Pleura-gramma antarctica), with fish having a higher caloric value. Using isotopic analyses of feather samples, we also determined that male chicks were fed a higher proportion of fish than female chicks. The related differences in provisioning and growth rates of male and female offspring provides a greater understanding of the ways in which ecological factors may impact the two sexes differently.

Low trophic level diet of juvenile southern elephant seals Mirounga leonina from Marion Island: a stable isotope investigation using vibrissal regrowths	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												Insight into the trophic ecology of marine predators is vital for understanding their ecosystem role and predicting their responses to environmental change. Juvenile southern elephant seals (SES) Mirounga leonina are considered generalist predators within the Southern Ocean. Although mesopelagic fish and squid dominate their stomach lavage samples, the stable isotope profile captured along the length of sampled vibrissae of young SES at Macquarie Island, southwest Pacific Ocean (54.5 degrees S, 158.9 degrees E) recently emphasized the contribution of crustaceans to their diet (likely Euphausia superba). Herein, we used the stable isotope values of sampled vibrissal regrowths with known growth histories to assess the diet of juvenile SES at Marion Island, southern Indian Ocean (46.8 degrees S, 37.8 degrees E) on a temporally integrated basis. We specifically aimed to quantify the possible contribution of crustaceans to the diet of juvenile SES. Sequentially (chronologically) sampled vibrissal regrowths of 14 juvenile SES produced fine-scale dietary information spanning up to 9 mo. The depleted stable isotope signatures of nitrogen (delta N-15) (8.5 +/- 0.6 parts per thousand) and carbon (delta C-13) (-20.3 +/- 0.1 parts per thousand) measured during the period of independent foraging suggested the use of a lower trophic level diet within the Polar Frontal Zone. A mixing model predicted that up to 76% of juvenile SES diet comprised crustaceans, consisting of 2 crustacean groups, each contributing 26% (credible interval, CI: 13-39%) and 50% (CI: 35-64%) to their diets, presumably representing subantarctic krill species. This first utilisation of the isotopic signature captured along the length of vibrissal regrowths confirms the inclusion and importance of crustaceans in the diet of juvenile SES.

In the study area, near the South Orkneys (34-49-degrees-W, 57-61.5-degrees-S), water emerging from the Weddell Sea mixed with Scotia Sea water to form a complex field of mesoscale eddies and meanders. Three primary zooplankton communities were identified: a shallow cold water assemblage typical of Weddell Sea water; a shallow/upper mesopelagic assemblage of subantarctic species introduced into the southern Scotia Sea with warm core eddies from the Polar Front; and a deep (>400 m) mesopelagic community with circumantarctic species. Zooplankton numerical dominants were cyclopoid copepods (mostly Oithona spp.); biomass dominants were four calanoid copepods, Calanoides acutus, Rhincalanus gigas, Calanus propinquus and Metridia gerlachei. Calanoides acutus and R. gigas were undergoing winter diapause in the mesopelagic zone (>400 m) whereas M. gerlachei and C. propinquus were distributed throughout the water column. In the subantarctic eddies M. gerlachei was replaced by M. lucens as a dominant and R. gigas was more abundant than in cold water to the south. Diet analysis of 35 dominant species revealed five feeding guilds among the zooplankton. One consisted primarily of small herbivorous copepods. Two closely related guilds consisting of copepods, krill and salps were omnivorous, feeding on phytoplankton, protozoans, metazoans and crustacean debris (molts). Two guilds were constituted by predatory copepods and chaetognaths. A sixth group, all copepods, which included important numerical and biomass dominants of the region, was trophically inactive. A comparison of gut fullness between winter 1988 and fall 1986 revealed that all but two of 19 small particle grazing species had significantly less food in their guts in winter. The exceptions were the biomass dominants C. propinquus and M. gerlachei, which were actively feeding in winter. Phytoplankton biomass was low in winter, averaging two-thirds that in fall. Several major trophic pathways from phytoplankton through apex predators (birds and mammals) are proposed for winter in the southern Scotia Sea with zooplankton playing a central role in each.																	0967-0637					JAN	1993	40	1					81	105		10.1016/0967-0637(93)90054-7							WOS:A1993KJ94900005

Spatio-temporal distribution and abundance of Euphausia crystallorophias in Terra Nova Bay (Ross Sea, Antarctica) during austral summer	POLAR BIOLOGY												Average abundance values for Euphausia crystallorophias in the shelf region of Terra Nova Bay were generally high. Mean number of adults and juveniles were 20 and 87 ind/m(2), respectively, while larval concentrations were much higher, reaching a mean of 14,764 ind/m(2). Euphausia crystallorophias were very patchy in their distribution during all stages of their life cycle. The distribution patterns of E. crystallorophias in TNB seem to be strictly correlated both to hydrological features such as the presence of polynyas, pack-ice zone and certain temperatures values. According to our data, E. crystallorophias spawned from early October to early January. For the two age groups (0+ and 1+) an average growth rate of 0.074 and 0.076 mm/day was found, respectively.

Concentrations of silicic acid, nitrate and phosphate (Si/N/P) were measured in the upper water column during January-March of three successive years. samples were taken from eleven depths at 17 stations in 1991, and at four depths at 144 stations in 1992 and 182 stations in 1993. There was considerable variability in the concentrations of all three nutrients within the study area, but silicic acid showed the greatest variance among the water masses present in the sampling grid. The ratios (SI/N/P) of the nutrient deficits (difference in winter and summer values) in the upper 100 m differed considerably in Drake Passage waters as compared to Bransfield Strait waters, with both nitrate and silicic acid showing the greatest variance. Nutrient deficits did not increase from January to February, indicating that rates of replenishment of nutrients to the euphotic zone by physical processes and/or biological regeneration were approximately equal to the rate of uptake and assimilation by phytoplankton during that time period. The seasonal deficits, however, were substantial. Estimates of daily rates of primary production based on these nutrient deficits were comparable to the rates as measured by radiocarbon for Drake Passage waters, but much smaller for Bransfield Strait waters.

Understanding the demographic response of free-living animal populations to different drivers is the first step towards reliable prediction of population trends. 2. Penguins have exhibited dramatic declines in population size, and many studies have linked this to bottom-up processes altering the abundance of prey species. The effects of individual traits have been considered to a lesser extent, and top-down regulation through predation has been largely overlooked due to the difficulties in empirically measuring this at sea where it usually occurs. 3. For 10 years (2003-2012), macaroni penguins (Eudyptes chrysolophus) were marked with subcutaneous electronic transponder tags and re-encountered using an automated gateway system fitted at the entrance to the colony. We used multistate mark-recapture modelling to identify the different drivers influencing survival rates and a sensitivity analysis to assess their relative importance across different life stages. 4. Survival rates were low and variable during the fledging year (mean = 0.33), increasing to much higher levels from age 1 onwards (mean = 0.89). We show that survival of macaroni penguins is driven by a combination of individual quality, top-down predation pressure and bottom-up environmental forces. The relative importance of these covariates was age specific. During the fledging year, survival rates were most sensitive to top-down predation pressure, followed by individual fledging mass, and finally bottom-up environmental effects. In contrast, birds older than 1 year showed a similar response to bottom-up environmental effects and top-down predation pressure. 5. We infer from our results that macaroni penguins will most likely be negatively impacted by an increase in the local population size of giant petrels. Furthermore, this population is, at least in the short term, likely to be positively influenced by local warming. More broadly, our results highlight the importance of considering multiple causal effects across different life stages when examining the survival rates of seabirds.

J	North, AW				North, AW			Mackerel icefish size and age differences and long-term change at South Georgia and Shag Rocks	JOURNAL OF FISH BIOLOGY												This study analysed the total length (L-T)-frequency distribution of mackerel icefish Champsocephalus gunnari at South Georgia and Shag Rocks from nine bottom trawl surveys at South Georgia and eight at Shag Rocks between 1987 and 2002. The estimated mean L-T of age-classes 1+, 2+ 3+ and 4+ years during January were, respectively, 14.7, 23.5,29.8 and 35.1 cm at South Georgia. Age-classes 1+, 2+ and 3+ years were 18.3, 26.2 and 33.8 cm at Shag Rocks. The derived Bertalanffy growth parameters for South Georgia were: L-infinity = 51.7 cm, k = 0.27 and to = -0.26. The mean L-T of each age-class of C. gunnari at Shag Rocks was significantly larger than at South Georgia, equivalent to c. 5 months growth, although the annual growth in L-T was similar. This is further evidence that C. gunnari hatched earlier at Shag Rocks. At South Georgia, the mean L-T of age-classes 1+ and 3+ years were correlated, and significantly decreased between 1987 and 2002, and were smaller following warmer summers.

A comparison of the catching ability of a Bongo net (mesh aperture 200 mu m) and a reconstructed version of an N70 net (upper mesh aperture 445 mu m, lower mesh aperture 195 mu m) as used by the Discovery Investigations was therefore undertaken. Forty Bongo and forty N70 samples were obtained from 10 stations in the Southern Ocean during December 2009. Bongo net catch abundance was similar to 3 times greater than the N70 and similar to 4 times greater when only copepod instars < 0.5 mm body length were considered. The Bongo net captured more plankton at all chlorophyll a (Chl a) concentrations encountered, although the difference was less at high Chl a when the N70 appeared to filter all size classes of copepod more efficiently, as well as retaining a relatively greater proportion of non-copepod plankton. Application of these findings was made to a previous study in which N70 samples from 1926/1927 were compared to a series of Bongo net hauls made post-1995. By 'correcting' abundances for net bias among a common set of 45 taxa, N70 data were within the range of variability seen in the Bongo net samples. Making such inter-net comparisons allows us to use historical collections and better judge the nature and magnitude of change in these plankton communities.																	0722-4060	1432-2056				AUG	2012	35	8					1179	1186		10.1007/s00300-012-1163-x							WOS:000306345800004						
J	Irvine, LG; Clarke, JR; Kerry, KR				Irvine, LG; Clarke, JR; Kerry, KR			Low breeding success of the Adelie penguin at Bechervaise Island in the 1998/99 season	CCAMLR SCIENCE												This paper describes the diet and foraging behaviour of Adelie penguins (Pygoscelis adeliae) at Bechervaise Island during 1998/99, a season of low breeding success. Fifty-six percent of nests with eggs failed during the three weeks following first hatch. A breeding success of 0.43 chicks creched per nest was achieved, compared to previous seasons with higher annual breeding success rates ranging from 0.69 to 1.06 chicks creched per nest. Evidence from analyses of foraging location, foraging trip duration and diet suggests that the death of chicks during the guard stage was due to an inadequate rate of food supply. In most previous seasons adults have foraged both at the continental shelf edge (particularly females) and locally (particularly males). This season male penguins carried out fewer local trips and both sexes spent longer at sea than in years of higher breeding success. Meal masses brought back to the chicks were within the normal range but extended foraging trip durations reduced feeding frequency. These findings contrast with observations made in 1994/95 (a season in which all chicks died of starvation), when smaller meals were delivered and birds foraged further offshore than in this or any other season studied. The significance to CCAMLR of these variations in foraging behaviour is discussed.																	1023-4063						2000	7						151	167									WOS:000166295500009						
J	Daponte, MC; Capitanio, FL; Esnal, GB				Daponte, MC; Capitanio, FL; Esnal, GB			A mechanism for swarming in the tunicate Salpa thompsoni (Foxton, 1961)	ANTARCTIC SCIENCE												Two populations of Salpa thompsoni, collected from the Weddell-Scotia confluencc area at the end of two summers (1994 and 1995) with contrasting densities, are compared. The present study was aimed at corroborating whether fluctuations in abundance could be related to sonic life history parameters considered as indicators of growth rate in salp populations, such as the body size of solitary reproductive individuals, number of buds per block or chain in the stolon, and the offspring to parent ratio. No differences were observed in the sizes reached by aggregate individuals, or in the size at which oocyte maturity was attained (moment at which the development of the embryo can be detected). There were no differences in the size reached by the embryos during their residence inside the mother's blastozooid. In 1995, the percentage of non-fecundated blastozooids (which included even the largest individuals) was higher than in 1994. The mean size of the solitary individuals was significantly higher in 1994 than in 1995. The number of buds per block was also significantly higher in most of the stages, confirming that this is the mechanism used by these organisms to produce swarms. This species eventually attains high population densities under favourable environmental conditions such as poor sea-ice cover in winter. Under optimal conditions, the number of potential descendants produced by a single solitary individual would exceed 800.

J	MARCHAL, E; GERLOTTO, F; STEQUERT, B				MARCHAL, E; GERLOTTO, F; STEQUERT, B			ON THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN SCATTERING LAYER, THERMAL STRUCTURE AND TUNA ABUNDANCE IN THE EASTERN ATLANTIC EQUATORIAL CURRENT SYSTEM	OCEANOLOGICA ACTA												A migrating Sound Scattering Layer (SSL) was observed in the Eastern Atlantic equatorial system during warm and cool seasons. Averaged column scattering strength was nearly the same during daytime at 350-400 m depth and during night-time close to the surface. The depth of the nocturnal SSL was correlated with the depth of the thermocline. In the warm stable season, the maximum column scattering strength was found south of the equator in a dome shaped structure. In the cool season, the maximum was found at the northern convergence where the thermocline was well-marked, whereas upwelled waters were acoustically poor. For the warm season, this pattern is consistent with the distribution of chlorophyll, zooplankton and micronekton. For the cool season, it fits also rather well, except for the net-sampled micronekton : this discrepancy could be related to the poor efficiency of the net in sampling adequately a thin layer. Finally, SSL strength coincides well with tuna catch distribution in this area, suggesting a trophic relationship.																	0399-1784						1993	16	3					261	272									WOS:A1993LX70000006

Abundance and distribution of invertebrate larvae in the Bellingshausen Sea (West Antarctica)	POLAR BIOLOGY												The central part of the Bellingshausen Sea has been poorly studied, partly because of the presence of ice during most of the year. The main aim of this study was to analyse the abundance and distribution of meroplankton, and the influence of oceanographic properties were investigated in the Bellingshausen Sea (West Antarctica) during the BENTART-06 cruise carried out in January-February 2006. Zooplankton samples were collected with a 80-mu m mesh plankton net hauled vertically from a depth of 200 m to the surface at fifteen stations across the Bellingshausen Sea. Fifteen types of larval benthic invertebrates were found, with echinospira and nudibranch veligers being the most abundant. Hierarchical analysis and non-metric multidimensional scaling revealed a high degree of spatial variability in both larval abundance and larval types across the Bellingshausen Sea. The variability was significantly correlated with total chlorophyll-a and the contribution of large (> 5 mu m) phytoplankton to total chlorophyll, indicating the availability of food as an important factor determining the larval distribution observed. Nudibranch veligers, nemertean pilidia, echinoderm and planula larvae were more abundant at stations in the central Bellingshausen Sea, which was characterized by low phytoplankton biomass and production. Higher abundances of echinospira veligers and polychaete larvae were found at the more productive stations close to Peter I Island and the Antarctic Peninsula. The abundance and diversity of larval types found in the Bellingshausen Sea during the BENTART-06 cruise support the hypothesis that indirect development through larval swimming stages plays a key role in benthic recruitment in polar areas.

Several authors have discussed factors in addition to diet that might contribute to variability in delta(15)N of consumers, but few studies have explored such factors in detail. For a better understanding of tissue-specific differences in delta(15)N, we examined postlarval euphausiids across a variety of seasons and regions in the Southern Ocean. The concentration and delta(15)N of individual amino acids were analysed to account for both the biochemical and physiological underpinnings of the observed bulk delta(15)N. Euphausiids showed consistent d(15)N differences of 1 to 2 parts per thousand between the digestive gland and abdominal segment, and between reproductively active males and females. These differences in bulk delta(15)N were accompanied by variations in relative proportions of amino acids (up to 5 mol %) and their delta(15)N (up to 11parts per thousand). Aspartic acid and glutamic acid had the strongest influence on bulk delta(15)N, due to their high abundance and variable delta(15)N values. Differences in relative proportions and/or delta(15)N of glycine and alanine were also important for bulk delta(15)N values. Isotopic variations in amino acids between gender and tissues were explained by dominant internal processes such as protein synthesis or degradation for energy supply, and by differences in amino acid pool sizes. Despite the offset in bulk delta(15)N between females and males, several lines of evidence suggested that their trophic levels were similar. Thus, specific amino acid composition and metabolism may confound trophic level interpretations of bulk delta(15)N values. Micronekton are normally analyzed whole in isotopic studies, and we suggest that their analyses should be restricted to comparable tissues such as muscles.

J	Richoux, NB				Richoux, Nicole B.			Trophic ecology of zooplankton at a frontal transition zone: fatty acid signatures at the subtropical convergence, Southern Ocean	JOURNAL OF PLANKTON RESEARCH												Regional variations in fatty acid composition were assessed in zooplankton communities situated immediately north and south of the subtropical convergence (STC), where warm (maximum 21 degrees C) nutrient-poor waters of the southwest Indian Ocean converge with cool (minimum 11 degrees C) nutrient-rich subantarctic waters of the Southern Ocean. I hypothesized that food web structures differ from north to south based on average spatial differences in primary productivity, and that zooplankton in the more productive region show enhanced herbivorous feeding. Several taxonomic groups including euphausiids showed differences in their fatty acid signatures from north to south, indicating the existence of measurable within- and among-species differences in trophic relationships between the two communities, presumably stemming from variations in food quality and availability. The indices 22:6 omega 3/20:5 omega 3, 18:1 omega 9/18:1 omega 7 and Sigma omega 3/Sigma omega 6 indicated that carnivory was the dominant feeding mode in the north, whereas herbivory was more prevalent in the south, a pattern that was not detected in the same region using stable isotope ratios. Such conflicting results substantiate the importance of utilizing more than one method to investigate feeding relationships in aquatic systems. Fatty acid profiles of the amphipod Themisto gaudichaudii revealed some distinct herbivory markers, indicating more complex feeding habits by this important pelagic species than previously reported. My findings shed new light on the regional variations in zooplankton diet and food web dynamics in a poorly understood but critically important frontal zone bordering the Southern Ocean.

J	Hader, DP; Villafane, VE; Helbling, EW				Haeder, Donat-P.; Villafane, Virginia E.; Helbling, E. Walter			Productivity of aquatic primary producers under global climate change	PHOTOCHEMICAL & PHOTOBIOLOGICAL SCIENCES												The productivity of aquatic primary producers depends on a number of biotic and abiotic factors, such as pH, CO2 concentration, temperature, nutrient availability, solar UV and PAR irradiances, mixing frequency as well as herbivore pressure and the presence of viruses, among others. The effects of these factors, within a climate change context, may be additive, synergistic or antagonistic. Since some of them, e.g. solar radiation and temperature, vary along a latitudinal gradient, this perspective about the effects of global climate change on primary producers will consider ecosystems individually, separated into polar (Arctic and Antarctic), temperate and tropical waters. As coastal waters are characterized by lower light penetration and higher DOM and nutrient concentrations, they are considered in a separate section. Freshwater systems are also governed by different conditions and therefore also treated in their own section. Overall, we show that although there are general common trends of changes in variables associated with global change (e.g. the impact of UVR on photosynthesis tends to decrease with increasing temperature and nutrient input), the responses of aquatic primary producers have great variability in the different ecosystems across latitudes. This is mainly due to direct or indirect effects associated with physico-chemical changes that occur within water bodies. Therefore we stress the need for regional predictions on the responses of primary producers to climate change as it is not warranted to extrapolate from one system to another.					Helbling, E.

Using the Autosub AUV as an example, several design issues affecting reliability are discussed, followed by an analysis of recorded faults. Perhaps contrary to expectations, failures rarely involved the autonomous nature of the vehicle. Rather, faults were typical of those that occur with any complex item of marine electromechanical equipment. Reliability under various operating conditions was assessed using Weibull parametric models. This reliability modelling was extended to the case of a vehicle operating under ice in order to estimate the probability of loss in situations where the support vessel could not gain access to a malfunctioning vehicle.

J	Smetacek, V; Nicol, S				Smetacek, V; Nicol, S			Polar ocean ecosystems in a changing world	NATURE												Polar organisms have adapted their seasonal cycles to the dynamic interface between ice and water. This interface ranges from the micrometre-sized brine channels within sea ice to the planetary-scale advance and retreat of sea ice. Polar marine ecosystems are particularly sensitive to climate change because small temperature differences can have large effects on the extent and thickness of sea ice. Little is known about the interactions between large, long-lived organisms and their planktonic food supply. Disentangling the effects of human exploitation of upper trophic levels from basin-wide, decade-scale climate cycles to identify long-term, global trends is a daunting challenge facing polar bio-oceanography.																	0028-0836	1476-4687				SEP 15	2005	437	7057					362	368		10.1038/nature04161							WOS:000231849100043	16163347					
J	Forcada, J; Trathan, PN				Forcada, Jaume; Trathan, Philip N.			Penguin responses to climate change in the Southern Ocean	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY												Penguins are adapted to live in extreme environments, but they can be highly sensitive to climate change, which disrupts penguin life history strategies when it alters the weather, oceanography and critical habitats. For example, in the southwest Atlantic, the distributional range of the ice-obligate emperor and AdElie penguins has shifted poleward and contracted, while the ice-intolerant gentoo and chinstrap penguins have expanded their range southward. In the Southern Ocean, the El Nino-Southern Oscillation and the Southern Annular Mode are the main modes of climate variability that drive changes in the marine ecosystem, ultimately affecting penguins. The interaction between these modes is complex and changes over time, so that penguin responses to climate change are expected to vary accordingly, complicating our understanding of their future population processes. Penguins have long life spans, which slow microevolution, and which is unlikely to increase their tolerance to rapid warming. Therefore, in order that penguins may continue to exploit their transformed ecological niche and maintain their current distributional ranges, they must possess adequate phenotypic plasticity. However, past species-specific adaptations also constrain potential changes in phenology, and are unlikely to be adaptive for altered climatic conditions. Thus, the paleoecological record suggests that penguins are more likely to respond by dispersal rather than adaptation. Ecosystem changes are potentially most important at the borders of current geographic distributions, where penguins operate at the limits of their tolerance; species with low adaptability, particularly the ice-obligates, may therefore be more affected by their need to disperse in response to climate and may struggle to colonize new habitats. While future sea-ice contraction around Antarctica is likely to continue affecting the ice-obligate penguins, understanding the responses of the ice-intolerant penguins also depends on changes in climate mode periodicities and interactions, which to date remain difficult to reproduce in general circulation models.																	1354-1013	1365-2486				JUL	2009	15	7					1618	1630		10.1111/j.1365-2486.2009.01909.x							WOS:000266700000002

In 1994-1995, the study area was characterized by fast-ice persistency throughout season and by higher pack ice concentration than the following year, when fast-ice retreated earlier. Both females' and males' behaviour were examined, and we then compared diving characteristic between years and between guard and crSche stages of chick rearing. We found that changes in fast-ice extent influenced the transit times between colony and foraging grounds and that females conducted longer foraging trips, dived for longer periods and made more dives than males. The diving parameters were affected neither by the sex nor by the year, but differed between the breeding stages. Parents guarding chicks had longer dive and bottom phase durations than in crSche (dive duration: guard = 48 s, crSche = 42 s; bottom duration: guard = 34 s, crSche = 26 s), whilst they had shorter recovery times (e.g. post dive duration) (guard = 29 s, crSche = 32 s). Possible causes for the observed differences in diving behaviours are discussed.

These include the congeneric Adelie, chinstrap and gentoo penguins, which now demonstrate remarkable population responses to regional warming. However, inconsistencies in the direction of population changes between species at different study sites complicate the understanding of causal processes. Here, we show that at the South Orkney Islands where the three species breed sympatrically, the less ice-adapted gentoo penguins increased significantly in numbers over the last 26 years, whereas chinstrap and Adelie penguins both declined. These trends occurred in parallel with regional long-term warming and significant reduction in sea ice extent. Periodical warm events, with teleconnections to the tropical Pacific, caused cycles in sea ice leading to reduced prey biomass, and simultaneous interannual population decreases in the three penguin species. With the loss of sea ice, Adelie penguins were less buffered against the environment, their numbers fluctuated greatly and their population response was strong and linear. Chinstrap penguins, considered to be better adapted to ice-free conditions, were affected by discrete events of locally increased ice cover, but showed less variable, nonlinear responses to sea ice loss. Gentoo penguins were temporarily affected by negative anomalies in regional sea ice, but persistent sea ice reductions were likely to increase their available niche, which is likely to be substantially segregated from that of their more abundant congeners. Thus, the regional consequences of global climate perturbations on the sea ice phenology affect the marine ecosystem, with repercussions for penguin food supply and competition for resources. Ultimately, variability in penguin populations with warming reflects the local balance between penguin adaptation to ice conditions and trophic-mediated changes cascading from global climate forcing.																	1354-1013	1365-2486				MAR	2006	12	3					411	423		10.1111/j.1365-2486.2006.01108.x							WOS:000236023000001						
J	Phleger, CF; Nichols, PD; Virtue, P				Phleger, CF; Nichols, PD; Virtue, P			Lipids and buoyancy in southern ocean pteropods	LIPIDS												The lipids of Clione limacina, a Southern Ocean pteropod (order Gymnosomata), contain 28% diacylglyceryl ether (DAGE) (as percentage of total lipid) whereas the pteropod Limacina helicina (order Thecosomata) lacks DAGE. The alkyl glyceryl ether diols (1-O-alkyl glycerols, GE) of Clione DAGE are dominated by 16:0 (60%) and 15:0 (21%), in contrast with deep-sea shark liver DAGE, which is dominated by 18:1 GE. The fatty acid profiles of Clione and Limacina are similar (28-32% polyunsaturated, 26-34% monounsaturated) as are the sterols, which include 24-methylenecholesterol, transdehydrocholesterol, cholesterol, and desmosterol. This finding probably reflects the fact that Limacina is the major food source for Clione. Spongiobranchaea australis, another Southern Ocean pteropod (order Gymnosomata), has 0.9-1.7% DAGE, but has less lipid (3.3-4.8 mg/g lipid, wet weight) than Clione (50.8 mg/g lipid, wet weight). We propose a buoyancy role for DAGE in Clione since Limacina has bubbles for flotation which Clione lack; DAGE provides 23% more uplift than triacylglycerol at a concentration of 1.025 g/mL seawater.

J	Barlow, KE; Croxall, JP				Barlow, KE; Croxall, JP			Provisioning behaviour of Macaroni Penguins Eudyptes chrysolophus	IBIS												Understanding how parental expenditure reflects food availability and influences reproductive output is a key part of studies of breeding performance. Provisioning behaviour is an important aspect of parental expenditure. We show that Macaroni Penguins Eudyptes chrysolophus have clear sex-specific differences in provisioning behaviour. Females provision chicks throughout rearing and at higher rates than males, which only participate in the later stages. Female provisioning is consistent throughout chick-rearing and appears to relate to a threshold rate governing whether or not chicks survive. The additional expenditure by males (but not females) during the creche period influenced chick growth and fledging mass of survivors. We suggest a very simple model to account for these sex-specific differences and effects. Interannual variation in parental expenditure resulted in differences in reproductive output between years. Years of lowest expenditure resulted in lowest growth rate of chicks, Sex-specific differences in provisioning were similar among years, however, with a consistent proportion of expenditure by males.																	0019-1019					APR	2002	144	2					248	258		10.1046/j.1474-919X.2002.00046.x							WOS:000175064100008

To improve understanding and characterization of coastal dynamics, there has been significant effort devoted to the development of autonomous systems that sample the ocean on relevant scales. Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) are especially well suited for studies of the coastal ocean because they are able to provide near-synoptic spatial observations. These sampling platforms are beginning to transition from the engineering groups that developed and continue to improve them to the science user. With this transition comes novel applications of these vehicles to address new questions in coastal oceanography. Here, the relatively mature Remote Environmental Monitoring Units (REMUS) AUV system is described and assessed. Analysis of data, based on 37 missions and nearly 800 km of in-water operation, shows that the vehicle's navigational error estimates were consistently less than 10 m, and error estimates of mission duration, distance, velocity, and power usage, once the vehicle was properly ballasted, were below 10%. An example of the transition to science is demonstrated in an experiment conducted in 2002 in Monterey Bay, California, where the vehicle was used to quantify critical horizontal length scales of variability. Length scales on the order of tens to hundreds of meters were found for the region within 25 km of the coastline, which has significant implications for designing proper sampling approaches and parameterizing model domains.

In this study, we investigated the Pb2+-induced inhibition and aggregation of Euphausia superba arginine kinase (ESAK) and found that significantly inactivated ESAK in a dose-dependent manner (IC50 = 0.058 +/- 0.002 mM). Spectrofluorimetry results showed that Pb2+ induced tertiary structural changes via the internal polarity increased and the non-polarity decreased in ESAK and directly induced ESAK aggregation. The ESAK aggregation process induced by Pb2+ occurred with multi-phase kinetics. The addition of osmolytes did not show protective effect on Pb2+-induced inactivation of ESAK. The computational molecular dynamics (MD) simulation showed that three Pb2+ interrupt the entrance of the active site of ESAK and it could be the reason on the loss of activity of ESAK. Several important residues of ESAK were detected that were importantly contributed the conformation and catalytic function of ESAK. Our study showed that Pb2+-induced misfolding of ESAK and the complete loss of activity irreversibly, which cannot be recovered by osmolytes. Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

J	Zotos, A; Taylor, KDA				Zotos, A; Taylor, KDA			Partial purification and characterization of proteases from Norway lobster (Nephrops norvegicus) and their role in the phenolase activation process	FOOD CHEMISTRY												Proteolytic activity in Norway lobster (Nephrops norvegicus) was studied. An improved separation and partial purification of the three proteases (designated as proteases I, II and III) was achieved from Norway lobster heads by a combination of acetone precipitation and DEAE-Sepharose CL-6B column chromatography. The purification achieved was 63-, 25- and 217-fold at pH 8.2, and 40-, 25- and 160-fold at pH 6.4 for protease I, II and III, respectively. With casein as substrate, protease III was most active at pH 8.2, whilst proteases I and II showed activity over a wide range of pH. Protease III was characterized as an alkaline Zn-serine protease as it was strongly inhibited by PMSF, soybean trypsin inhibitor, Co2+, Mn2+ and 1-10 phenanthroline. Protease I was strongly inhibited by p-benzoquinone, iodoacetamide, heavy metals (Ag+, Cu2+) and 1-10 phenanthroline and was thus characterized as a Zn-thiol protease. Protease II was also inhibited by the same inhibitors as protease I (but to a lesser extent) and was characterized as a thiol protease. The molecular weights were determined to be 22.5, 45 and 42.5 kDa (with activity at 18 kDa) for proteases I, II and III, respectively. It was found that protease III activates phenolase at pH 8.2, whilst proteases II and I can activate phenolase at both pH 6.7 and 8.2.

Optical delineation of benthic habitat using an autonomous underwater vehicle	JOURNAL OF FIELD ROBOTICS												To better characterize and improve our understanding of coastal waters, there has been an increasing emphasis on autonomous systems that can sample the ocean on relevant scales. Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) with active propulsion are especially well suited for studies of the coastal ocean because they are able to provide systematic and near-synoptic spatial observations. With this capability, science users are beginning to integrate sensor suits for a broad range of specific and often novel applications. Here, the relatively mature Remote Environmental Monitoring Units (REMUS) AUV system is configured with multi-spectral radiometers to delineate benthic habitat in Sequim Bay, WA. The vehicle was deployed in a grid pattern along 5 km of coastline in depths from 30 to less than 2 m. Similar to satellite and/or aerial remote sensing, the bandwidth ratios from the downward looking radiance sensor and upward looking irradiance sensor were used to identify beds of eelgrass on submeter scales. Strong correlations were found between the optical reflectance signals and the geo-referenced in situ data collected with underwater video within the grid. Results demonstrate the ability of AUVs to map littoral habitats at high resolution and highlight the overall utility of the REMUS vehicle for nearshore oceanography.

The primary assumption in estimating age from FAPs is that there is a linear (or at least monotonic) increase in FAP content with time. We have tested this assumption with the trochid gastropod Monodonta lineata, a species whose age can be established unequivocally from shell growth checks. Samples of 10 age classes (1.5-10.5 yr) were obtained and FAPs extracted from lyophilised cerebral ganglia and digestive gland. The fluorescence emission spectra were similar to those reported for other organisms, though the wavelength of maximum intensity varied with tissue, sex and age. Cerebral ganglia often showed two major emission peaks, digestive gland only one. Thin-layer chromatography indicated that at least three fluorescent compounds were present in the extracts. Digestive gland total FAP content did not vary for the first 5 yr of growth, but then trebled during the next 5 yr. The tissue concentration of FAP showed no statistically significant trend. Cerebral ganglia total FAP content increased during the first 5 yr then remained constant for the next 3 yr before declining. There was a steady decline in the concentration of cerebral ganglio FAP throughout life. These patterns indicate a complex relationship between FAP content and calendar age, and indicate that (at least in Monodonta) FAPs have little practical value for determining age.																	0022-0981						1990	144	2-3					185	204		10.1016/0022-0981(90)90028-B							WOS:A1990EP49800008

One solution is to integrate data without any threshold and then remove background noise during post-processing. Unthresholded, integrated data of micronekton and Euphausia superba collected with a SIMRAD EK500 at frequencies of 38 and 120 kHz are presented. The underlying background noise level follows a 20 log R + 2 alpha R relationship, which can be scaled to the minimum volume backscatter (Sv) in each layer during a transect and then subtracted from the entire data set to remove background noise. The utility of this procedure is demonstrated by making comparisons of Sv at each frequency and investigating the effect of noise removal on the identification of targets based on the dB difference (120 kHz Sv-38 kHz Sv).

J	McGehee, D; Jaffe, JS				McGehee, D; Jaffe, JS			Three-dimensional swimming behavior of individual zooplankters: Observations using the acoustical imaging system FishTV	ICES JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE					ICES International Symposium on Fisheries and Plankton Acoustics	JUN 12-16, 1995	MARINE LAB, ABERDEEN, SCOTLAND	Int Council Explorat Sea, Inst Acoust, Acoust Soc Amer, Soc Francaise Acoust	MARINE LAB			There is increasing recognition that three-dimensional tracks of individual zooplankters are needed for studies in biological oceanography, including, for example, the role of individual behavior in patch formation and maintenance. The three-dimensional acoustical imaging system FishTV provides a means of non-invasively examining zooplankton swimming behavior. The system forms a set of 64 acoustic beams in an 8 by 8 pattern, each beam 2 degrees by 2 degrees, for a total coverage of 16 degrees by 16 degrees. The 8 by 8 beams form two dimensions of the image; range provides the third dimension. The system has 20 kHz of bandwidth and operates at a center frequency of 445 kHz. Observations of zooplankton swimming at 37 m depth were made from the research platform RP ''FLIP'' at a site in the San Diego Trough, 28 km south-west of San Diego, California, USA. In a 1-min-long sequence of 60 images, acquired al 2101 h, 24 March 1993, 314 plankters were tracked for lengths of time ranging from 2 to 13 s. The animals ranged from -83.0 dB re l m(2) to -57.7 dB target strength. Movement of each animal was divided into directed and random components. The directed component was attributed to currents, waves and (possibly) a slight vertical migration. The random component was attributed to random behavior. Analysis of random velocities and turning behavior showed an inverse relationship between swimming speed and path curvature. Turning rates were approximately 1.2 rad s(-1) regardless of the size or speed of the animals. Mean swimming speeds were positively correlated with distance from a pair of bright lights (part of a video system), while mean path curvatures were negatively correlated. These observations are consistent with a model for swimming behavior that leads to aggregation.

Classification of live, untethered zooplankton from observations of multiple-angle acoustic scatter	JOURNAL OF THE ACOUSTICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA												A broadband, multiple-angle acoustic array was used to classify millimeter to centimeter sized live zooplankton in a laboratory tank. Reflections in the frequency range from 1.5 to 2.5 MHz were recorded from untethered 1-4 mm calanoid copepods and 8-12 mm mysids over an angular range of 0 degrees-47 degrees. A synchronized, coregistered video system recorded animal location and orientation. To highlight differences between animals, a frequency correlation matrix was computed from the observed wide-band power spectra of the scattered sound. Significant differences in the slopes and shapes of the eigenvalue spectra of this matrix were found for mysids versus copepods. These results support the idea that broadband, multiple-angle scatter can be used to classify organisms of different sizes and shapes.

J	Kawall, HG; Torres, JJ; Geiger, SP				Kawall, HG; Torres, JJ; Geiger, SP			Effects of the ice-edge bloom and season on the metabolism of copepods in the Weddell Sea, Antarctica	HYDROBIOLOGIA												The metabolic responses of several species of Antarctic copepods to primary productivity and changes between seasons were investigated. To examine the influence of the spring ice-edge bloom on the metabolism of copepods, oxygen consumption rates were determined on specimens from three zones of widely different ice coverage and chlorophyll biomass: pack ice (pre-bloom), ice edge (bloom) and open water (post-bloom). Summer metabolic rates were compared with published winter rates. Field work was done in the Weddell Sea in the region of 60 degreesS, 36 degreesW in late November and December 1993. Oxygen consumption rates were determined by placing individuals in syringe respirometers and monitoring the oxygen partial pressure for 10-20 hours. Higher metabolic rates were observed in the primarily herbivorous copepods, Calanoides acutus, Rhincalanus gigas and Calanus propinquus in regions of higher primary production: ice edge and open water. The carnivorous Paraeuchaeta antarctica showed a similar pattern. The omnivorous copepods Metridia gerlachei and Gaetanus tenuispinus showed no changes in metabolism between zones. Data on routine rates of copepods from the winter were available for C. propinquus and P. antarctica. In P. antarctica, rates were higher in the summer. Calanus propinquus showed a higher metabolic rate in the summer than in the winter, but the difference was not significant at the 0.05 level. It was concluded that copepods near the ice zone in the ice zone in the Antarctic rely on the spring ice-edge bloom for growth and completion of their life cycle.																	0018-8158						2001	453	1-3					67	77		10.1023/A:1013155614953							WOS:000172600200006						
J	Stanton, TK; Reeder, DB; Jech, JM				Stanton, TK; Reeder, DB; Jech, JM			Inferring fish orientation from broadband-acoustic echoes	ICES JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE					ICES Symposium on Acoustics in Fisheries and Aquatic Ecology	JUN 10-14, 2002	MONTPELLIER, FRANCE	ICES, Inst Rech Dev, IFREMER, Acoust Soc Amer, UK Inst Acoust, US Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Soc Francaise Acoust				A new method has been developed for inferring the orientation of fish through the use of broadband-acoustic signals. The method takes advantage of the high range resolution of these signals, once temporally compressed through cross-correlation. The temporal resolution of these compressed signals is inversely proportional to the bandwidth, thus the greater the bandwidth the higher the resolution. This process has been applied to broadband-chirp signals spanning the frequency range 40-95 kHz to obtain a range resolution of approximately 2 cm from the original, unprocessed resolution of about 50 cm. With such high resolution, individual scattering features along the fish have been resolved, especially for angles well off normal incidence. The overall duration of the compressed echo from live, individual alewife, as measured in a laboratory tank, is shown to increase monotonically with orientation angle relative to normal incidence. The increase is due to the greater range separation relative to the transducer between the echoes from the head and tail of the fish. The results of this study show that with a priori knowledge of the length of the fish, the orientation could be estimated from the duration of a single, compressed broadband echo. This method applies to individual, acoustically resolved fish. It has advantages over previous approaches because it derives the orientation from a single ping and it does not use a formal, mathematical scattering model. Design parameters for applications in the ocean are given for a range of conditions and fish size. (C) 2003 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

J	Reid, TA; Hindell, MA				Reid, TA; Hindell, MA			Coarse-scale relationships between seabirds and zooplankton off south-eastern Tasmania	MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH												Observations were made of seabird and zooplankton distribution in the waters adjacent to south-eastern Tasmania to examine correspondence at coarse scales (tens of kilometres). The distribution of seabirds was related mainly to changes in the water depth (and distance from land) over the length of the transect, whereas the distribution of zooplankton related to temporal changes. Significantly different associations of seabird species occurred in Storm Bay (mainly species breeding within the bay), and over the shelf-edge (with many non-breeding species dominant). Zooplankton diversity varied during the study, being greatest at the beginning (May) and end (September) of the study. Little correspondence was found between the distribution of seabirds and zooplankton at the community level, but there were significant relationships for several species, such as diving petrels and gannets. The lack of an overall correspondence between seabirds and zooplankton may have been due to the patchiness of seabird and zooplankton distribution, limits to the requirements of seabirds to find maximum prey densities (instead only needing to find 'enough'), the lack of certainty about whether seabirds were foraging when observed, and behavioural interactions among seabirds.

J	Hamame, M; Antezana, T				Hamame, Madeleine; Antezana, Tarsicio			Vertical diel migration and feeding of Euphausia vallentini within southern Chilean fjords	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY												E. vallentini is a circumpolar vertical migrator in the open ocean that enters the Chilean fjords through the sills to become the most common and abundant euphausiid. The diel migratory and feeding patterns of this species are studied in this distinct, enclosed and bathymetrically variable environment. The main goal was to determine the ability of E. vallentini to alter its vertical diel range in order to avoid shallow depths, or to maintain its depth migratory range and take advantage of benthic environment during daytime. Multiple opening closing nets sampled the water column in several basins along the Strait of Magellan. Fluorometrically determined stomach pigments along with on board experiments of evacuation rates allowed estimation of ingestion and consumption rates. Samples of stomach content were microscopically examined to compare day and night diet. E. vallentini migrated between the surface at night and 100-200 m in daytime. Surface night dwellers had higher chlorophyll stomach content than deep daytime dwellers. Diet composition changed from dinoflagellates and tintinnids at night, to a polychaeths-dominated diet in daytime. Stomach content, ingestion rates and consumption rates of phytoplankton were higher at night than in daytime, and accounted for an impact of 0.17% upon phytoplankton biomass. Changes of diet of E. vallentini imply unique adaptations to take advantage of both pelagic and demersal environments, which could explain its high abundance and high frequency of encounter within the southern Chilean fjords.

Drivers of intrapopulation variation in resource use in a generalist predator, the macaroni penguin	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												Intrapopulation variation in resource use occurs in many populations of generalist predators with important community and evolutionary implications. One of the hypothesised mechanisms for such widespread variation is ecological opportunity, i.e. resource availability determined by intrinsic constraints and extrinsic conditions. In this study, we combined tracking data and stable isotope analysis to examine how breeding constraints and prey conditions influenced intrapopulation variation in resource use in a generalist predator, the macaroni penguin Eudyptes chrysolophus. Isotopic variation was also examined as a function of breeding success, individual traits and individual specialisation. Variation in isotope ratios was greatest across multiple tissue types when birds were able to undertake mid-range foraging trips (i.e. during incubation and pre-moult). This variation was highly consistent between years that spanned a 3-fold difference in local prey Euphausia superba density, and was also highly consistent at the individual level between 2 years that had similar prey densities. Furthermore, by comparing our results with previous work on the same population, it appeared that a decrease in local prey availability can also increase intrapopulation variation in resource use during periods with more restricted foraging ranges (i.e. during brood-guard and creche). This study highlights the importance of considering ecological interactions that operate on multiple spatio-temporal scales when examining the drivers of resource use in populations of generalist predators.

Seasonal trophic structure of the Scotia Sea pelagic ecosystem considered through biomass spectra and stable isotope analysis	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY												The biomass size structure of pelagic communities provides a system level perspective that can be instructive when considering trophic interactions. Such perspectives can become even more powerful when combined with taxonomic information and stable isotope analysis. Here we apply these approaches to the pelagic community of the Scotia Sea (Southern Ocean) and consider the structure and development of trophic interactions over different years and seasons. Samples were collected from three open-ocean cruises during the austral spring 2006, summer 2008 and autumn 2009. Three main sampling techniques were employed: sampling bottles for microplankton (0-50 m), vertically hauled fine meshed nets for mesozooplankton (0-400 m) and coarse-meshed trawls for macrozooplankton and nekton (0-1000 m). All samples were identified to the lowest practicable taxonomic level and their abundance, individual body weight and biomass (in terms of carbon) estimated. Slopes of normalised biomass spectrum versus size showed a significant but not substantial difference between cruises and were between -1.09 and -1.06. These slopes were shallower than expected for a community at equilibrium and indicated that there was an accumulation of biomass in the larger size classes (10(1)-10(5) mg C ind(-1)). A secondary structure of biomass domes was also apparent, with the domes being 2.5-3 log(10) intervals apart in spring and summer and 2 log(10) intervals apart in autumn. The recruitment of copepod-consuming macrozooplankton, Euphausia triacantha and Themisto gaudichaudii into an additional biomass dome was responsible for the decrease in the inter-dome interval in autumn. Predator to prey mass ratios estimated from stable isotope analysis reached a minimum in autumn while the estimated trophic level of myctophid fish was highest in that season. This reflected greater amounts of internal recycling and increased numbers of trophic levels in autumn compared to earlier times of the year. The accumulation of biomass in larger size classes throughout the year in the Scotia Sea may reflect the prevalence of species that store energy and have multiyear life-cycles. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Three proteases were separated and partially purified from Norway lobster heads by a combination of acetone precipitation and DEAE-Sepharose CL-6B column chromatography and designated as enzymes I, II and III. Enzyme III had a pH optimum at around 8.2 towards casein as substrate. Enzymes I and II were found to be very similar in most aspects; they showed multiple pH optima towards casein. Studies on sensitivity to different inhibitors suggested that enzymes I and II were likely to be thiol proteases and enzyme III a metal-dependent serine protease. It was found that only enzyme III was involved in the phenolase activation process in Norway lobster.																	0308-8146						1992	45	2					111	116		10.1016/0308-8146(92)90019-X							WOS:A1992JD84600007

Physical Drivers of Phytoplankton Bloom Initiation in the Southern Ocean's Scotia Sea	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS												The Scotia Sea is the site of one of the largest spring phytoplankton blooms in the Southern Ocean. Past studies suggest that shelf-iron inputs are responsible for the high productivity in this region, but the physical mechanisms that initiate and sustain the bloom are not well understood. Analysis of profiling float data from 2002 to 2017 shows that the Scotia Sea has an unusually shallow mixed-layer depth during the transition from winter to spring, allowing the region to support a bloom earlier in the season than elsewhere in the Antarctic Circumpolar Current. We compare these results to the mixed-layer depth in the 1/6 degrees data-assimilating Southern Ocean State Estimate and then use the model output to assess the physical balances governing mixed-layer variability in the region. Results indicate the importance of lateral advection of Weddell Sea surface waters in setting the stratification. A Lagrangian particle release experiment run backward in time suggests that Weddell outflow constitutes 10% of the waters in the upper 200 m of the water column in the bloom region. This dense Weddell water subducts below the surface waters in the Scotia Sea, establishing a sharp subsurface density contrast that cannot be overcome by wintertime convection. Profiling float trajectories are consistent with the formation of Taylor columns over the region's complex bathymetry, which may also contribute to the unique stratification. Furthermore, biogeochemical measurements from 2016 and 2017 bloom events suggest that vertical exchange associated with this Taylor column enhances productivity by delivering nutrients to the euphotic zone. Plain Language Summary Tiny algae called phytoplankton form the base of the marine food web and absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere through photosynthesis. Therefore, understanding the processes that control the location and timing of phytoplankton blooms is necessary to accurately model marine ecosystems and the global carbon cycle. In this study, we examine the upper ocean conditions that support the earliest and largest offshore spring phytoplankton bloom in the Southern Ocean, which surrounds Antarctica and is a key region of carbon uptake for the global ocean. Observational data and model output both suggest that the bloom region has unique stratification, which is conducive to bloom development. By releasing virtual particles into a climate model and tracking their position, we find that currents transport cold water to the bloom site from the Weddell Sea. This cold water is key to explaining the region's unusual stratification. Finally, we analyze new observations taken by robotic floats of the 2016 and 2017 blooms. These data suggest that biological productivity is closely linked to the seafloor topography. This is because flow over topography leads to enhanced mixing, which delivers essential nutrients to the sunlit upper ocean where phytoplankton can grow.

The purified enzyme determined to be homogeneous by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis ( PAGE) and SDS-PAGE. The specific activity of the purified enzyme was 1,560 U mg(-1). Enzyme molecular weight was determined to be 105,000 Da; it contained two subunits of the same mass ( 45,000 Da). The pI value was calculated to be 4.8 by isoelectric focusing. The optimum pH and optimum temperature of the enzyme for the hydrolysis of pNP-beta-D-GlcNAc ( enzyme substrate) were determined to be pH 5.2 and 45 degreesC, respectively. The behavior of the enzyme during hydrolysis of pNP-beta-D-GlcNAc followed Michaelis - Menten kinetics, with K-m = 0.254 mM and V-m = 9.438 muM min(-1), at pH 5.2 and 37 degreesC. The stability of the enzyme was investigated, and the results showed that the enzyme was stable in a pH range from 4.2 to 10.0 and at temperatures < 40 degrees C. The effects of metal ions on the enzyme were also studied. Li+, Na+ and K+ had no influence on enzyme activity. Mg2+, Ca2+ and Mn2+ activated the enzyme, while Ba2+, Zn2+, Co2+, Cd2+, Hg2+, Pb2+ Cu2+, Fe3+ and Al3+ showed various degrees of inhibitory effects on the enzyme.

Frank			Discovery of a ciliate parasitoid of euphausiids off Oregon, USA: Collinia oregonensis n. sp (Apostomatida : Colliniidae)	DISEASES OF AQUATIC ORGANISMS												An apostome ciliate, Collinia oregonensis n. sp., is reported inhabiting the cephalothorax and abdomen of 3 euphausiid species from the Oregon-Washington coast: Euphausia pacifica Hansen, 1911, Thysanoessa spinifera Holmes, 1900, and Thysanoessa gregaria G.O. Sars, 1883. This ciliate is the 7th species described for the genus Collinia and the 2nd species known to infect euphausiids. Disease progression and ciliate morphology are described using (1) modified protargol stain, (2) hematoxylin counterstained with Fast Green, and (3) Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). All endoparasitic developmental stages (trophont, tomont, tomitogenesis, protomite, and tomite) of C. oregonensis are astomatous and possess between 14 and 22 kineties. C. oregonensis is smaller than C. beringensis Capriulo & Small, 1986, which infects the euphausiid Thysanoessa inermis Kroyer, 1846 in the Bering Sea and which possesses between 24 and 80 kineties. The ciliate is a parasitoid because it must kill the host to complete its life cycle. Infections and mortalities in multiple host species likely reflect the virulent nature of the ciliate. Adult euphausiids infected with this parasitoid possess a swollen and bright orange cephalothorax. C. oregonensis feeds and proliferates inside euphausiids, producing fulminating infections that rupture the cephalothorax and release large numbers of tomites into the surrounding water. After several hours in the free swimming stage under shipboard conditions in the present study, the tomites adhered to each other, forming filaments. Infection rates ranged between 3 and 20% within individual euphausiid aggregations, but infected aggregations were randomly and sparingly distributed. Infected euphausiids were found at 6.7% of 316 stations sampled during 3 summer cruises. No infected euphausiids were collected in winter. Because E. pacifica and T spinifera account for about 90% of the euphausiid standing stock in the northern California Current System, this parasitoid ciliate may have a significant impact on euphausiid population abundance, distribution and secondary productivity.																	0177-5103	1616-1580				JUL 11	2006	71	1					33	49		10.3354/dao071033							WOS:000240510300005	16921999

This paper shows that it is necessary to verify mean volume backscattering strength (MVBS, dB) values acquired from each beam for quantitative analysis of the spatial distribution or the biomass estimates of such specific targets as SSL or a fish school when using an ADCP. In this study, the SSL was selected to be a homogeneous density layer over a large area and two methods were used to verify the MVBS values from each beam of the ADCP. First, a mutual comparison among four beams was conducted after calculating MVBS from the measured echo intensity. Second, the MVBS values were verified using comparison between the calculated MVBS from the 153.6 kHz ADCP and MVBS from three frequencies of a well-calibrated scientific echosounder. Moreover, the dominant scatterers (euphausiids) were collected by a framed midwater trawl. From these samples, biological data were used to identify the different frequency characteristics between two systems, using a distorted-wave Born approximation (DWBA) theoretical backscattering model in order to assess the averaged target strength and target strength TS differences for the three frequencies.

J	Horswill, C; Trathan, PN; Ratcliffe, N				Horswill, Cat; Trathan, Philip N.; Ratcliffe, Norman			Linking extreme interannual changes in prey availability to foraging behaviour and breeding investment in a marine predator, the macaroni penguin	PLOS ONE												Understanding the mechanisms that link prey availability to predator behaviour and population change is central to projecting how a species may respond to future environmental pressures. We documented the behavioural responses and breeding investment of macaroni penguins Eudyptes chrysolophus across five breeding seasons where local prey density changed by five-fold; from very low to highly abundant. When prey availability was low, foraging trips were significantly longer and extended overnight. Birds also foraged farther from the colony, potentially in order to reach more distant foraging grounds and allow for increased search times. These extended foraging trips were also linked to a marked decrease in fledgling weights, most likely associated with reduced rates of provisioning. Furthermore, by comparing our results with previous work on this population, it appears that lowered first-year survival rates associated, at least partially, with fledging masses were also evident for this cohort. This study integrates a unique set of prey density, predator behaviour and predator breeding investment data to highlight a possible behavioural mechanism linking perturbations in prey availability to population demography.

Distribution of known macrozooplankton abundance and biomass in the global ocean	EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE DATA												Macrozooplankton are an important link between higher and lower trophic levels in the oceans. They serve as the primary food for fish, reptiles, birds and mammals in some regions, and play a role in the export of carbon from the surface to the intermediate and deep ocean. Little, however, is known of their global distribution and biomass. Here we compiled a dataset of macrozooplankton abundance and biomass observations for the global ocean from a collection of four datasets. We harmonise the data to common units, calculate additional carbon biomass where possible, and bin the dataset in a global 1 x 1 degree grid. This dataset is part of a wider effort to provide a global picture of carbon biomass data for key plankton functional types, in particular to support the development of marine ecosystem models. Over 387 700 abundance data and 1330 carbon biomass data have been collected from pre-existing datasets. A further 34 938 abundance data were converted to carbon biomass data using species-specific length frequencies or using species-specific abundance to carbon biomass data. Depth-integrated values are used to calculate known epipelagic macrozooplankton biomass concentrations and global biomass. Global macrozooplankton biomass, to a depth of 350 m, has a mean of 8.4 mu g CL-1, median of 0.2 mu g CL-1 and a standard deviation of 63.5 mu g CL-1. The global annual average estimate of macrozooplankton biomass in the top 350 m, based on the median value, is 0.02 Pg C. There are, however, limitations on the dataset; abundance observations have good coverage except in the South Pacific mid-latitudes, but biomass observation coverage is only good at high latitudes. Biomass is restricted to data that is originally given in carbon or to data that can be converted from abundance to carbon. Carbon conversions from abundance are restricted by the lack of information on the size of the organism and/or the absence of taxonomic information. Distribution patterns of global macrozooplankton biomass and statistical information about biomass concentrations may be used to validate biogeochemical and plankton functional type models.

Local environment shapes adaptation of Phaeocystis antarctica to salinity perturbations: Evidence for physiological resilience	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY												The Southern Ocean (SO) is a fragile ecosystem as judged by changes in the timing of the advance and retreat of its ice cover. In the SO, the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) and the near shore gyres (Weddell Sea and Ross Sea) provide local environments with distinct temperature and salinity attributes associated with varying sea ice history. Phaeocystis antarctica is a prymnesiophyte often dominating polar phytoplankton blooms in the (SO) and is a keystone species there because its abundance can have negative effects on higher trophic levels and it can influence air/sea gas exchange involved in DMSP production, Thus, its ability to survive in response to perturbations in the environments may be linked to its genetic diversity within its populations as they move around the SO. Here we apply increased (70 PSU) and decreased (18 PSU) salinity treatments to five genetically different P. antarctica strains isolated from three different water masses to test whether genetic similarity or water mass physical features were more important in determining responses to salinity changes, such as those encountered by inclusion into sea ice brine channels and/or its subsequent melt water in those water masses that have annual ice cover. Strains that were geographically close (isolated from the same water mass), but genetically distinct (ca. 30% similar and from different gene pools as judged by microsatellite (MS) and amplified fragment linked polymorphisms (AFLP) analyses responded similarly to higher and lower salinity regimes, whereas genetically close strains (ca. 95% identical or from the same gene pool) that originated from different water masses and hence different environmental conditions responded differently. Dimethylsulphoniopropionate (DMSP) production in response to these salinity changes were not significantly different between any of the strains/treatments. Considering the presence of highly similar genotypes in ice-free as well as seasonally ice covered sampling sites, the observed phenotypic differences most likely result from rapid local adaptation between both habitat types or a hybridization of isolates from the two gene pools with the resultant genotype for salinity tolerance being that from which the isolate originated, suggesting that the selective effect of seasonal presence or year-round absence of sea ice overrides gene flow between these habitats to adapt the physiology of cells to the environment in a relatively short period of time.																	0022-0981	1879-1697				MAY	2021	538								151527	10.1016/j.jembe.2021.151527							WOS:000641001600003

The availability of oxygen within Tisler Reef, recorded between 2006 and 2008, showed a decline during the summer months, caused by both the isolation of the reef from the atmosphere under conditions of seasonal stratification, and the enhanced respiration in the water column during the seasonal zooplankton proliferations. Concentrations of dissolved oxygen were replenished from high-current flows advecting water from off the reef. Low current flow conditions (<0.05ms(-1)) coincided with a short-term reduction in oxygen, the extent of which varied seasonally and were observed to be greatest during July and August, coinciding with the summer Calanus proliferation in the Skagerrak. Normalized acoustic backscatter amplitude during the summer months showed a strong signal of zooplankton diurnal vertical migration, coinciding with the lowest oxygen concentrations at the reef observed during, and lagging slightly after, the deep phase of the zooplankton vertical migration. This effect was most obvious during low-flow conditions; highlighting the importance of zooplankton and associated activity as a consumer of oxygen at the reef.

We tested the hypothesis that N. simplex has a more diverse parasitic assemblage than N. difficilis because it is a neritic species, has larger population abundance, and tends to form denser and more compact swarms than N. difficilis. These biological and behavioral features may enhance parasite transmission within swarms, We detected 6 types of ectoparasites: (1) epibiotic diatoms Licmophora sp.; (2) Ephelotidae suctorian ciliates; (3) Foettingeriidae exuviotrophic apostome ciliates; (4) an unidentified epicaridean cryptoniscus larvae (isopoda); and 2 castrators: (5) the ectoparasitic Dajidae isopod Notophryxus lateralis and (6) the ellobiopsid mesoparasite Thalassomyces fagei. We also detected 7 types of endoparasites: (1) an undescribed Collinia ciliate (Apostomatida); 3 types of Cestoda: (2) a Tetrarhynchobothruium sp. (Trypanorhyncha), (3) Echinobothrium sp. (Diphyllidea: Echinobothyriidae), and (4) unidentified metacestode; (5) a Trematoda Paronatrema-like metacercaria (Syncoeliidae); (6) the nematode Anisakis simplex (L3); and (7) Polymorphidae acantocephalan larvae (acanthor, acanthella, and cystacanth larval stages). N. simplex is affected by all types of parasites, except the isopod N. lateralis, having a considerably larger parasitic diversity and prevalence rates than N. difficilis, which is only infested with 3 types of ectoparasites and T fagei. Euphausiid swarming is an adaptive behavior for reproduction, protection against predators, and increased efficiency in food searching, but has a negative effect Clue to parasitism. Although the advantages of aggregation must overcome the reduction of population and individual fitness induced by parasites, we demonstrated that all types of parasites can affect similar to 14%, of N. simplex individuals. Collinia spp. endoparasitoids must occasionally have a significant influence on population mortality with potential epizootic events.

Intra-patch clustering in mysid swarms revealed through multifrequency acoustics	ICES JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE												Simultaneous multifrequency acoustic echosounders (70, 120, 200, 333, and 710 kHz), net tows, and video sampling were conducted on dense mysid aggregations in coastal waters off OR, USA, to study intra-patch dynamics in mysid swarms. Multifrequency differencing techniques demonstrated submetre, intra-patch clustering of individual mysids of different frequency response characteristics in all 33 samples collected. For samples that contained multiple sizes of mysids, frequency response curves showed a consistent peak 200 kHz. Samples dominated by only a single size class of small (5 mm long mysids) had a peak in scattering at 710 kHz. Intra-patch clustering of heterogeneous individuals shown here demonstrates patchiness at the scales of interactions among individual mysids; however, this patchiness is likely averaged out at the scale of large predator-mysid swarm interactions or the scale typical of most scientific surveys.																	1054-3139	1095-9289				JUL	2013	70	4					883	891		10.1093/icesjms/fst034							WOS:000321057000017

A method for identifying Sound Scattering Layers and extracting key characteristics	METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION												Mid-trophic level water-column (pelagic) marine communities comprise millions of tonnes of zooplankton and micronekton that form dense and geographically extensive layers, known as sound scattering layers (SSLs) when observed acoustically. SSLs are ubiquitous in the global ocean, and individual layers can span entire ocean basins. Many SSLs exhibit clear diel vertical migration behaviour. Vertical migrations contribute substantially to the biological pump', such that SSLs have important global biogeochemical roles: SSLs are important conduits for vertical energy and nutrient flow. Ship-based remote sensing of SSLs using acoustic instruments (echosounders) enables their shape and density to be quantified, but despite SSLs being discovered in the 1940s, there is no consistent method for identifying or characterising SSLs. This hampers ecological and biogeographical studies of SSLs. We have developed an automated and reproducible method for SSL identification and characterisation, the sound scattering layer extraction method (SSLEM). It functions independently of echosounder frequency and the spatial scale (vertical and horizontal) of the data. Here we demonstrate the SSLEM through its application to identify SSLs in data gathered to a depth of 1000m using 38 kHz hull-mounted echosounders in the south-west Indian Ocean and Tasman Sea. SSLs were identified in the water column as horizontally extensive echoes that were above background noise. For each identified SSL, a set of 9 quantitative SSL metrics' (describing their shape, dynamics and acoustic backscattering distribution) were determined, enabling inferences to be made concerning the spatial arrangement, distribution and heterogeneity of the biological community. The method was validated by comparing its output to a set of visually derived SSL metrics that were evaluated independently by 8 students. The SSLEM outperformed the by-eye analysis, identifying three times the number of SSLs and with greater validity; 95% of SSLs identified by the SSLEM were deemed valid, compared to 75% by the students. In the same way that data obtained from satellites have enabled the study and characterisation of global phytoplankton distribution and production, we envisage that the SSLEM will facilitate robust, repeatable and quantitative analysis of the growing body of SSL observations arising from underway-acoustic observations, enhancing our understanding of global ocean function.

Age and growth of Brauer's lanternfish Gymnoscopelus braueri and rhombic lanternfish Krefftichthys anderssoni (Family Myctophidae) in the Scotia Sea, Southern Ocean	JOURNAL OF FISH BIOLOGY												This study examines age and growth of Brauer's lanternfish Gymnoscopelus braueri and rhombic lanternfish Krefftichthys anderssoni from the Scotia Sea in the Southern Ocean, through the analysis of annual growth increments deposited on sagittal otoliths. Otolith pairs from 177 G. braueri and 118 K. anderssoni were collected in different seasons from the region between 2004 and 2009. Otolith-edge analysis suggested a seasonal change in opaque and hyaline depositions, indicative of an annual growth pattern, although variation within the populations of both species was apparent. Age estimates varied from 1 to 6 years for G. braueri (40 to 139 mm standard length; L-S) and from 0 to 2 years for K. anderssoni (26 to 70 mm L-S). Length-at-age data were broadly consistent with population cohort parameters identified in concurrent length-frequency data from the region for both species. The estimated values of von Bertalanffy growth curves for G. braueri were L-infinity = 133.22 mm, k = 0.29 year(-1) and t(0) = -0.21 year and the values for K. anderssoni were L-infinity = 68.60 mm, k = 0.71 year(-1) and t(0) = -0.49 year. There were no significant (P > 0.05) differences in growth between sexes for either species, suggesting that males and females have similar growth and development trajectories in the Scotia Sea. A positive allometric relationship between L-S and wet mass was found for each species, as well as a significant (P < 0.0001) linear relationship between otolith size and L-S. Growth performance (CYRILLIC CAPITAL LETTER EF ') was similar between the two species and congruent with other myctophid species across the Southern Ocean. This study provides important parameters for future Southern Ocean ecosystem studies in a resource management context.

The added-concentration dependent effects of FPH (2.5-12.5%, dry weight/wet weight) on the state of water and denaturation of lizard fish myofibrils were evaluated by desorption isotherm curves, myofibrillar Ca-ATPase activity, and unfrozen water which was determined by differential scanning calorimetry during dehydration. The water activity (A(w)) in myofibrils was distinctly decreased with the increasing concentration of FPH from 2.5% up to 10.0%, although the A(w) added with 12.5% of FPH was almost equal to that with 10.0% of FPH. The amount of unfrozen water in myofibrils during dehydration was increased by the addition of FPH, and the greatest increase was found at 5.0-10.0%. The FPH suppressed the inactivation of myofibrillar Ca-ATPase activity during dehydration, and a larger effect of suppression was observed at 7.5% addition of FPH. These findings suggest that peptides produced in FPH functioned to stabilize the hydrate water surrounding the myofibrils and suppressed their dehydration-induced denaturation.

The kinetic parameters of pyrolysis reactions were obtained via the distributed activation energy model (DAEM). Experimental results showed that the temperature at which the highest weight loss rate occurred increased from 280 to 315 degrees C as the heating rate increased from 5 to 30 degrees C min(-1). Almost all the volatiles were evolved between 300 and 350 degrees C, while CH4 and aliphatic C-H were also produced at higher-temperature regions. A large amount of CO2 was generated above 650 degrees C by the decomposition of carbonates, and it can be further reduced to CO by ESW char. CO2 was the main non-condensable product, and ketones were the dominating condensable products. The activation energy of pyrolysis reactions increased from 79 to 392 kJ mol(-1) for conversion rates 0.13 to 0.54. The linear relationship between the natural logarithm of the frequency factor and activation energy was also established. The activation energy approximately followed Gaussian distribution, and the mean activation energy was 162 kJ mol(-1).																	2190-6815	2190-6823				JUN	2018	8	2					329	337		10.1007/s13399-017-0281-7							WOS:000432540300010

From the kinematic analysis, we determined that the moving thoracic exopodites were spatially segregated along two axes, which reduced the interference between the ipsilateral swimming appendages. The posterior thoracic exopodites, particularly the three posteriormost appendages, varied the orientation of their paths, thereby influencing the trajectory of the exhalent stream. The predominant trajectory of the paired exhalent streams was in a ventroposterior direction, but the exhalent streams could adopt more pronounced dorsal or ventral directions relative to those more commonly observed. The fact that only one exhalent stream emerged from each side of the animal suggested that the exopodites were propelling water in a synergistic fashion. Cannon and Manton (1927) claimed that the elliptical motion of the exopodites produced both swimming currents and feeding currents, the so-called "axial currents" that flow medially between adjacent basipodites, joining together with an anteriorly directed current between the eighth pair of endopodites in the food groove to transport food to the mouth. Although we presented fine streams of fluorescein dye to tethered animals, we never observed lateral feeding currents or food groove cur-rents. We concur with Depdolla (1923) and Attramadal (1981) that food enters the feeding basket only from the front.																	0278-0372					FEB	1992	12	1					1	10		10.2307/1548713							WOS:A1992HC68000001

Here a new method is presented, which uses a condition index based on dry weight to predict growth increments. The method is based on a simple equation relating dry weights of shrimp and exuvia directly after moult with length measurements before and after moult. The parameter estimation of the model requires controlled moult experiments in the laboratory. In total 272 individuals moulted successfully within the first 2 days after capture, hence the increments reflected the feeding situation of the prior feeding period in the field. The results confirmed the validity of the method with data from two different years and demonstrated that in C. crangon the model parameters differ significantly between the two sexes. As a side product also moult intervals were estimated as a function of length and temperature. Moult increments were relatively shorter and more variable than previously found.

This can constitute a substantial problem for robust stock assessment when 38-kHz data are compromised. Research vessels now typically collect multifrequency data during acoustic surveys, which could be used to remediate such situations. Here, we investigate the utility of using 18-and 120-kHz data for herring abundance estimation when the standard 38-kHz approach is not possible. Estimates of herring abundance/biomass in the Celtic Sea (2007-2010) were calculated at 18, 38, and 120 kHz using the standard 38-kHz target-strength (TS) model and geometrically equivalent TS models at 18 and 120 kHz. These estimates were compared to assess the level of coherence between the three frequencies, and 18-kHz-derived estimates were subsequently input into standard 38-kHz-based population models to evaluate the impact on the assessment. Results showed that estimates of herring abundance/ biomass from 18 and 38 kHz acoustic integration varied by only 0.3-5.4%, and acoustically derived numbers-at-age estimates were not significantly (p. 0.05) different from 1: 1. Estimates at 120 kHz were also robust. Furthermore, 18-kHz-derived estimates did not significantly change the assessment model output, indicating that 18-kHz data can be used for herring stock assessment purposes.

Until recently, many efforts to measure and monitor abundance of these species' groups have focussed on smaller populations and spatial scales, and efforts to account for perception bias and availability bias have been variable and often ad hoc. We describe a suite of new methods, technologies and estimation procedures for cost-effective, large-scale abundance estimation within a general estimation framework and illustrate their application on large Ad,lie penguin populations in two regions of East Antarctica. The methods include photographic sample counts, automated cameras for collecting availability data, and bootstrap estimation to adjust counts for the sampling fraction, perception bias, and availability bias, and are applicable for a range of land-breeding marine species. The methods will improve our ability to obtain population data over large spatial and population scales within tight logistic, environmental and time constraints. This first application of the methods has given new insights into the biases and uncertainties in abundance estimation for penguins and other land-breeding marine species. We provide guidelines for applying the methods in future surveys.

Fine-scale diet of the Australian sea lion (Neophoca cinerea) using DNA-based analysis of faeces	MARINE ECOLOGY-AN EVOLUTIONARY PERSPECTIVE												We applied DNA-based faecal analysis to determine the diet of female Australian sea lions (n=12) from two breeding colonies in South Australia. DNA dietary components of fish and cephalopods were amplified using the polymerase chain reaction and mitochondrial DNA primers targeting the short (similar to 100 base pair) section of the 16S gene region. Prey diversity was determined by sequencing similar to 50 amplicons generated from clone libraries developed for each individual. Faecal DNA was also combined and cloned from multiple individuals at each colony and fish diversity determined. Diets varied between individuals and sites. Overall, DNA analysis identified a broad diversity of prey comprising 23 fish and five cephalopod taxa, including many species not previously described as prey of the Australian sea lion. Labridae (wrasse), Monacanthidae (leatherjackets) and Mullidae (goat fish) were important fish prey taxa. Commonly identified cephalopods were Octopodidae (octopus), Loliginidae (calamary squid) and Sepiidae (cuttlefish). Comparisons of fish prey diversity determined by pooling faecal DNA from several samples provided a reasonable but incomplete resemblance (55-71%) to the total fish diversity identified across individual diets at each site. Interpretation of diet based on the recovery of prey hard-parts identified one cephalopod beak (Octopus sp.) and one fish otolith (Parapriacanthus elongatus). The present study highlights the value of DNA-based analyses and their capabilities to enhance information of trophic interactions.

The role of lipids during embryonic development of the euphausiids Euphausia pacifica and Thysanoessa spinifera	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												To understand the role of lipids during early embryogenesis, major lipid classes together with individual fatty-acid and sterol composition were determined in embryos from multiple developmental stages of the euphausiids Euphausia pacifica and Thysanoessa spinifera. Average lipid content in embryos of E. pacifica and T. spinifera from the earliest stage (multicell) were 4.45 and 3.69 mu g embryo(-1), respectively. During development, the lipid content decreased at similar rates in the embryos of both species. In contrast to many crustacean eggs, phospholipids were the dominant lipid class in all embryonic stages, with decreasing concentrations seen during development. Individual fatty acids and sterols showed selective utilization during early developmental stages. The dominant fatty acids were 16:0 and 16:1 omega 7 and 20:5 omega 3, with most polyunsaturated fatty acids preferentially metabolized throughout early stages. An exception was 22:6 omega 3, which remained near constant through all stages. Cholesterol was the dominant sterol (> 82% of total sterols) in embryos, with only minor changes during development. The appearance of algal sterols and fatty alcohols, including phytol, in T. spinifera embryos suggests that considerable amounts of algal lipids are directly allocated to eggs during vitellogenesis. Despite the substantial changes in lipid amount and composition during embryo development, the presence of phospholipids as the dominate lipid store acts to moderate changes in egg-sinking rate for both species until the late (early and late limb-bud) stages of development.

From siphonophores to deep scattering layers: uncertainty ranges for the estimation of global mesopelagic fish biomass	ICES JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE												The mesopelagic community is important for downward oceanic carbon transportation and is a potential food source for humans. Estimates of global mesopelagic fish biomass vary substantially (between 1 and 20 Gt). Here, we develop a global mesopelagic fish biomass model using daytime 38 kHz acoustic backscatter from deep scattering layers. Model backscatter arises predominantly from fish and siphonophores but the relative proportions of siphonophores and fish, and several of the parameters in the model, are uncertain. We use simulations to estimate biomass and the variance of biomass determined across three different scenarios; S1, where all fish have gas-filled swimbladders, and S2 and S3, where a proportion of fish do not. Our estimates of biomass ranged from 1.8 to 16 Gt (25-75% quartile ranges), and median values of S1 to S3 were 3.8, 4.6, and 8.3 Gt, respectively. A sensitivity analysis shows that for any given quantity of fish backscatter, the fish swimbladder volume, its size distribution and its aspect ratio are the parameters that cause most variation (i.e. lead to greatest uncertainty) in the biomass estimate. Determination of these parameters should be prioritized in future studies, as should determining the proportion of backscatter due to siphonophores.

Shrimp were concentrated in two locations within the study area and they maintained this pattern of horizontal distribution for at least 7 d. Acoustic observations revealed a scale of horizontal patchiness that was obscured by the "homogenization effect" of sampling by bottom trawl and plankton net. The shrimp underwent a nocturnal vertical migration with other zooplankton to > 200 m from the bottom and a subsequent downward migration during early daylight hours. This diel migration resulted in reduced availability of shrimp to the bottom trawl at night. Timing of the migrations varied, possibly as a result of interaction with oceanographic processes.

Evaluations were carried out in a model system of lipids extracted from sardine (Sardinops melanoxticta) skin. The course of the oxidation was evaluated measuring the oxygen uptake (mmol Of O-2/kg lipids), samples were incubated in closed cylinders at 40degreesC in darkness. The most effective combination observed was 0.01% Toc+0.5% Lec+0.05% AA. This treatment prolonged during 14 days the stage of the oxidation initiation. Higher concentrations of Toe promoted oxidation. The addition of 5% Lee although more effective for antioxidative purposes, affected drastically the color of the samples. Application of 0.01% Toe without synergists could only stop the oxidation for 4 days when compared with other commercial anti-oxidants (sodium erythorbate, BHA and TBHQ). This suggests that the combination of these antioxidants with synergists could be efficient. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Temporal variations of zooplankton biomass in the Ligurian Sea inferred from long time series of ADCP data	OCEAN SCIENCE												Three years of 300 kHz acoustic doppler current profiler data collected in the central Ligurian Sea are analysed to investigate the variability of the zooplankton biomass and the diel vertical migration in the upper thermocline. After a pre-processing phase aimed at avoiding the slant range attenuation, hourly volume backscattering strength time series are obtained. Despite the lack of concurrent net samples collection, different migration patterns are identified and their temporal variability examined by means of time-frequency analysis. The effect of changes in the environmental condition is also investigated. The highest zooplankton biomasses are observed in April-May just after the peak of surface primary production in March-April. The main migration pattern found here points to a 'nocturnal' migration, with zooplankton organisms occurring deeper in the water column during the day and shallower at night. Also, twilight migration is highlighted during this study. The largest migrations are recorded in November-December, corresponding to lowest backscattering strength values and they are likely attributable to larger and more active organisms (i.e. euphausiids and mesopelagic fish). The results suggest further applications of the available historical acoustic doppler current profiler time series.

Three different brands of Se food supplements were evaluated. These supplements were digested with HNO3 and H2O2 using a two-cycle microwave procedure. Electrothermal atomic absorption spectrometry (ETAAS) and hydride generation-atomic absorption spectrometry (HG-AAS) techniques were selected for total Se determination. The adverse effects of potentially interfering metals that are normally present in these products were taken into account. In particular, the effect of Cu, Mn, and Zn on the Se signal was investigated. Copper reduces the Se signal significantly when HG-AAS was used for quantification. On the other hand, no interference effects were detected when ETAAS was used and for this reason it was selected as the best alternative to analyze the samples. The overall approach was tested in tablets of vitamins-minerals-amino acids, nutritional supplements and Se-enriched yeast. The selenium content ranged from 15.9+/-0.7 to 81.1+/-3.3 mug of Se per tablet. The data obtained demonstrate that the Se content reported on the labels of dietary supplements are often inaccurate. The detection limits were found to be 0.18 mug g(-1) Se and 0.06 mug g(-1) Se for ETAAS and HG-AAS, respectively.

The formulation is actually an assemblage and adaptation of previously published approximate solutions rather than a generalization. The physics of the scattering is blurred through a multitude of empirical parameters. In order for this new ''generalized'' model to fit the data, the animals are required to change shape as the acoustic frequency changes (for any animal of fixed size, it is required to be a sphere at low frequencies, prolate spheroid at intermediate frequencies, and bent cylinder at high frequencies). The scattering models, as presented, are not only physically incorrect, but in two cases are not even dimensionally correct (terms that are dimensionless are added to terms of dimension area).

The first species, Hemimysis speluncola(<1 cm length), lives in the submarine cave, forming a distinct community that migrates horizontally. The second species, Siriella jaltensis (>1 cm length), lives in the open sea and migrates vertically. These species are both detected clearly at 120 kHz, but only the larger one, Siriella jaltensis, is detected at 38 kHz. This distinction allows one to determine the size limits of planktonic objects detected at these frequencies, i.e. 3 mm at 120 kHz and 10 mm at 38 kHz, corresponding to one quarter of the wavelength. The target strength (TS) of each species was calculated from the field data and compared to results calculated from three models. As the volume of the cave occupied by the Hemimysis population is about 300 m(3), and the density of the swarm is 36,000 individuals/m(3), the number of individuals in the cave is estimated to be around 10 million (or 24 kg). The density of the open-water population of Siriella is estimated to be 13 individuals/m(3). (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.

S. thompsoni was the dominant macrozooplankton species through the research periods although the abundance decreased markedly in autumn. In both summer and autumn we identified three geographically coherent subpopulations, which were considered to be either a mating swarm or physical aggregation. Many aggregate forms with an empty (dead) embryo were observed, and the ratio of newborn solitary forms decreased in autumn, indicating sexual reproduction of the salps was deactivated. The significant reduction in size of mature solitaries suggested that the capacity of asexual reproduction was also reduced in autumn. In addition to water temperature decline, the phytoplankton shortage (which was partly caused by high grazing pressure of S. thompsoni during summer) might be the factor causing decline in their own population size in autumn.																	0722-4060					NOV	1999	22	5					341	349		10.1007/s003000050427							WOS:000083378800006

Water soluble protein contents ranged from 16% to 38%, and lipid contents from 2.4% to 5.5% of dry mass. The molar C/N ratios were between 4.1 and 4.5.

J	MURPHY, EJ; RODHOUSE, PG; NOLAN, CP				MURPHY, EJ; RODHOUSE, PG; NOLAN, CP			MODELING THE SELECTIVE EFFECTS OF FISHING ON REPRODUCTIVE POTENTIAL AND POPULATION-STRUCTURE OF SQUID	ICES JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE												Artificial selection processes associated with harvesting may operate over relatively short time scales in short-lived semelparous species. The ommastrephid squid Illex argentinus on the Patagonian Shelf is the target of a major fishery. Recent work has provided new information on the biological characteristics of squid in this fishery. That information has been utilized in the development of a model of the cohort dynamics and some of the within-season selective effects considered. The model results are consistent with earlier data from the shelf fisheries, supporting suggestions that the males mature and migrate earlier towards the spawning grounds than the females. Earlier maturation results in a smaller mean size in the spawning stock, while later maturation results in greater exposure to the fishery and a reduced number of individuals surviving to spawn. Under the current fishing regime greater egg production and a larger spermatophoric complex mass for the whole cohort is achieved by relatively late maturation. In general, however, the earlier maturation occurs, the earlier is the peak in total egg production. The within-season pattern of effort expenditure in the fishery can affect not only yield from the fishery but also the reproductive potential of the spawning stock. The management policy adopted for this fishery is likely to be conservative in terms of maintenance of a spawning stock; however, the potential for selective effects is large and this may affect both yield and reproductive potential. The results are discussed in relation to short- and long-term effects in the fishery and the implications for future research requirements.																	1054-3139	1095-9289				AUG	1994	51	3					299	313		10.1006/jmsc.1994.1031							WOS:A1994PF60200007						
J	Endo, Y; Yamano, F				Endo, Yoshinari; Yamano, Fuhito			Diel vertical migration of Euphausia pacifica (Crustacea, Euphausiacea) in relation to molt and reproductive processes, and feeding activity	JOURNAL OF OCEANOGRAPHY												We investigated the diel vertical migration of Euphausia pacifica in relation to molt and reproductive processes and feeding activity in April and September 2001 at fixed stations off northeastern Japan. The vertical distribution of this species was shallower in April than in September during both day and night, which was partly explained by a high surface temperature (19 degrees C) and the existence of a subsurface chlorophyll maximum in September. It has been demonstrated for the first time that diel vertical migration of this species is influenced by molt processes because upward migration of molting individuals was restricted compared with non-molting ones. Feeding activity of molting individuals was reduced throughout the day, being lower than or similar to the daytime feeding activity of non-molting ones. The percentage of molting individuals was least (2-4%) among the gravid females, which suggests that gravid females molt less frequently than other stages of females and males. Molt and reproductive processes therefore seemed to be coupled in this species.																	0916-8370					OCT	2006	62	5					693	703		10.1007/s10872-006-0087-x							WOS:000240203100009

The maximum TS measured at the tilt angle of 0 degrees ranged from -68.8 to -60.8 dB, whereas the range of the theoretical TS was from -68.7 to -61.5 dB. The difference of the measured and theoretical values of the maximum TS was -1.6 to 0.9 dB, and the TS patterns showed good agreement, particularly in the range of the main lobes, in the tilt angle (-10 degrees to 10 degrees). The theoretical model was used to calculate the TS under the same conditions where the specimens were collected. The correlation between the SL and the maximum TS is given by the equation: TS=43.1 log SL-96.1.

Comparison of zooplankton vertical migration in an ice-free and a seasonally ice-covered Arctic fjord: An insight into the influence of sea ice cover on zooplankton behavior	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												We present observations of zooplankton diel vertical migration (DVM) over a period of 2 yr in an ice-free and a seasonally ice-covered Arctic fjord. The contrasting environments permitted assessment of the influences of physical and biological factors on temporal variability in DVM patterns and a test of the hypothesis that a reduction in summer sea ice extent and thickness following climatic warming will lead to changes in DVM via the loss of a shading effect on the pelagic marine environment. Acoustic backscatter and vertical velocity data from moored 300-kHz acoustic Doppler current profilers were used to derive DVM patterns, while measurements of sea ice and snow thickness enabled assessment of the underwater light environment and consideration of its potential to influence DVM. Pronounced differences in DVM between the sites emerged during summertime when intermittent synchronized DVM was observed at the ice-free site, whereas the ice-covered site was characterized by asynchronous behavior, thereby highlighting the influence of sea ice. Notably, the 0.8-m-thick sea ice cover was deemed important for its influence on water column properties such as food, turbidity, and zooplankton species composition, as indicated by biological samples from moored sediment traps, rather than a simple shading of the ocean and direct modification of zooplankton DVM. Loss of Arctic sea ice is likely to have an indirect but substantial effect on zooplankton DVM via modification of hydrography and composition of the pelagic community.

J	Harcourt, RG; Bradshaw, CJA; Dickson, K; Davis, LS				Harcourt, RG; Bradshaw, CJA; Dickson, K; Davis, LS			Foraging ecology of a generalist predator, the female New Zealand fur seal	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												This study examined how diet, foraging location and diving behaviour of female New Zealand fur seals Arctocephalus forsteri at Otago Peninsula, New Zealand (45degrees52' S, 170degrees44' E), varied in relation to prey abundance among seasons in 1994 and 1995. Time-depth recorders measured the diving behaviour of 24 lactating female fur seals, during summer, autumn or winter of 1994 and summer and autumn of 1995. Foraging locations were obtained by deploying satellite transmitters in summer, autumn and winter of 1994 only. Estimated biomass of prey items was determined from 690 scats and 166 regurgitates collected over summer, autumn and winter of both years, and compared with abundance data from research trawls in the same area. Foraging trip duration increased during the cooler seasons. Female fur seals showed a clear bout structure in dive behaviour, with the relative proportion of 3 main bout types (Long, Shallow, Deep) varying with season. Time between bouts (IBI) and bout duration varied with season, suggesting that prey distribution and prey encounter rate also varied. Linear discriminant analysis of the dive and foraging trip characteristics of individual females demonstrated clear seasonal differences. Females foraged on or near the continental slope in summer and farther offshore in autumn. Satellite telemetry locations and diet suggest principally inshore foraging during winter. Fur seals ate predominantly arrow squid Nototodarus sloanii during summer and autumn of both years, although fish, particularly myctophids, were persistent in the diet. Arrow squid were less common in winter when diet was more varied, and an inshore, benthic fish, ahuru Auchenoceros punctatus was dominant. There was no relationship between the annual changes in abundance of major prey species as measured by research trawls and their occurrence in seal diet. Overall, changes in dive behaviour may reflect changes in prey selection as prey abundance and availability change among seasons.

J	Green, JA; Boyd, IL; Woakes, AJ; Green, CJ; Butler, PJ				Green, JA; Boyd, IL; Woakes, AJ; Green, CJ; Butler, PJ			Do seasonal changes in metabolic rate facilitate changes in diving behaviour?	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY												Macaroni penguins were implanted with data loggers to record heart rate (f(H)), abdominal temperature (T-ab) and diving depth during their pre-moult trip (summer) and winter migration. The penguins showed substantial differences in diving behaviour between the seasons. During winter, mean and maximum dive duration and dive depth were significantly greater than during summer, but the proportion of dives within the calculated aerobic dive limit (cADL) did not change. Rates of oxygen consumption were estimated from f(H). As winter progressed, the rate of oxygen consumption during dive cycles (s(V)over dot(O2DC)) declined significantly and mirrored the pattern of increase in maximum duration and depth. The decline in s(V)over dot(O2DC) was matched by a decline in minimum rate of oxygen consumption (s(V)over dot(O2min)). When s(V)over dot(O2min) was subtracted from S(V)over dot(O2DC), the net cost of diving was unchanged between summer and winter. We suggest that the increased diving capacity demonstrated during the winter was facilitated by the decrease in s(V)over dot(O2min). Abdominal temperature declined during winter but this was not sufficient to explain the decline in s(V)over dot(O2min). A simple model of the interactions between s(V)over dot(O2min), thermal conductance and water temperature shows how a change in the distribution of fat stores and therefore a change in insulation and/or a difference in foraging location during winter could account for the observed reduction in s(V)over dot(O2min) and hence s(V)over dot(O2DC).

They presented a high stability in the raw material, retaining over 45% of the initial activity after 30 days of storage at pH 8.0, 45 degrees C. The purified TLEs had relative molecular mass between 32 kDa and 33 kDa. With higher stability and greater activity, they had similar stability and activity profiles (pH 6.0-11.0, 15-65 degrees C) as bovine trypsin but had a different optimum temperature (35 degrees C for trypsin and 45 degrees C for TLEs). Similar to bovine trypsin, the purified TLEs could be activated by Ca2+ and Mg2+. And the purified TLEs also showed similar inhibitory profiles as bovine trypsin with the exception of chicken egg ovomucoid (CEOM), an effective inhibitor of bovine trypsin but less so for purified TLEs. Having TLEs with physiological efficiency 3.6 times that of bovine trypsin, the use of mysis as a source for commercial production of TLEs is discussed.																	1573-3149	1573-3904				JUN	2008	14	2					75	80		10.1007/s10989-007-9102-3							WOS:000255878700001

The three main carotenoid pigments, making up 85-90% of the total carotenoid content were separated by silica thin-layer chromatography and identified as astaxanthin and its mono- and diesters. The relative composition of the three pigments was maintained at 5, 49 and 40% each of the total carotenes throughout the study. Temporal variations in individual and weight specific levels of the total were observed, and appeared to be influenced by season and stage of sexual maturity. Results suggest that E. pacifica can structurally manipulate a wide variety of carotenoid molecules and can only deposit astaxanthin and its two esters in a specific ratio. Possible functions of these pigments are discussed.																	0022-0981						1991	148	1					93	104		10.1016/0022-0981(91)90149-Q							WOS:A1991FT25400008						
J	Gorokhova, E				Gorokhova, E			Moult cycle and its chronology in Mysis mixta and Neomysis integer (Crustacea, Mysidacea): implications for growth assessment	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY												The moult-staging technique was used to determine the main moult stages (MS) and their duration in laboratory-reared juveniles and subadults of Mysis mixta and Neomysis integer. The relative duration of each stage was similar for both species with premoult occupying the major part of the moult cycle (51% and 44% for M. mixta and N. integer, respectively), followed by postmoult (26% and 34%) and intermoult (23% and 22%). Effects of temperature and feeding regimes on the chronology of the moult cycle were investigated. When the duration of the moult cycle (MCD) was extended by manipulating the feeding regime, animals prolonged their late postmoult and early premoult stages. At 12 and 5 degreesC, no specific moult stage varied in relative duration as long as food supply was high. Field application of moult staging for growth assessment was tested using wild-caught M mixta. The MCD estimated via moulting experiments was compared to that obtained by analyzing moult stage distribution combined with the experimentally obtained data on stage duration. Close correspondence between two methods of MCD assessment was observed with moultstaging technique being particularly useful in situations when conducting of experiments immediately after collection is not feasible.

J	Benoit-Bird, KJ; Gilly, WF				Benoit-Bird, Kelly J.; Gilly, William F.			Coordinated nocturnal behavior of foraging jumbo squid Dosidicus gigas	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												We used split-beam acoustic techniques to observe free-swimming of jumbo squid Dosidicus gigas during 4 cruises in the Gulf of California. Four-dimensional spatio-temporal data revealed that at night in shallow water, jumbo squid were using ascending, spiral-like swimming paths to emerge from extremely dense aggregations, and were likely foraging on potential prey that were found overlapping in depth with their tracks. Within small regions at the vertices of these swimming paths, individual squid swam back and forth repetitively before continuing their ascent. The behaviors observed in these high-use regions, described using density kernel statistics, are consistent with other observations of prey capture behavior by squid. Often, the observed swimming paths of individual squid were found to parallel those of other squid in depth over time. In addition to being coordinated in depth, movements of individuals within a group of up to 40 individuals were coordinated in horizontal space so that high-use areas were overlapping in horizontal space but separated vertically. The resulting groups of tracks look like interwoven multiple helices anchored at their vertices by bouts of presumed feeding. These highly polarized, complex, coordinated movement patterns constitute schooling. Polarization in these groups did not break down during apparent feeding events as has been observed in other species. In fact, the feeding events themselves may define the anchor for group behavior. Schooling of jumbo squid school will likely be critical in understanding many aspects of their biology.																	0171-8630	1616-1599					2012	455						211	228		10.3354/meps09664							WOS:000304607100014

Inhibitors in foods and food ingredients can reduce the absorption of free amino acids, and can impair protein hydrolysis in industrial processes. However, inhibitors can be useful tools in pest control, in the prevention and treatment of diseases such as cancers and AIDS, and in the elimination of unwanted proteinase activity in food processes. Proteinase inhibitors are also useful biochemical tools for studying proteinase classes and specificities.

Perspectives on marine zooplankton lipids	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												We developed new perspectives to identify important questions and to propose approaches for future research on marine food web lipids. They were related to (i) structure and function of lipids, (ii) lipid changes during critical life phases, (iii) trophic marker lipids, and (iv) potential impact of climate change. The first addresses the role of lipids in membranes, storage lipids, and buoyancy with the following key question: How are the properties of membranes and deposits affected by the various types of lipids? The second deals with the importance of various types of lipids during reproduction, development, and resting phases and addresses the role of the different storage lipids during growth and dormancy. The third relates to trophic marker lipids, which are an important tool to follow lipid and energy transfer through the food web. The central question is how can fatty acids be used to identify and quantify food web relationships? With the fourth, hypotheses are presented on effects of global warming, which may result in the reduction or change in abundance of large, lipid-rich copepods in polar oceans, thereby strongly affecting higher trophic levels. The key question is how will lipid dynamics respond to changes in ocean climate at high latitudes?.

Temporal changes in lipid biomarkers, especially fatty acids, of the deep-sea crustaceans Boreomysis arctica and Nematoscelis megalops: implications of their biological cycle and habitat near the seabed	JOURNAL OF THE MARINE BIOLOGICAL ASSOCIATION OF THE UNITED KINGDOM												Two species of benthopelagic deep-water crustaceans, the suprabenthic mysid Boreomysis arctica and the bathypelagic euphausiid Nematoscelis megalops were analysed in their lipidic composition, with especial emphasis on fatty acids, from specimens obtained in the north-west of Mallorca (Balearic Islands, western Mediterranean) at depths ranging between 650 and 780 m. Temporal shifts were studied seasonally, based on five cruises performed in August and November 2003, and February, April and June 2004, using a Macer-GIROQ suprabenthic sledge (0.5 mm mesh size). Evidences of omnivorous and carnivorous feeding habits were found for both species derived from their fatty acid and other lipid profiles. Boreomysis arctica showed a more varied fatty acid profile than N. megalops. This suggests that B. arctica feeds on a wider range of food sources and is a more opportunistic feeder. The high proportions of 16:1(n-7), 20:5(n-3) and 22:6(n-3) fatty acids in both species suggests a link between surface primary production and deep slope habitats, while markers such as 18:1(n-9) and the 20:1(n-9) and 22:1(n-11) fatty alcohols indicate a predatory activity, likely on calanoids. These components may arrive both via phytodetritus deposition to the seabed and by migratory movements of prey consumed by B. arctica and N. megalops close to the sea bottom. Seasonal changes in the total lipids and fatty acid composition of both species are related to the seasonal dynamics in their food sources, coupled with changes in the physiological or developmental stage of individuals. The proportion of total lipids and polyunsaturated fatty acids in the two species may be related to the different life histories of B. arctica and N. megalops. The mysid has direct development of embryos within brood pouches, so eggs with large amount of vitelum are generated and gonad is well developed. By contrast, the meso-bathypelagic euphausiids generate planktotrophic larvae, with a high number of free developmental larvae stages (from nauplius to Furcilia/Calyptopis), and eggs with poor storage of lipid compounds compared with B. arctica embryos.																	0025-3154	1469-7769				JUN	2011	91	4					783	792		10.1017/S0025315410002018							WOS:000290213000003						
J	Clarke, J; Emmerson, LM; Otahal, P				Clarke, Judy; Emmerson, Louise M.; Otahal, Petr			Environmental conditions and life history constraints determine foraging range in breeding Adelie penguins	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												Foraging movements of Adelie penguins are constrained both by environmental conditions (e.g. sea ice cover) and life history factors (e.g. regular offspring provisioning), We describe within season changes in foraging range, trip duration and body condition of Adelie penguins nesting at Bechervaise Island, East Antarctica, in the context of these constraints. Penguins were satellite tracked over multiple seasons during the incubation, guard, creche and pre-moult phases of their annual cycle. They ranged farthest during incubation when sea ice was extensive and shortest during the guard stage when chicks were small and sea ice limited in extent. Prior to their annual moult the birds foraged hundreds of kilometres to the west and east of their breeding sites. A recurrent polynya facilitated access to the sea early in the season when ice cover was extensive. Kernel analyses showed that penguins foraged most intensively close to the colony, along submarine canyons and at the continental shelf break. Increases in foraging range, as the chick rearing period progressed, were consistent with changing energy requirements of adults and chicks and likely intraspecific competition. Whilst provisioning their offspring, penguins adopted a variable combination of time minimising and food maximising foraging behaviour in which choice of foraging rule was determined largely by adult body condition.																	0171-8630	1616-1599					2006	310						247	261		10.3354/meps310247							WOS:000237558000022

In this work, an acoustic scattering model has been developed for fluid-like zooplankton that is based on the distorted wave Born approximation (DWBA) and that makes use of high-resolution three-dimensional measurements of the animal's outer boundary shape. High-resolution computerized tomography (CT) was used to determine the three-dimensional digitizations of animal shape. This study focuses on developing the methodology for incorporating high-resolution CT scans into a scattering model that is generally valid for any body with fluid-like material properties. The model predictions are compared to controlled laboratory measurements of the acoustic backscattering from live individual decapod shrimp. The frequency range used was 50 kHz to 1 MHz and the angular characteristics of the backscattering were investigated with up to a 1degrees angular resolution. The practical conditions under which it is necessary to make use of high-resolution digitizations of shape are assessed. 9 2002 Acoustical Society of America.

The purified enzyme showed a single band on polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and the specific activity was determined to be 7990 U/mg. The molecular weight of the whole enzyme was determined to be 132.0 kD, and the enzyme is composed of two identical subunits with molecular mass of 65.8 kD. The optimum pH and optimum temperature of the enzyme for the hydrolysis of p-nitrophenyl-N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminide (pNP-NAG) were found to be at pH 5.6 and at 50 degrees C, respectively The study of its stability showed that the enzyme is stable in the pH range from 4.6 to 8.6 and at temperatures below 45 degrees C. The kinetic behavior of the enzyme in the hydrolysis of pNP-NAG followed Michaelis-Menten kinetics with K-m of 0.424 +/- 0.012 mM and V-max of 17.65 +/- 0.32 mu mol/min at pH 5.8 and 37 degrees C, and the activation energy was determined to be 61.32 kJ/mol. The effects of some metal ions on the enzyme were surveyed, and the results show that Na+ and K+ have no effects on the enzyme activity; Mg2+ and Ca2+ slightly activate the enzyme, while Ba2+, Zn2+, Mn2+, Hg2+, Pb2+, Cu2+, and Al3+ inhibit the enzyme to different extents.

These data are used to estimate various parameters of foraging activity, e.g. foraging range, prey capture rates, and are compared in relation to breeding chronology. Foraging trip duration was 6 h and 10 h, and trip frequency 1.0/day and 0.96/day, during the brooding and creche periods, respectively. Birds spent on average 52% of each foraging trip diving. Dive depth and duration were highly bimodal: shallow dives (< 21 m) averaged 4 m and 0.23 min, and deep dives (> 30 m) 80 m and 2.5 min, respectively. Birds spent on average 71% and 25% of total diving time in deep and shallow dives, respectively. For deep dives, dive duration exceeded the subsequent surface interval, but shallow dives were followed by surface intervals 2-3 times dive duration. We suggest that most shallow dives are searching/exploratory dives and most deep dives are feeding dives. Deep dives showed clear diel patterns averaging 40 m at dawn and dusk and 80-90 m at midday. Estimated foraging ranges were 2.3 km and 4.1 km during the brood and creche period, respectively. Foraging trip duration increased by 4 h between the brood and creche periods but total time spent in deep dives (i.e. time spent feeding) was the same (3 h). Of 99 foraging trips, 56% consisted of only one dive bout and 44% of 2-4 bouts delimited by extended surface intervals > 10 min. We suggest that this pattern of diving activity reflects variation in spatial distribution of prey rather than the effect of physiological constraints on diving ability.

Experimental determination of dominant scattering mechanisms	JOURNAL OF THE ACOUSTICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA					ICES International Symposium on Fisheries and Plankton Acoustics	JUN 12-16, 1995	MARINE LAB, ABERDEEN, SCOTLAND	Int Council Explorat Sea, Inst Acoust, Acoust Soc Amer, Soc Francaise Acoust	MARINE LAB			The acoustic scattering properties of live individual zooplankton from several gross anatomical groups have been investigated. The groups involve (1) euphausiids (Meganyctiphanes norvegica) whose bodies behave acoustically as a fluid material, (2) gastropods (Limacina retroversa) whose bodies include a hard elastic shell, and (3) siphonophores (Agalma okeni or elegans and Nanomia cara) whose bodies contain a gas inclusion (pneumatophore). The animals were collected from ocean waters off New England (Slope Water, Georges Bank, and the Gulf of Maine), The scattering properties were measured over parts or all of the frequency range 50 kHz to 1 MHz in a laboratory-style pulse-echo setup in a large tank at sea using live fresh specimens, Individual echoes as well as averages and ping-to-ping fluctuations of repeated echoes were studied, The material type of each group is shown to strongly affect both the overall echo level and pattern of the target strength versus frequency plots, In this first article of a two-part series, the dominant scattering mechanisms of the three animal types are determined principally by examining the structure of both the frequency spectra of individual broadband echoes and the compressed pulse (time series) output. Other information is also used involving the effect on overall levels due to (1) animal orientation and (2) tissue in animals having a gas inclusion (siphonophores). The results of this first paper show that (1) the euphausiids behave as weakly scattering fluid bodies and there are major contributions from at least two parts of the body to the echo (the number of contributions depends upon angle of orientation and shape), (2) the gastropods produce echoes from the front interface and possibly from a slow-traveling circumferential (Lamb) wave, and (3) the gas inclusion of the siphonophore dominates the echoes, but the tissue plays a role in the scattering and is especially important when analyzing echoes from individual animals on a ping-by-ping basis, The results of this paper serve as the basis for the development of acoustic scattering models in the companion paper [Stanton et al., J. Acoust. Sec. Am, 103, 236-253 (1998)]. (C) 1998 Acoustical Society of America.

Protein was the major component of the FPH ranging 82-86%. The effects of 5% FPH (dried weight/wet weight) on the state of water and the denaturation of lizard fish Saurida wanieso myofibrils were evaluated by desorption isotherm curves, Ca-ATPase activity, and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) during dehydration. The myofibrils with FPH showed a decreased water activity (Aw), while they exhibited significantly higher Ca-ATPase activity compared to myofibrils without FPH (control). The myofibrils with FPH had higher amount of unfrozen water than the control. These results suggest that the FPH suppressed dehydration-induced denaturation, which seems to be attributable to the stabilization of the hydrated water surrounding the myofibrils.																	1344-6606					AUG	2003	9	3					257	263		10.3136/fstr.9.257							WOS:000185549000010						
J	DEMER, DA; MARTIN, LV				DEMER, DA; MARTIN, LV			ZOOPLANKTON TARGET STRENGTH - VOLUMETRIC OR AREAL DEPENDENCE	JOURNAL OF THE ACOUSTICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA												Target strengths (TS) of various zooplankton were measured at 200 kHz, 420 kHz, and 1 MHz and the dependence of these data on animal volume versus cross-sectional area was explored. The 420-kHz and 1-MHz data were collected with a dual-beam sonar system and the 200-kHz data with a split-beam system. Experiments were conducted with live, tethered individuals in an enclosure filled with filtered seawater. The data were compared to both empirical and theoretical models of reduced target strength (TS normalized by the square of the animal length) versus ka (the product of wave number and equivalent cylindrical radius). The theoretical models chosen for this comparison were two versions of a high-pass bent-cylinder model (Stanton, 1989b) that indicate TS is dependent on animal volume, and the ray bent-cylinder model (Stanton, 1993a) which implies TS is dependent on the cross-sectional area. The dependence of acoustic backscattering on animal volume or area was tested by fitting regression lines for TS versus the logs of ka, length (L), wet weight (WW), and dry weight (DW). Contrary to an empirical model derived from similar experiments (Wiebe et al., 1990), and to the high-pass models, the regressions indicated that TS is proportional to the cross-sectional area of the animal. However, because scattering from individual zooplankton is highly nonlinear, especially in the geometric scattering region (ka>1), linear regressions of TS versus the log of ka, L, WW, or DW can be misleading. Furthermore, neither Wiebe er al. (1990) nor this experiment directly accounted for animal orientations. Simulations using a distorted-wave Born-approximation model (Chu et al., 1993), indicated that animal behavior is an important factor in the scattering characteristics of zooplankton. Different distributions of animal tilt angle can influence the general trend of the TS model to exhibit either areal or near volumetric dependence.

J	Leong, D; Ross, T; Lavery, A				Leong, Doris; Ross, Tetjana; Lavery, Andone			Anisotropy in high-frequency broadband acoustic backscattering in the presence of turbulent microstructure and zooplankton	JOURNAL OF THE ACOUSTICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA												High-frequency broadband (120-600 kHz) acoustic backscattering measurements have been made in the vicinity of energetic internal waves. The transducers on the backscattering system could be adjusted so as to insonify the water-column either vertically or horizontally. The broadband capabilities of the system allowed spectral classification of the backscattering. The distribution of spectral shapes is significantly different for scattering measurements made with the transducers oriented horizontally versus vertically, indicating that scattering anisotropy is present. However, the scattering anisotropy could not be unequivocally explained by either turbulent microstructure or zooplankton, the two primary sources of scattering expected in internal waves. Daytime net samples indicate a predominance of short-aspect-ratio zooplankton. Using zooplankton acoustic scattering models, a preferential orientation of the observed zooplankton cannot explain the measured anisotropy. Yet model predictions of scattering from anisotropic turbulent microstructure, with inputs from coincident microstructure measurements, were not consistent with the observations. Possible explanations include bandwidth limitations that result in many spectra that cannot be unambiguously attributed to turbulence or zooplankton based on spectral shape. Extending the acoustic bandwidth to cover the range from 50 kHz to 2MHz could help improve identification of the dominant sources of backscattering anisotropy. (C) 2012 Acoustical Society of America.

The results showed that appropriate concentrations of betaine could lead to reversible inhibition against NAGase, and the IC50 value was estimated to be 15.00 +/- 0.30 mM. The inhibitory kinetics assay showed that betaine was a mixed type inhibitor with a K-I value of 9.17 +/- 0.85 mM and a K-IS value of 45.58 +/- 2.52 mM. The inhibitory model was set, and the microscopic rate constants were determined using the kinetic method of the substrate reaction. The time course of the hydrolysis of pNP-NAG catalyzed by NAGase in the presence of different betaine concentrations showed that at each betaine concentration, the rate decreased with an increase in time until a straight line was approached, indicating that the inhibition of NAGase by betaine is a slow, reversible reaction with fractional residual activity. The fact that k(+0) is much larger than k(+0) indicated that the free enzyme molecule is more fragile than the enzyme-substrate complex against betaine. It is suggested that the presence of the substrate offers marked protection of NAGase against inhibition by betaine.

J	Taki, K				Taki, Kenji			Distribution and population structure of Thysanoessa inspinata and its dominance among euphausiids off northeastern Japan	JOURNAL OF PLANKTON RESEARCH												Distribution and population structure of Thysanoessa inspinata were investigated off northeastern Japan and compared with those of Euphausia pacifica and other Thysanoessa species. Thysanoessa inspinata were distributed as widely as E. pacifica, but their abundance in the transitional water mass area (TWA) was conspicuously lower than in the cooler Oyashio water mass area (OWA). Another three Subarctic species of Thysanoessa occurred restrictively in the OWA, but rarely occurred during summer-autumn when sea surface temperature increased up to nearly 20 degrees C. Thysanoessa inspinata was distributed in surface waters at night in the OWA in spring, but in the middle layers during summer-autumn; in contrast, E. pacifica occurred near the surface throughout the year. Euphausia pacifica was >7 times more abundant than T. inspinata in the OWA, whereas T. inspinata was >90% of the total numbers of Thysanoessa spp. Temperature tolerances may strongly affect the degree of dominance of euphausiids and explain why the TWA is the southern limit of T. inspinata distribution, perhaps by restricting its access to the food-rich surface waters. Growth of males of T. inspinata was slower than that of females. Evidence from this study corroborates that E. pacifica is the key euphausiid species for food of surface-migratory Pacific saury during summer-autumn.																	0142-7873	1464-3774				JUN	2011	33	6					891	906		10.1093/plankt/fbq162							WOS:000290394300005

These data suggest bias from such effects should be taken into account when performing surveys and stock assessments in the Arctic. For organisms that remain active in one of the last undisturbed and pristine dark environments on the planet-the Arctic Polar Night-the moon, stars and aurora borealis may provide important cues to guide distribution and behaviours, including predator-prey interactions. With a changing climate and increased human activities in the Arctic, such natural light sources will in many places be masked by the much stronger illumination from artificial light. Here we show that normal working-light from a ship may disrupt fish and zooplankton behaviour down to at least 200 m depth across an area of >0.125 km(2) around the ship. Both the quantitative and qualitative nature of the disturbance differed between the examined regions. We conclude that biological surveys in the dark from illuminated ships may introduce biases on biological sampling, bioacoustic surveys, and possibly stock assessments of commercial and non-commercial species.

Adults, eggs, nauplii, metanauplii, calyptopis I-III, and furcilia I-II were found in the investigation. The abundance of larvae averaged 1 172.8 ind./m(2), with calyptopis I and II as the dominant stages. Habitat occupancy patterns varied among Euphausia superba at different stages, and three sub-regionswere identified by cluster analysis. The degree of larval development increased fromwest to east. Larvae were not observed north of the South Shetland Islands. Calyptopis I was predominant in the water between Elephant Island and the South Orkney Islands, which featured no thermocline. Older stages, including calyptopis II and III and furcilia I and II, were common in north and northeast of the South Orkney Islands, which were characterized by high temperature and high chlorophyll concentration. Distribution and abundance of the early life stages of E. superba were associated with specific environmental conditions. According to Biota-Environment matching (BIOENV), the distributions of E. superba larvae were correlated with a combination of temperature at the surface and 200m, and 0-100 mintegrated chlorophyll a concentration.																	0253-505X	1869-1099				NOV	2013	32	11					59	67		10.1007/s13131-013-0378-1							WOS:000327079700008

Larvae of 11 species were identified. Of these, Thysanoessa gregaria is reported for the first time from the Adriatic Sea. Information is presented on the distribution and diet migrations of the five dominant species. Nematoscelis megalops furciliae had the widest bathymetric range, extending from surface to the bottom (1200 m); larvae of Stylocheiron maximum were found from 100 to 1200 m. Euphausia krohnii (calyptopes and furciliae), Stylocheiron abbreviatum calyptopes, and Stylocheiron longicorne furciliae ranged over 800 m. S. abbreviatum (furciliae) and S. longicorne (calyptopes) had more restricted bathymetric distributions. Different populations were associated with layers characterized by specific light intensities. Three migration patterns were observed: (i) nocturnal ascent to upper layers (E. krohnii, N. megalops, S. abbreviatum); (ii) scattered population through the water column (S. maximum); (iii) migration to upper layers at midday and night, and descent during the morning and evening (S. longicorne). Different stages of the same species showed different preferences for light intensity.																	0011-216X	1568-5403				MAY	2012	85	6					659	684		10.1163/156854012X643942							WOS:000306632900003

The main objectives were to conduct experiments with a medium-sized, autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) equipped with a fishery-acoustic scientific payload. This was needed to overcome the difficulties of sampling the surface and bottom blind zones, which are inaccessible to conventional, vessel-mounted transducers used for acoustic surveys in the Bay of Biscay. The AUV acoustic datasets from four dives were compared with those from the research vessel. The results were expressed for the nautical-area-scattering coefficient (s(A)) and biomass estimates. The AUV provided higher s(A) measurements than did the vessel. For particular environmental and fish-distribution patterns, the biomass estimated by the AUV was more than ten times that estimated by the vessel alone. The results presented indicate the magnitude of the error that may occur in acoustic surveys, if the biomass in the two blind zones is undetected.

Feeding ecology and population delineation of south-eastern Atlantic and south-western Indian Ocean humpback whales using stable isotope analysis	AQUATIC CONSERVATION-MARINE AND FRESHWATER ECOSYSTEMS												Population delineation is vital for effectively managing and protecting populations of all at-risk species. Population boundaries of Southern Hemisphere humpback whales on their breeding and feeding grounds have not been fully resolved. A number of methods have been used to delineate breeding stocks of Southern Hemisphere humpbacks, but ecological characteristics determined via stable isotope analysis provide valuable information to contrast other data sources. In this study, stable isotope analysis is used to investigate potential separation of humpback whale populations on Southern Hemisphere feeding grounds as evidenced by carbon and nitrogen isotope values in their skin as proxies of diet. One hundred samples of whale skin obtained from biopsies in sampling localities off the coasts of Gabon, Mayotte (Mozambique Channel), and Madagascar were analysed for carbon (delta C-13) and nitrogen (delta N-15) stable isotope ratios. The results showed a statistically significant difference in the mean delta N-15 values for whales between the populations from Gabon and Madagascar (7.0 +/- 0.1 parts per thousand and 7.6 +/- 0.1 parts per thousand), and Gabon and Mayotte (7.6 +/- 0.1 parts per thousand and 7.2 +/- 0.1 parts per thousand), indicating that these breeding stocks are potentially visiting different areas of the feeding grounds outside of the breeding season. The results from this study indicate that at least some breeding stocks may show fidelity to separate feeding areas and do not widely mix with individuals from other breeding stocks while feeding.

The molecular weight was estimated as 32.8 kDa using SDSPAGE. The optimum pH and temperature of the enzyme for the hydrolysis of casein were determined to be 10.0 and 40A degrees C. It was stable at pH range from 8.0 to 11.0 and had good thermal stability. Pb2+, Ca2+, Mg2+, Cu2+, and Mn2+ could active the enzyme certainly when Zn2+ and Hg2+ strongly inhibited the activity. The enzyme was inhibited by the general serine protease inhibitor (PMSF) and the specific trypsin inhibitors (TLCK, SBTI). The modification of various amino acid modifiers for the purified enzyme determined that the enzyme active center included tryptophan, histidine, and serine, moreover, arginine had a certain relationship with the enzyme activity.																	1226-7708	2092-6456				AUG	2012	21	4					1129	1134		10.1007/s10068-012-0147-5							WOS:000308112000027

Zinc is one of the most important metals often found in the pollutant. In this article, the effects of Zn2+ on prawn NAGase activity for the hydrolysis of pNP-NAG have been investigated. The results showed that Zn2+ could reversibly and noncompetitively inhibit the enzyme activity at appropriate concentrations and its IC50 value was estimated to be 6.00 +/- 0.25 mM. The inhibition model was set up, and the inhibition kinetics of the enzyme by Zn2+ has been studied using the kinetic method of the substrate reaction. The inhibition constant was determined to he 11.96 mM and the microscopic rate constants were also determined for inactivation and reactivation. The rate constant of the inactivation (k(+0)) is much larger than that of the reactivation (k(-0)). Therefore, when the Zn2+ concentration is sufficiently large, the enzyme is completely inactivated. On increasing the concentration of Zn2+, the fluorescence emission peak and the UV absorbance peak are not position shifted, but the intensity decreased, indicating that the conformation of Zn2+-bound inactive NAGase is stable and different front that of native NAGase. We presumed that Zn2+ made changes in the activity and conformation of prawn NAGase by binding with the histidine or cysteine residues of the enzyme.

Tracking macaroni penguins during long foraging trips using 'behavioural geolocation'	POLAR BIOLOGY												The movement of marine vertebrates has been tracked using a variety of techniques, all of which depend on the external attachment of a transmitting or recording device. However, these devices can have negative effects on the subject animals, limiting both the quantity and quality of data collected. We present a new method for monitoring large-scale movement of marine vertebrates that uses behavioural data stored on a surgically implanted data logger. The technique ('behavioural geolocation') relies on the principles of light-based geolocation but rather than measuring ambient light levels, changes in diving behaviour associated with sunrise and sunset are used to infer daylength and time of local sunrise, and hence location. We present data from a trial, post-hoc, analysis of diving data collected from macaroni penguins Eudyptes chrysolophus during long foraging trips associated with incubation and preparation for moult. Our results showed that the penguins usually travelled to the polar frontal zone to the north of their breeding colony at South Georgia, an area broadly consistent with previously measured behaviour and the availability of preferred prey at this period of the annual cycle.

C.; Brown, David S.; Jarman, Simon N.; Taberlet, Pierre			Who is eating what: diet assessment using next generation sequencing	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY												The analysis of food webs and their dynamics facilitates understanding of the mechanistic processes behind community ecology and ecosystem functions. Having accurate techniques for determining dietary ranges and components is critical for this endeavour. While visual analyses and early molecular approaches are highly labour intensive and often lack resolution, recent DNA-based approaches potentially provide more accurate methods for dietary studies. A suite of approaches have been used based on the identification of consumed species by characterization of DNA present in gut or faecal samples. In one approach, a standardized DNA region (DNA barcode) is PCR amplified, amplicons are sequenced and then compared to a reference database for identification. Initially, this involved sequencing clones from PCR products, and studies were limited in scale because of the costs and effort required. The recent development of next generation sequencing (NGS) has made this approach much more powerful, by allowing the direct characterization of dozens of samples with several thousand sequences per PCR product, and has the potential to reveal many consumed species simultaneously (DNA metabarcoding). Continual improvement of NGS technologies, on-going decreases in costs and current massive expansion of reference databases make this approach promising. Here we review the power and pitfalls of NGS diet methods. We present the critical factors to take into account when choosing or designing a suitable barcode. Then, we consider both technical and analytical aspects of NGS diet studies. Finally, we discuss the validation of data accuracy including the viability of producing quantitative data.

However, the precision of the backscattered signal measured by single ADCP measurement has a limitation in the MVBS variation of zooplankton. The objectives of this study were to analyze the MVBS and vertical velocity from ADCPs at the same time and location for zooplankton's daily vertical migration (DVM) observation. Measurements were conducted in Lembeh Strait, North Sulawesi, Indonesia. Instruments used included a moored ADCP 750 kHz and a mobile ADCP 307.2 kHz. High MVBS value was found at 11.5-16 m depths and was identified as the sound scattering layer (SSL). The DVM patterns in the SSL displayed significant differences over time and had good relationships with the diurnal cycle. Theoretical target strength (TS) from the scattering models based on a distorted-wave Born approximation (DWBA) was estimated for Oithona sp. and Paracalanus sp.; the two dominant species found in the observed area. However, MVBS and TS proved that the dominant zooplankton species were not the main scatterers. The strong signal in SSL was instead caused by the schools of various zooplankton species.

This limit is characterized by the sampling efficiency of the gear. Acoustic monitoring can be used to determine the sampling efficiencies of this gear, as its non-invasive, wide-range sweeps provide more reliable estimates of absolute abundance of the target species. The density measured by the gear can then be standardized by multiplying the initial density measurement by the derived sampling efficiency. In this study, we compared the estimated densities of the dominant zooplankton in the sound scattering layer (SSL) from acoustic monitoring to the densities of the same species measured using the FMT and ring net. The respective sampling efficiencies of this gear for zooplankton categories was then determined using linear regression models. For small Euphausiidae and Copepoda, the sampling efficiency of ring net was higher than that of FMT. In contrast, the ring net was less effective than FMT for large Euphausiidae. These results highlight that the entering and retention rates of the species depend on the type and characteristics of the survey gear, as well as the size and swimming ability of the target species.

Three dimensional structure and morphology of pelagic fish schools	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ICHTHYOLOGY												In fish resource assessment, it is very important to know about the behaviour and form of fish schools. This paper describes the three-dimensional (3D) morphology and internal structure of pelagic schools observed using vertical-scanning multibeam sonar. The acoustic data were collected in waters off Venezuela, Senegal, and Mexico. The data were used to derive metrics of school location, density, shape and internal structure from a total of 668 schools: 257 from Mexico, 343 from Venezuela and 68 from Senegal. In general, school shapes were amoeboid-like (e. g. spheres or ellipsoids) and not simply geometric. Also, the fish were patchily-distributed, forming both nuclei (groups) and vacuoles (empty spaces) within the schools. The results support the hypothesis of 'auto-organization of the fish inside schools' meaning that the distribution of fish within a school arises from the elementary reaction of the individuals.

Despite substantial research on this species, there is no comprehensive understanding of the population genetics of E. superba yet. In this study, the ND6 gene was used to assess the genetic variation in E. superba. In the South Shetland Islands, the population of E. superba shows abundant genetic variation, but we found a lack of genetic structure. An analysis of the demographic history suggested that a sudden expansion has been responsible for its high biomass. Our study could not only broaden our comprehension of E. superba, but also provide more scientific information on fisheries resources exploitation, biodiversity conservation and the maintenance of a proper ecological balance.																	0011-216X	1568-5403				DEC	2019	92	11-12					1295	1309		10.1163/15685403-00003950							WOS:000503831700003						
J	MACAULAY, MC				MACAULAY, MC			GENERALIZED TARGET STRENGTH MODEL FOR EUPHAUSIIDS, WITH APPLICATIONS TO OTHER ZOOPLANKTON	JOURNAL OF THE ACOUSTICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA												A hybrid model has been developed that generates predictions of euphausiid target strengths similar to those observed by direct measurement. The controlling variables of the model account for the size, shape, orientation, and stochastic nature of orientation. Sound speed and density contrast values used are within the range of those directly observed. This suggests that it is possible to produce a generalized target strength prediction for euphausiids like those available for fish. Euphausiids appear to be better generalized as a bent cylindrical or bent spheroid targets rather than spherical targets, at least for frequencies greater than 100 kHz. Although the model is based on a single, limited data set, its predictions compare well with the results, of a number of recently published measurements and models of target strength. The model also resolves some puzzling contradictions of target strength frequency dependency previously observed, but unexplained. A number of items were determined to be needed to complete or further refine such hybrid models: Target strength measurements for more sizes, species, and frequencies (especially below 50 kHz and above 420 kHz) are most prominent among these.																	0001-4966					MAY	1994	95	5	1				2452	2466		10.1121/1.409855							WOS:A1994NK79900018

X. testudinatus is adapted to a sulfur-rich and thus potentially toxic environment. It has established a specialized feeding strategy focusing on dead zooplankton organisms killed by the toxic discharges from the vents. During slack water, when there is little or no current, the crabs leave their crevices to feed on this 'marine snow'. In the present study, we investigated the physiological aspects of nutritional adaptations of X. testudinatus. The crabs showed high digestive capacities of major digestive enzymes and particularly high activities for proteolytic enzymes. This feature can be regarded as an adaptation to irregular food availability. Furthermore, enzymes were stable at elevated temperatures, in a wide pH range, and in the presence of inorganic inhibitors like Cu2+, Fe2+, or Co2+. These enzyme properties can be considered essential to functioning in a vent habitat over long exposure times. Moreover, X. testudinatus is able to store significant amounts of lipid (50 to 60% of dry mass in the midgut gland), which may help to overcome periods of food scarcity. Fatty acid profiles revealed high amounts of saturated and monounsaturated components (mainly 16:0, 16:1(n-7), 18:1(n-9), and 18:1(n-7)). These findings reflect physiological adaptations and energetic strategies that enable this crab to exist in this extreme hydrothermal vent habitat.

Fatty acids and stable isotopes (delta C-13, delta N-15) in southern right whale Eubalaena australis calves in relation to age and mortality at Peninsula Valdes, Argentina	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												Baleen whales accumulate fat reserves during the summer to sustain reproduction while fasting in the winter. The southern right whale Eubalaena australis population that calves off Peninsula Valdes, Argentina, experienced high calf mortality events from 2003 to 2013 and poor nutritional states of mothers could be a contributing cause. Previous studies found that the population's reproductive success is influenced by prey availability. Mothers unable to build sufficient fat reserves or feeding on prey with different nutritional value may fail to meet the demands of lactation. Milk is the only source of nutrients and energy for calves at Valdes, so their fatty acids (FAs) and stable isotopes should reflect their mother's diet and feeding-ground locations. Here, we compared FA profiles and C and N stable isotopes of dead calves with those of living calves to evaluate the potential impact of maternal nutrition on calf survival. We found no differences in the FA composition of blubber in dead and living calves, indicating similar maternal diets. Likewise, the isotopic values of living and dead calves imply that their mothers had similar foraging ranges. However, FA composition was greatly affected by calf length, indicating effects of calf age and duration of nursing. These findings suggest that mothers of dead calves did not feed on different diets or feeding grounds compared to mothers of living calves. Future research should further assess the overall health and body condition of the Valdes southern right whale calves.

The results show that H2O2 can reversible inhibit the enzyme (IC50 similar or equal to 0.85 M) and the inhibition is of a mixed type. The kinetics show that k(+0) is much larger than k'(+0), indicating the free enzyme is more susceptible than the enzyme-substrate complex in the H2O2 solution. It is suggested that the presence of the substrate offers marked protection against inhibition by H2O2. Changes of activity and conformation of the enzyme in different concentrations of H2O2 have been compared by measuring the fluorescence spectra and residual activity and show that the change of conformation is more rapidly than that of the residual activity, which implies that the whole conformation of the enzyme changes more rapidly than the conformation of the active centre of the enzyme in the H2O2 solution.

We used carbon and nitrogen stable isotopes (delta C-13 and delta N-15) to quantify the ontogenetic diet shift in E. pacifica in the East Sea (Japan Sea or Sea of Japan). Analyses revealed that delta N-15 values of adults (4.17 +/- 0.10%) were significantly lower than those of juveniles (5.40 +/- 0.30%), reflecting a shift in the diet of E. pacifica adults towards copepod Neocalanus cristatus carcasses, which have been suggested to drift throughout the year in the epipelagic layer of the East Sea. This suggests a trend toward increasing detritivory with maturity, which is not consistent with the results of previous conventional approaches to diet analysis in E. pacifica. Our results should be useful to modelers concerned with quantifying the effects of E. pacifica on energy transfer in marine food chains.																	0171-8630						2011	429						103	109		10.3354/meps09091							WOS:000290682100010

Models of sound scattering by weakly scattering spheres and cylinders of finite length used in this analysis were either taken from other papers or derived and herein adapted for direct comparison over a range of conditions. The models were examined in the very low- (ka much less than 1, kL much less than 1), moderately low-(ka much less than 1, kL greater than or similar to 1), and high-frequency regions (ka much greater than 1, kL much greater than 1), where ii is the acoustic wave number, a is the radius (spherical or cylindrical) of the body, and L is the length of the cylinders (for an elongated body with L/a = 10, "moderately low" corresponds to the range 0.1 less than or similar to ka less than or similar to 0.5). Straight and bent cylinder models were evaluated for broadside incidence, end-on incidence, and averages over various distributions of angle of orientation, The results show that for very low frequencies and for certain distributions of orientation angles at high frequencies, the averaged scattering by cylinders will be similar, if not identical, to the scattering tay spheres of the same volume. Other orientation distributions of the cylinders at high frequencies produce markedly different results. Furthermore, over a wide range of orientation distributions the scattering by spheres is dramatically different from that of the cylinders in the moderately low-frequency region and in the Rayleigh/geometric transition region: (1) the Rayleigh to geometric scattering turning point occurs at different points for the two cases when the bodies are constrained to have the same volume and (2) the functional dependence of the scattering levels upon the volume of the bodies in the moderately low-frequency region is quite often different between the spheres and cylinders because of the fact that the scattering by the cylinders is still directional in this region. The study demonstrates that then are indeed conditions under which different shaped zooplankton of the same volume will yield similar (ensemble average) scattering levels, but generally the shape and orientation distribution of the elongated bodies must be taken into account for accurate predictions.

Biology and life cycles of pelagic tunicates in the Lazarev Sea, Southern Ocean	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY												Four grid surveys were carried out in the top 200 m layer of the Lazarev Sea during fall 2004, summer 2005-06, winter 2006 and summer 2007-08 onboard the R.V. Polarstern as a part of the German SO-GLOBEC. The distribution, abundance and biology of two species of salps, Salpa thompsoni and Ihlea racovitzai, were investigated. With the exception of fall 2004, I. racovitzai dominated the salp community although being represented by low densities (<20 ind. 1000 m(-3)). S. thompsoni was scarce during the summers of 2005-06 and 2007-08 and almost absent from the region during winter 2006. Nevertheless, it was modestly numerous during fall 2004 reaching densities of up to 33 ind. 1000 m(-3) in the southwestern stations of the grid. The data on the seasonal population structure and life cycle off. racovitzai showed that this species followed the generalized pattern typical of S. thompsoni, i.e. sexual/asexual reproduction and spawning during fall. I. racovitzai densities were the lowest during summer, increased during fall and peaked in during winter. Numerous offspring were produced by I. racovitzai during fall, just before the area became ice-covered. Conversely, S. thompsoni was not able to complete its life cycle in the Lazarev Sea, with a high occurrence of stage X (unfertilized) aggregates present. Highest S. thompsoni densities in summer and fall, and its disappearance in winter are indicative of a population of the expatriate origin that is sustained by advection.

J	Cleary, AC; Durbin, EG; Rynearson, TA; Bailey, J				Cleary, Alison C.; Durbin, Edward G.; Rynearson, Tatiana A.; Bailey, Jennifer			Feeding by Pseudocalanus copepods in the Bering Sea: Trophic linkages and a potential mechanism of niche partitioning	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY												Pseudocalanus copepods are small, abundant zooplankton in the Bering Sea ecosystem that play an important role in transferring primary production to fish and other higher trophic-level predators. Four morphologically cryptic species, the primarily arctic Pseudocalanus minutus and Pseudocalanus acuspes, and the more temperate Pseudocalanus newmani and Pseudocalanus mimus, are found within the Bering Sea. Pseudocalanus are generally considered phytoplanktivores. However, their feeding is poorly known, despite their importance to the ecosystem. In situ feeding by the three most abundant Pseudocalanus congeners, P. minutus, P. newmani, and P. acuspes, was investigated by sequencing partial 18S rDNA (ribosomal Deoxyribonucleic Acid) of gut contents from 225 individuals sampled from 8 stations across the Bering Sea in May and June of 2010. The 28,456 prey 18S rDNA sequences obtained clustered into 138 distinct prey items with a 97% similarity cut-off, and included diatoms, dinoflagellates, microzooplankton, mesozooplankton, and vascular plants. Pseudocalanus diets reflected variations in the environment, with phytoplankton sequences relatively more abundant in copepods from stations with higher water column chlorophyll a concentrations. Feeding differences were observed between species. P. acuspes diet contained relatively more heterotrophic dinoflagellate sequences, and was significantly different from that of P. minutus and P. newmani, both of which contained relatively more diatom sequences, and between which no significant difference was observed. Feeding differences between the two primarily arctic species may be a mechanism of niche partitioning between these spatially co-located congeners and may have implications for the effects of climate change on the success of these abundant zooplankters and their many predators in this ecosystem.

Proteolytic activity and protease classes in the zooplankton species Calanus finmarchicus	COMPARATIVE BIOCHEMISTRY AND PHYSIOLOGY B-BIOCHEMISTRY & MOLECULAR BIOLOGY												The temperature optimum for the general proteolytic activity in the crude extract of Calanusfinmarchicus was 50 degrees C and the pH optimum was found to be 7. The use of specific protease inhibitors resulted in the identification of at least three protease classes in the. crude extract of C. finmarchicus. Those classes were serine, metallo and aspartic proteases. The serine and metallo proteases were found to be dominant under neutral to alkaline conditions and the aspartic proteases were dominant under acidic conditions. The cysteine proteases, if at all present, did not seem to be active or present in any substantial amount. The data presented points towards controlling and preserving the protein content in fresh C. finmarchicus. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

J	Logerwell, EA; Hewitt, RP; Demer, DA				Logerwell, EA; Hewitt, RP; Demer, DA			Scale-dependent spatial variance patterns and correlations of seabirds and prey in the southeastern Bering Sea as revealed by spectral analysis	ECOGRAPHY												Uni-and bivariate spectral analyses of the spatial distribution of thick-billed murres Uria lomvia and acoustic estimates or prey biomass in the southeastern Bering Sea were used to examine the spatial variance patterns of a predator and its prey at multiple spatial scales. Power, phase and coherency spectra from individual transects. as well as those averaged over all transects, were examined. The average spectra; representing atemporal scale of months, showed that murres and prey had similar spatial variance patterns and were positively correlated over the range of spatial scales studied. The individual spectra. representing a temporal scale of hours, showed several patterns that were not evident in the average spectre. In particular, the transect-level analyses showed that the correlation between murres and prey was poor at spatial scales where prey variance was relatively low. This result suggests a new hypothesis to explain poor small-scale correlations between consumers and resources: resource distribution is relatively uniform at small scales resulting in only a slight increase in foraging return For consumers showing an aggregative response at these scales. The differences among spatial scales and between the average and individual spectra illustrate how ecological patterns can vary with temporal and spatial scale.																	0906-7590	1600-0587				APR	1998	21	2					212	223		10.1111/j.1600-0587.1998.tb00674.x							WOS:000073403700012						
J	STUART, V				STUART, V			FECUNDITY OF EUPHAUSIA-LUCENS (HANSEN) - LABORATORY EVIDENCE FOR MULTIPLE BROODS	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY												There has been much controversy in the past as to how many broods euphausiids are capable of producing per season. Several authors have suggested that multiple broods are possible, although this has not been demonstrated in the laboratory. In the present study, two Euphausia lucens females were shown to spawn continuously over a period of at least 2.5 months. The euphausiids produced almost-equal-to 33-40 broods during this period, representing 134-192% of their body carbon. Daily egg production rates varied from 0 to 86 eggs, representing a mean of 3-4% of their body carbon d-1. Egg production rates were often severely depressed during moulting, and were also somewhat lower during experimental manipulation (changing food conditions). The results suggest that egg production by E. lucens, and perhaps by many other euphausiid species, are considerably higher than was previously thought.																	0022-0981						1992	160	2					221	228		10.1016/0022-0981(92)90239-7							WOS:A1992JV26800005

The values of g ranged from 0.997 to 1.009 in N. cristatus and from 0.995 to 1.009 in N. plumchrus. There were no correlations between prosome length (PL) and g. The values of h ranged from 1.006 to 1.021 in N. cristatus and from 1.013 to 1.025 in N. plumchrus and varied with changes in temperature. TS was estimated with the theoretical sound scattering model using the values of g and h based on the temperature, salinity, and depth of the location where the specimens were collected. Regressions of the tilt-averaged TS versus PL were obtained at 38, 120, and 200 kHz. The averaged TS of N. cristatus and N. plumchrus at 120 kHz, which is widely used as a high frequency, ranged from -110.0 to -103.1 dB and from -121.4 to -109.7 dB, respectively. There was a positive correlation between frequency and averaged TS: the higher the frequency, the higher the value of averaged TS. The TS at 120 and 38 kHz varied from 14.8 to 16.4 dB in N. cristatus and from 17.9 to 18.7 dB in N. plumchrus, respectively; that at 200 and 120 kHz varied from 2.9 to 5.5 dB in N. cristatus and from 5.3 to 6.5 dB in N. plumchrus, respectively.

Multiscale methods for data on graphs and irregular multidimensional situations	JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY												For regularly spaced one-dimensional data, wavelet shrinkage has proven to be a compelling method for non-parametric function estimation. We create three new multiscale methods that provide wavelet-like transforms both for data arising on graphs and for irregularly spaced spatial data in more than one dimension. The concept of scale still exists within these transforms, but as a continuous quantity rather than dyadic levels. Further, we adapt recent empirical Bayesian shrinkage techniques to enable us to perform multiscale shrinkage for function estimation both on graphs and for irregular spatial data. We demonstrate that our methods perform very well when compared with several other methods for spatial regression for both real and simulated data. Although we concentrate on multiscale shrinkage (regression) we present our new 'wavelet transforms' as generic tools intended to be the basis of methods that might benefit from a multiscale representation of data either on graphs or for irregular spatial data.

Evidence of lipofuscin accumulation in the deep-water red shrimp Aristaeomorpha foliacea (Risso, 1827)	MEDITERRANEAN MARINE SCIENCE												Lipofuscin, a non-degradable, degenerative fluorescent pigment which accumulates in post-mitotic cells represents a promising method for ageing marine crustaceans. The presence and accumulation of lipofuscin has been studied in the deep-water red shrimp Aristaeomorpha foliacea (Risso, 1827) to assess its use as a tool for ageing larger (i.e., older) specimens and thus improve knowledge of the growth and longevity of this species. Specimens, gathered during experimental trawl surveys carried out in the Strait of Sicily (Mediterranean Sea), were stored directly on-board in 10% buffered formaldehyde solution; their brain was thereafter removed, prepared with various current histological techniques and examined with a binocular microscope. Thin sections of the olfactory lobe cell mass were also analyzed using fluorescence microscopy, and tire lipofuscin concentration was measured through image analysis. Various indices were computed for each individual by pooling data from many images: number and coverage of the lipofuscin granules per unit area, and mean individual area of the granules. Lipofuscin was detected in all specimens investigated with characteristics (grain typology and dimension) strictly resembling those already described in other crustacean species. The present preliminary results encourage further studies to develop and validate a methodology based on the use of lipofuscin for improving the relative ageing of large A. foliacea shrimps.

J	Fregin, T; Wiese, K				Fregin, T; Wiese, K			The photophores of Meganyctiphanes norvegica (M. Sars) (Euphausiacea): mode of operation	HELGOLAND MARINE RESEARCH												The photophores of Meganyctiphanes were investigated with regard to the control of light production and with respect to their role in a hitherto unknown communication system using light flashes which became evident from observation of specialised signalling behaviour. To that purpose the light production was recorded during presentation of a range of stimuli delivered to the intact, tethered shrimp. Stimuli used were changes in ambient light, water turbulence, simulated predator approach and light flashes, as well as electric shocks and serotonin injections. Strong negative light gradients, exaggerating the natural sunset signal, reliably elicited light production, the peak of which lasted on average 2 min. In the late phase of this light production, low frequency water oscillations and turbulent flow (assumed intraspecific communication signals at close range) elicited transient increases in light production. Artificial light flashes presented to a group of shrimp evoked a signalling behaviour in which the animal points the light of its photophore beamers (positioned at the ventral side and normally directed downwards) for a fraction of a second at observers within the same depth level. The responses produced by the signalling behaviour indicate a fixed delay with respect to the triggering flash. Electric stimulation of the ventral nerve cord via implanted electrodes resulted in a strong light production with a latency of 160 ms. Injection of serotonin, resulting in haemolymph concentrations of 10(-5) M and higher, initiated increasingly strong and increasingly long-lasting continuous light production. Implications for the control of the photophores are discussed.																	1438-387X	1438-3888				JUN	2002	56	2					112	124		10.1007/s10152-002-0104-4							WOS:000176838700004						
J	Temperoni, B; Massa, A; Vinas, MD				Temperoni, Brenda; Massa, Agueda; Delia Vinas, Maria			Fatty acids composition as an indicator of food intake in Merluccius hubbsi larvae	JOURNAL OF THE MARINE BIOLOGICAL ASSOCIATION OF THE UNITED KINGDOM												Fatty acids (FA) analysis is a well-established approach for qualitatively studying feeding preferences. In the Argentinean Continental Shelf, Argentine hake Merluccius hubbsi supports the major demersal finfish fishery. The Patagonian stock of the species spawns and nurses in austral summer in the north Patagonian shelf (NPS, 43 degrees-45 degrees 30 ' S). Previous studies about larval feeding in the NPS have solely focused on gut contents, indicating selectivity upon calanoid copepods. Hence, our main objective was to apply the FA approach to confirm and/or broaden M. hubbsi larval food selection. Hake larvae and copepod FA profiles overlapped significantly, dominated by the saturated FA 16:0, the monounsaturated FAs 18:1n-9 and 22:1n-9, and the polyunsaturated FA 22:6n-3. Moreover, identified markers typical of bacteria (15:0, 17:0) and dinoflagellates (18:4n-3, 22:6n-3) suggest a microbial input at the base of the NPS food web, with the latter probably acting as an intermediate step between bacteria and hake larvae. Possible direct predation upon protozoans by larvae is postulated, broadening the known trophic spectrum derived from classical diet analyses. The FA approach allowed us to clarify feeding preferences in the NPS, with data being relevant in the context of hake recruitment studies.																	0025-3154	1469-7769				JUN	2019	99	4					983	990		10.1017/S002531541800070X							WOS:000474835600030

Previous seasonally restricted studies have described the deep acoustic scattering layers of the Irminger Sea as 'ubiquitous'. They have shown that the intensity of the acoustic backscatter varies across the region, and so, by implication, the potential predation pressure on C.. nmarchicus also varies spatially. This paper reports observations of the distribution of epipelagic ( 0 - 200 m) and meso-pelagic ( 200 - 1,000 m) acoustic backscatter in the Irminger Sea, made using a scientific echosounder operating at 38 kHz during four seasonal ( winter, spring and summer) cruises. Our study demonstrates that the intensity of the backscatter varies seasonally in regionally distinct ways across the Irminger Sea. The mean acoustic backscatter, both in the upper 800 m and upper 200 m of the water column, varied significantly between the northern, central and southern areas of the central basin ('open ocean'), and within each area between the Greenland shelf slope, open ocean and Mid-Atlantic Ridge subregions. Different patterns of seasonal change in the acoustic backscatter between the upper 800 m and upper 200 m were also seen, indicating both persistent differences in the underlying amount of backscatter in each area, and varying patterns of seasonal increase in the near surface backscatter in the different areas and subregions. These observations could be related to the different oceanographic regimes encountered in each location, and are discussed in terms of their implications for potential predation pressure on C. finmarchicus.

NAGase from prawn (Penaeus vannamei) is involved in digestion and molting processes. The investigation of enzymatic properties, functional groups and catalytic mechanism is an essential mission to its commercial application. Bromacetic acid (BrAc) is a specific modifier for the histidine residue in specific condition. In this paper, the effect of BrAc on prawn NAGase activity for the hydrolysis of pNP-NAG has been investigated. The results showed that BrAc can reversibly and non-competitively inhibit the enzyme activity at appropriate concentrations and the value of IC50 was estimated to be 17.05 +/- 0.65 mM. The inhibition kinetics of the enzyme by BrAc has been studied using the kinetic method of the substrate reaction. And the inhibition model was set up and the microscopic rate constants for the reaction of the inhibitor with free enzyme and the enzyme-substrate complexes were determined for inactivation and reactivation. The rate constant of the forward inactivation (k(+0)), which is 1.25 x 10(-3) s(-1), is about eight times as much as that of the reverse reactivation (k(-0)), which is 1.64 x 10(-4) s(-1). Therefore, when the BrAc concentration is sufficiently large, the enzyme is completely inactivated. (c) 2007 Published by Elsevier B.V.

J	Pinaud, D; Weimerskirch, H				Pinaud, D; Weimerskirch, H			Scale-dependent habitat use in a long-ranging central place predator	JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY												1. It is predicted that the movements of foraging animals are adjusted to the hierarchical spatial distribution of resources in the environment, and that decisions to modify movement in response to heterogeneous resource distribution are scale-dependent. Thus, controlling for spatial scales of interaction with environment is critical for a better understanding of habitat selection, which is likely to follow scale-dependent processes. 2. Here we study the scales of interactions and habitat selection in a long-ranging marine predator foraging from a central place, the yellow-nosed albatross. We use first-passage time analysis to identify the scales of interaction with environmental variables and compositional analysis to study habitat selection. 3. Of 26 birds, 22 adopted an area restricted search (ARS) at a scale of 130 +/- 85 km, and 11 of these 22 birds adopted a second, nested ARS scale at 34 +/- 20 km. Habitat use differed according to the spatial scale considered. At the oceanic basin macro-scale, birds foraged in pelagic, subtropical waters. Birds commuted to the ARS zones after a c. 1500-km trip to reach predictable turbulence zones from Agulhas return current, where primary productivity was enhanced at large scale. At a smaller, meso-scale, birds increased their search effort according to sea surface height anomalies (SSHa) and chlorophyll-a concentrations (Chl-a), indicating association with productive cyclonic eddies. 4. Among birds, differences in search pattern were noted: 11 birds concentrated their search effort directly at a small scale of 77 +/- 22 km, avoiding anticyclonic eddies. The 11 other birds showed two scales of ARS pattern: (i) first at 180 +/- 90 km with a preference for high Chl-a concentrations but unrelated to SSHa; and (ii) secondly at a nested scale at 34 +/- 20 km related exclusively to SSHa where prey patches were expected to be distributed at this scale. This second group of birds appeared to be less efficient, spending more time at sea for the same mass gain than the first group. 5. Our study is the first to demonstrate scale-dependent adjustments, with interindividual variability, in relation to environmental features for predators with a central-place constraint.

It is in the composition of the chitinases and cooperates with endo-chitinase and exo-chitinase to disintegrate chitin into N-acetylglucosamine. In this work, the effects of dioxane on the enzyme activity for the hydrolysis of p-nitrophenyl-N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminide from the prawn (Penaeus vannamei) have been studied. The results show that appropriate concentrations of dioxane can lead to reversible inactivation of the enzyme, and the IC50 is estimated to be 1.1 M. The kinetics of inactivation of NAGase in the appropriate concentrations of dioxane solution has been studied using the kinetic method of the substrate reaction. The rate constants of inactivation have been determined. The results show that the free enzyme molecule is more fragile than the enzyme-substrate complex in the dioxane solution. It is suggested that the presence of the substrate offers marked protection of this enzyme against inactivation by dioxane.																	0006-2979	1608-3040				DEC	2004	69	12					1365	1371		10.1007/s10541-005-0082-7							WOS:000226698900007	15627392					
J	Gomez-Gutierrez, J; Robinson, CJ				Gomez-Gutierrez, J; Robinson, CJ			Embryonic, early larval development time, hatching mechanism and interbrood period of the sac-spawning euphausiid Nyctiphanes simplex Hansen	JOURNAL OF PLANKTON RESEARCH												Females of the sac-spawning euphausiid Nyctiphanes simplex Hansen were incubated under shipboard laboratory conditions to observe the embryonic and larval development time and hatching mechanism. Females ready to spawn have a pale pink ovary that extends from the back of the stomach to the first abdominal segment, filling most of the haemocoel. This species usually behaves as a total spawner (produces one batch of oocytes per cycle of the ovary) leaving an 'empty' space in the cephalothorax where the spent ovary is located. After spawning, the young oocytes mature and turn pale pink. The eggs do not have a measurable perivitelline space (PVS) in any of the embryonic stages (6.6 x magnification). The embryos hatch as nauplius (80-91 h after spawning, 16 degrees C +/- 1 degrees C). They further develop into pseudometanauplii (PMN, 90-105 h after spawning) and metanauplii (MN, 92-140 h after spawning) inside the ovigerous sac. The nauplius breaks the thin and fragile chorion by increasing the volume of the body and by using the first and second antennae. We call this an 'expansion' hatching mechanism, the fifth distinct hatching mechanism observed so far among euphausiids. N. simplex larvae escape from the ovigerous sac late in the MN stage (5 days after spawning), just a few hours before molting into calyptopis 1 (C1) (0.5-4 h). This delayed release extends protection by the female, likely decreasing the risk of predation or early cannibalism. Additionally, this may save energy by not swimming independently increasing the time of not return if the calyptopis does not find favorable feeding conditions. Females are not ready to spawn again until at least two days after the previous batch of embryos leaves the ovigerous sac. The interbrood period (IBP) observed ranged between 7 and 15 days at 16-18 degrees C. This IBP is about one-fourth to half than was previously assumed for this species suggesting a significant underestimation of the fecundity of this species. N. simplex hatching success usually was 100%, except for a few females with all of their embryos dying during embryonic development. Other females either molted before releasing the embryos, or the oocytes were spawned unfertilized (0% hatching success), particularly during winter conditions. Efficient hatching and late free-swimming strategy may partially explain why this species is the most abundant neritic euphausiid in the southern part of the California Current System (CCS) and in the Gulf of California.																	0142-7873	1464-3774				MAR	2005	27	3					279	295		10.1093/plankt/fbi003							WOS:000228079700006

Integration of Scientific Echo Sounders with an Adaptable Autonomous Vehicle to Extend Our Understanding of Animals from the Surface to the Bathypelagic	JOURNAL OF ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC TECHNOLOGY												Acoustic echo sounders designed to map and discriminate organisms in the water column have primarily been deployed on ships. Because of acoustic attenuation of higher frequencies used to detect and discriminate micronekton and nekton, this has effectively restricted the range of this information to the upper water column. In an effort to overcome these range limitations by reducing the distance between the transducer and the targets of interest, dual-frequency (38 and 120 kHz) split-beam echo sounders were integrated into a Remote Environmental Monitoring Units (REMUS) 600 autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV), effectively doubling the range of quantitative acoustic data into the mesopelagic zone (600-1200 m). Data from the first set of missions in a range of conditions revealed that the AUV provided a stable platform for the echo sounders and improved vertical and horizontal positional accuracy over echo sounders towed by ships. In comparison to hull-mounted echo sounders, elimination of ship noise and surface bubbles provided a 17- and 19-dBW decrease in the noise floor for the 38- and 120-kHz echo sounders, respectively, effectively increasing the sampling range by 30%-40%. The extended depth range also increased the resolution of the acoustic horizontal footprint from 37-40 to 0.6-3.7 m, enabling discrimination of individual targets at depth. Also developed here is novel onboard echo sounder data processing and autonomy to allow sampling not feasible in a surface ship or towed configuration. Taken together, these data demonstrate an effective new tool for examining the biology of animals in the mesopelagic zone (600-1200 m) in ways previously only possible in the upper ocean.																	0739-0572	1520-0426				NOV	2015	32	11					2173	2186		10.1175/JTECH-D-15-0035.1							WOS:000365603300014

These measurements were compared with the theoretical predictions by the Distorted-Wave Born Approximation-based deformed-cylinder model (DWBA model). The measurements agreed with the predictions. Dorsal-aspect TSs as a function of the incident angle of the ensonified wave were also predicted by taking the curvature of the body in their swimming condition into account. The relationship between the reduced maximum TS (TScm, max) in dorsal aspect by the DWBA model and the total length to wavelength ratio (TL/lambda) was expressed by TScm, max = 36.5 log TL/lambda-91.4.

Total protease activity was 98.5 +/- 4.3 E-366 min(-1) ml(-1). Trypsin and chymotrypsin activities amounted to 14.7 +/- 1.5 U ml(-1) and 197 59 U ml(-1), respectively. The maximum activity of total protease appeared at pH 5-7, that of trypsin at pH 7-9, and that of chymotrypsin at pH 6.5-7. Trypsin and chymotrypsin activities were slightly activated by Ca+, but were drastically reduced by Zn2+. In the presence of 2-propanol, trypsin activity was enhanced 8-fold at 30degreesC. Highest amplification of activity of up to 30-fold, however, appeared below 12degreesC. The effects of ethanol and acetone were less distinct. These caused a 2.5-fold increase of activity. Methanol was the least activating solvent. Activities of all enzymes remained stable for up to 127 days at 5degreesC, keeping up to 70% of the initial activity. When stored at 25degreesC for 120 days, total protease decreased to about 40% and trypsin and chymotrypsin activities kept more than 60% of initial activity. Zymograms showed five major and several minor proteolytic bands with apparent molecular weight of 20-45 kDa. After long-term storage at room temperature, the major bands remained active, while some bands with minor activity disappeared. This proteolytic enzyme preparation from the gastric fluid of crab seems suitable for biotechnological application at neutral pH and in the presence of organic solvents. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

The technological advances required for reliable deployment, mission control, performance, and recovery of AUVs have developed considerably over the past 10 years. Currently, there are several vehicles operating successfully in the offshore industries as well as in the applied and academic oceanographic sciences. This article reviews the application of AUVs to fisheries- and plankton-acoustics research. Specifications of the main AUVs currently in operation are given. Compared to traditional platforms for acoustic instruments, AUVs can sample previously impenetrable environments such as the sea surface, the deep sea, and under-sea ice. Furthermore, AUVs are typically small, quiet, and have the potential to operate at low cost and be unconstrained by the vagaries of weather. Examples of how these traits may be utilized in fisheries-acoustics science are given with reference to previous work in the North Sea and Southern Ocean and to potential future applications. Concurrent advances in multi-beam sonar technology and species identification, using multi-frequency and broadband sonars, will further enhance the utility of AUVs for fisheries acoustics. However, before many of the more prospective applications can be accomplished, advances in power-source technology are required to increase the range of operation. The paper ends by considering developments that may turn AUVs from objects sometimes perceived as science fiction into instruments used routinely to gather scientific facts.

The Saildrones proved to be a suitable platform for measurement of fish backscatter: they produced high-quality measurements at wind speeds of <10 m s(-1). Pollock backscatter measured from the Saildrones was compared to backscatter measured by a noise-reduced research vessel during two "follow-the-leader" comparisons. In a location where pollock were shallowly distributed (30-100 m), there was evidence of depth-dependent avoidance reactions to the ship. This behaviour was not evident in a second comparison, where the fish were primarily deeper than 90 m. Opportunistic comparisons indicate that backscatter where the ship and USVs crossed paths was similar. However, the Saildrones observed higher densities of shallow fish, which is consistent with the diving response inferred in the first follow-the-leader comparison. USVs equipped with echosounders, like all platforms, have inherent strengths (endurance) and limitations (species identification) that should be carefully considered for a given application. USVs can complement traditional ship-based surveys by increasing the spatial and temporal extent of acoustic observations, and their use is likely to become more widespread.

The foraging ecology of Brunnich's guillemots Uria lomvia was studied during the breeding season in south-eastern Svalbard. In the region of Storfjorden there are two large breeding colonies comprising a total of about 540 000 individuals. These birds forage in the western part of Storfjorden and further to the south. Their main prey are polar cod Boreogadus saida, pelagic amphipods Parathemisto spp. and euphausiids Thysanoessa inermis. 2. A ship-based transect survey was used to record bird abundance and the acoustically determined biomass of presumed prey. The five transects were divided into 33 segments, each 8-11 km in length. The resolution of the survey was 150 m, and analyses of correlations between predators and prey were performed at length scales from 150 m to 9 km. We differentiated acoustic signals into aggregated and dispersed categories according to the estimated horizontal distribution of presumed prey. 3. Foraging guillemots were consistently more strongly correlated with the aggregated prey than with dispersed prey over scales ranging from 150 m to 9 km. Correlations were weak at small scales (150 m - 1 km) and increased and stabilized at scales of 23 km. The spatial scale at which we obtained a shift from weak to strong correlations between guillemots and their prey was similar to the scale at which the spatial variances in both guillemot and prey abundance were high. 4. Guillemots showed low correlations with prey at low prey densities. Similarly, correlations between guillemots and prey were low at low bird densities. The data support the hypothesis that the birds associate with prey patches with densities above a certain threshold, and that 'regional' prey abundances affect local use of patches. 5. The numerical aggregative response curves between guillemot and prey density were classified as being neither hyperbolic (type II) or sigmoidal (type III) within the range of prey densities observed in this study. The aggregative response curves were sensitive to spatial scales, which suggest that studies of response curves should be conducted at a range of spatial scales.

The quantity of olfactory-lobe lipofuscin was highly correlated with age (r = 0.96). It was found to be a superior predictor of age compared with the body-size parameters frequently used for this purpose.

Herein, we used five different enzymes to hydrolyze silver carp (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix) muscle protein. Among all treatments, the Neutrase-generated hydrolysate that was purified by a three-step isolation and then was identified using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry resulted in the most potent DPP-IV inhibitory activity and relatively high ACE inhibitory activity. The identified peptide Ala-Ala-Leu-Glu-Gln-Thr-Glu-Arg was the most effective at inhibiting DPP-IV with a half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) value of 647.02 +/- 4.30 mu M. Leu-Leu-Asp-Leu-Gly-Val-Pro showed the highest ACE inhibitory activity with an IC50 value of 329.33 +/- 15.53 mu M. Lys-Ala-Val-Gly-Glu-Pro-Pro-Leu-Phe exhibited the dual inhibition against both DPP-IV and ACE with IC50 values of 1,317.39 +/- 20.93 mu M and 726.01 +/- 8.69 mu M, respectively. Interestingly, it seemed that the majority of peptides which were responsible for inhibiting DPP-IV were different from the ones which caused the inhibition of ACE.

Shoaling preferences in decapod crustacea	ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR												The aggregation behaviour of fish has been extensively studied, but little is known about the shoaling of marine invertebrates. We investigated aggregation behaviour in two species of a decapod crustacean: the brown shrimp, Crangon crangon, a cryptic species that should not rely on aggregations to avoid predation, and the rockpool prawn, Palaemon elegans, a species that lives in areas without shelter and we expect to aggregate. A field survey revealed that prawns had a strongly clumped distribution, whereas shrimps only showed a tendency towards aggregating. However, size segregation was found to be strong in both species. Choice experiments in the laboratory confirmed the field results on the differences in the aggregative tendencies for the two species, as prawns showed a strong preference for shoaling with a group of five conspecifics versus a single conspecific, while shrimps only showed a trend in that direction. Surprisingly, we found no evidence for a size-assortative preference in prawns, suggesting that size segregation in the field might be a consequence of indirect or passive factors rather than individual preferences.

Lipofuscin in a histological section of protocerebral bridge cell mass (PBCM) in the brain was identified by confocal microscopy, and its concentration was quantified by image analysis. Modal analysis of the lipofuscin concentration showed four regularly-spaced modes that could each be regarded as a distinct age group. This implied a constant lipofuscin accumulation in PBCM at a 6.5 x 10(-2)% volume fraction per year; it also implied the existence of individuals that are at least 4 years old. The lipofuscin concentration was found to be a more appropriate index than body length for estimating the age of O. oratoria, because the modal analysis on the body-length histogram failed to detect apparent age groups. This was probably a result of the declining growth rate with age and the individual variations in growth through molting leading to considerable overlap in the size between different age groups. The lipofuscin analysis suggested that fast-growing individuals in each cohort are recruited to the fishery, and most individuals attain the exploitable size between 2 and 3 years of age.																	0919-9268	1444-2906				FEB	2005	71	1					141	150		10.1111/j.1444-2906.2005.00941.x							WOS:000227249900018						
J	Jonsdottir, G; Bjarnason, JB; Gudmundsdottir, A				Jonsdottir, G; Bjarnason, JB; Gudmundsdottir, A			Recombinant cold-adapted trypsin I from Atlantic cod-expression, purification, and identification	PROTEIN EXPRESSION AND PURIFICATION												Atlantic cod trypsin I is a cold-adapted proteolytic enzyme exhibiting approximately 20 times higher catalytic efficiency (k(cat)/K-M) than its mesophilic bovine counterpart for the simple amide substrate BAPNA. In general, cold-adapted proteolytic enzymes are sensitive to autolytic degradation, thermal inactivation as well as molecular aggregation, even at temperatures as low as 18-25 degreesC which may explain the problems observed with their expression, activation, and purification. Prior to the data presented here, there have been no reports in the literature on the expression of psychrophilic or cold-adapted proteolytic enzymes from fish. Nevertheless, numerous cold-adapted proteolytic microbial enzymes have been successfully expressed in bacteria and yeast. This report describes successful expression, activation, and purification of the recombinant cod trypsin I in the His-Patch ThioFusion Escherichia coli expression system. The E. coli pThioHis expression vector used in the study enabled the formation of a fusion protein between a highly soluble fraction of HP-thioredoxin contained in the vector and the N-terminal end of the precursor form of cod trypsin I. The HP-thioredoxin part of the fusion protein binds to a metal-chelating ProBond column, which facilitated its purification. The cod trypsin I part of the purified fusion protein was released by proteolytic cleavage, resulting in concomitant activation of the recombinant enzyme. The recombinant cod trypsin I was purified to homogeneity on a trypsin-specific benzamidine affinity column. The identity of the recombinant enzyme was demonstrated by electrophoresis and chromatography. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc.

These kinds of data are usually positively skewed, have non-normal distributions and are spatially autocorrelated. To analyse such data, we propose a hierarchical model that takes into account the observation process and explicitly deals with spatial autocorrelation. The latent variable is the product of a positive trend representing the non-constant mean of the species distribution and of a stationary positive spatial field representing the variance of the spatial density of the species distribution. Then, the different scales of emergent structures of the distribution of the population in space are modelled from the latent density of the species distribution using multi-scale variogram models. Multi-scale kriging is used to map the spatial patterns previously identified by the multi-scale models. We show how our framework yields robust and precise estimates of the relevant scales both for spatial count data simulated from well-defined models, and in a real case-study based on seabird count data (the common guillemot Uria aalge) provided by large-scale aerial surveys of the Bay of Biscay (France) performed over a winter. Our stochastic simulation study provides guidelines on the expected uncertainties of the scales estimates. Our results indicate that the spatial structure of the common guillemot can be modelled as a three-level hierarchical system composed of a very broad-scale pattern (similar to 200 km) with a stable location over time that might be environmentally controlled, a broad-scale pattern (similar to 50 km) with a variable shape and location, that might be related to shifts in prey distribution, and a fine-scale pattern (similar to 10 km) with a rather stable shape and location, that might be controlled by behavioural processes. Our framework enables the development of robust, scale-dependent hypotheses regarding the potential ecological processes that control species distributions.				chadoeuf, joel/O-2583-2013	Bellier, Edwige/0000-0002-1184-0668; Monestiez, Pascal/0000-0001-5851-2699												0906-7590	1600-0587				SEP	2012	35	9					839	854		10.1111/j.1600-0587.2011.06456.x							WOS:000305941800008

Growth characteristics, including intermolt period (IP), molt increment (MI) in size and mass, and tissue allocation in juvenile, male, and female shrimp, were evaluated at 2, 5, and 8A degrees C, the temperature range where this species is generally found in the Northwest Atlantic. Significant variations in growth were associated with temperature and shrimp size. IP (days) increased significantly with shrimp size and was inversely related to temperature. Size (cephalothorax length in mm) and temperature effects were best described by IP = 10((0.67 log(CL) - 0.06 T -) (1.34)). The pronounced effect of temperature on IP while MIS changed little indicated that the main influence of temperature on growth rate of P. borealis was through IP. Specific growth rate (SGR(S)) decreased rapidly with size to near zero values in females. Overall, juveniles were much more sensitive to temperature variations than adults, suggesting that temperatures encountered during the juvenile stage will largely influence the growth trajectory of the population.

The labrum appears to play a major role in the first step of the digestive process. It is involved in both mechanical and chemical breakdown of the food. Structural, ultrastructural and. cytochemical data on the labrum reveal similarities with the labrum of the primitive Mysidacea Lophogaster typicus (Lophogastrida). The foregut acts predominantly in triturating the food and in separating fine particles and fluids from coarse material by filters. Morphological features indicate that the foregut of euphausiids might have evolved from the same ancestral morphological type as the mysidaceans. i.e. close to Gnathophausia gracilis (Lophogastrida). The midgut exhibits typical ultrastructural features known in the Malacostraca, i.e. an epithelium composed of a single cell type which is implicated in absorption and production of peritrophic membranes. The midgut gland exhibits F-cells, considered to secrete enzymes in Decapoda, and not truly evidenced in the Mysidacea. Therefore, this study Suggests that the digestive system of Euphausiacea has both primitive features evidenced in the lower Malacostraca (Lophogastrida), and also evolved ones found in the higher Malacostraca (Decapoda).																	0007-9723	2262-3094					2004	45	1					71	82									WOS:000221260400006

Elizabeth; Widdicombe, Stephen; Hauton, Chris; Bruggeman, Jorn			Adapting the dynamic energy budget (DEB) approach to include non-continuous growth (moulting) and provide better predictions of biological performance in crustaceans	ICES JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE												Dynamic energy budget (DEB) theory offers a comprehensive framework for understanding the overall physiological performance (growth, development, respiration, reproduction, etc.) of an organism over the course of its life cycle. We present here a simplified DEB model for the swimming crab Liocarcinus depurator. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first to be presented for this species. Most applications of the standard DEB model assume continuous growth in all size metrics (length, wet mass, carbon content) of the modelled species. However, in crustaceans growth, measured as an increase of carapace length/width, occurs periodically via moult. To account for this, we have extended the model to track the continuous increase in carbon mass as well as the episodic increase in physical size. Model predictions were consistent with the patterns in the observed data, predicting both the moult increment and the intermoult period of an individual. In addition to presenting the model itself, we also make recommendations for further development, and evaluate the potential applications of such a model, both at the individual level (e.g. aquaculture) and as a potential tool for population level dynamics (e.g. fisheries stock assessment).

Sibships (siblings from the same mother) were raised on different food items collected from the field and cultured in the laboratory. A sibship was divided at the calyptopis stage and 50% of the siblings were fed one of three experimental diets (Thalassiosira, Heterocapsa, or Phaeocystis); the balance of the siblings were fed a control diet of Tetraselmis chuii and Artemia larvae. The growth rate of siblings was not altered by the different diets. Siblings developed asynchronously, however, from egg to adult. Some animals were always at a more advanced developmental phase and by day 100, up to 25% larger than their siblings (p<0.001). A possible implication of this result is that the larval growth of N. australis is strongly influenced by genotype. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

Random-systematic line-transect surveys of marine mammals were conducted monthly from August to November 1996, and from May to November 1997-99. CTDs and zooplankton net tows were conducted opportunistically, and at 10 predetermined locations. Hydroacoustic backscatter was measured continuously while underway to estimate prevalence of zooplankton, with emphasis on euphausiids, a key trophic link between primary production and higher trophic level consumers. The occurrences of several of the California Current's most common cetaceans varied among years. The assemblage of odontocetes became more diverse during the El Nino with a temporary influx of warm-water species. Densities of cold-temperate Dall's porpoise, Phocoenoides dalli, were greatest before the onset of El Nino, whereas warm-temperate common dolphins, Delphinus spp., were present only during the warm-water period associated with El Nino. Rorqual densities decreased in August 1997 as euphausiid backscatter was reduced. In 1998, as euphausiid backscatter slowly increased, rorqual densities increased sharply to the greatest observed values. Euphausiid backscatter further increased in 1999, whereas rorqual densities were similar to those observed during 1998. We hypothesize that a dramatic reduction in zooplankton biomass offshore during El Nino 1997-98 led to the concentration of rorquals in the remaining productive coastal upwelling areas, including Monterey Bay.

Where prey distributions are unpredictable and ephemeral, seabirds may gain up-to-date information by monitoring the direction of birds returning to the colony or by monitoring the foraging behavior of other birds through local enhancement. However, search strategies based on social information may require high population densities, raising concerns about the potential loss of information in declining populations. Our objectives were to explore the mechanisms that underpin effective search strategies based on social information under a range of population densities and different foraging conditions. Testing relevant hypotheses through field observation is challenging because of limitations in the ability to manipulate population densities and foraging conditions. We therefore developed a spatially explicit individual-based foraging model, informed by data on the movement and foraging patterns of seabirds foraging on pelagic prey, and used model simulations to investigate the mechanisms underpinning search strategies. Orientation of outbound headings in line with returning birds enables departing birds to avoid areas without prey even at relatively low population densities. The mechanisms underpinning local enhancement are more effective as population densities increase and may be facilitated by other mechanisms that concentrate individuals in profitable areas. For seabirds and other central place foragers foraging on unpredictable and ephemeral food resources, information is especially valuable when resources are spatially concentrated and may play an important role in mitigating poor foraging conditions.

The protective effects of osmolytes on the thermal denaturation and aggregation of arginine kinase from E. superba (ESAK) was investigated. When the concentration of glycine, proline and glycerol increased, the relative activation was significantly enhanced, while the aggregation of ESAK during thermal denaturation was decreased. Spectrofluorometry results showed that the presence of these three osmolytes significantly decreased the tertiary structural changes of ESAK and that thermal denaturation directly induced ESAK aggregation. The results demonstrated that glycine, proline and glycerol not only prevented ESAK from inactivation and unfolding but also inhibited aggregation by stabilizing the ESAK conformation. We measured the ORF gene sequence of ESAK by RACE, and built the 3D structure of ESAK and osmolytes by homology models. The results showed that the docking energy was relatively low and that the clustering groups were spread to the surface of ESAK, indicating that osmolytes directly protect the surface of the protein. Our study provides important insight into the protective effects of osmolytes on ESAK folding. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Ritz, DA				Ritz, David A.			Gut residence time in pelagic crustaceans	JOURNAL OF THE MARINE BIOLOGICAL ASSOCIATION OF THE UNITED KINGDOM												Gut residence time (GRT) is often reported to be extremely variable among crustaceans. In this study, GRT was measured in tethered mysids that were fed continuously, and appearance of the first faecal pellet was found to be quite consistent averaging 1.6 h. There was no significant difference between GRT in those mysids field singly and those accompanied by free-swimming conspecifics, even though previous studies have shown metabolic benefits in social behaviour. Gut residence time data from a range of pelagic crustaceans feeding continuously showed a clear linear relationship with size. It appears that, when feeding ceases and crustaceans are allowed to clear their guts in filtered water, GRT can be very long and variable. However, when feeding is continuous, GRT can be relatively short and cosistent.																	0025-3154					FEB	2008	88	1					65	67		10.1017/S0025315408000118							WOS:000254298600007

N. marionis is thought to have an opportunistic feeding mode. Prey composition varied considerably between the years and sites investigated. Overall, benthic (mainly hydrozoans and bottom-dwelling polychaetes) and, at times, pelagic (largely euphausiids and copepods) prey items dominated in the stomachs of N. marionis both by occurrence and by volume. Generally, pelagic prey contributed more to the diets of smaller shrimps, while benthic prey was a more important component in the guts of larger specimens. Wet, dry and ash-free dry weight were determined for specimens used in respiration experiments. The respiration rates of N. marionis females with carapace length 6.6-11.1 mm ranged from 80 to 250 mu l O-2 individual(-1) . h(-1), or from 0.588 to 2.756 mu l O-2 . mg(-1) dry weight h(-1). Regression analyses showed highly significant correlations between oxygen consumption and carapace length for N. marionis. Daily ingestion rates estimated using an in situ gut content analysis technique (4.4% of body dry weight) and an energy budget approach (average 4.7% of body dry weight, range 2.0-7.5%) showed good agreement with each other.

Cold Adaptation, Ca2+ Dependency and Autolytic Stability Are Related Features in a Highly Active Cold-Adapted Trypsin Resistant to Autoproteolysis Engineered for Biotechnological Applications	PLOS ONE												Pig trypsin is routinely used as a biotechnological tool, due to its high specificity and ability to be stored as an inactive stable zymogen. However, it is not an optimum enzyme for conditions found in wound debriding for medical uses and trypsinization processes for protein analysis and animal cell culturing, where low Ca2+ dependency, high activity in mild conditions and easy inactivation are crucial. We isolated and thermodynamically characterized a highly active cold-adapted trypsin for medical and laboratory use that is four times more active than pig trypsin at 10 degrees C and at least 50% more active than pig trypsin up to 50 degrees C. Contrary to pig trypsin, this enzyme has a broad optimum pH between 7 and 10 and is very insensitive to Ca2+ concentration. The enzyme is only distantly related to previously described cryophilic trypsins. We built and studied molecular structure models of this trypsin and performed molecular dynamic calculations. Key residues and structures associated with calcium dependency and cryophilicity were identified. Experiments indicated that the protein is unstable and susceptible to autoproteolysis. Correlating experimental results and structural predictions, we designed mutations to improve the resistance to autoproteolysis and conserve activity for longer periods after activation. One single mutation provided around 25 times more proteolytic stability. Due to its cryophilic nature, this trypsin is easily inactivated by mild denaturation conditions, which is ideal for controlled proteolysis processes without requiring inhibitors or dilution. We clearly show that cold adaptation, Ca2+ dependency and autolytic stability in trypsins are related phenomena that are linked to shared structural features and evolve in a concerted fashion. Hence, both structurally and evolutionarily they cannot be interpreted and studied separately as previously done.

Two-Million-Liter Tank Expands the Boundaries of Marine Technology Innovation: National Resource Available for Advancing Marine Science	MARINE TECHNOLOGY SOCIETY JOURNAL												With one small move across a street, NOAA Fisheries, our nation's steward of marine ecosystems, made a giant leap into the future of ocean science and technology development. The new Southwest Fisheries Science Center facility in La Jolla, California, houses dozens of interdisciplinary research and engineering groups and features a world-class Ocean Technology Development Tank that expands the possibilities for advancing marine industry and science. This 20 x 10 x 10-meter, two-million-liter, freshwater or seawater Tech Tank is clear, quiet, and large enough to calibrate and test a wide variety of sensitive instruments with minimal boundary effects. The tank's temperature, salinity, and circulation can be made to mimic the broad range of water conditions encountered in the field, its water conditioning system greatly mitigates microbubbles and turbidity, and it can accommodate live marine animals. This unique combination of features opens doors to efficient engineering and scientific experimentation. The Tech Tank, supported by scientists and engineers and co-located with other state-of-the-art laboratory facilities, is a unique national resource for marine research and development and a catalyst for government, academic, and industry partnerships. The broad range of new possibilities is exemplified by multiple recent collaborative developments of acoustic and optical sensors and sensor platforms that effectively expand the boundaries of oceanic sampling, particularly near the sea surface, seabed, and seashore, to more efficiently and accurately monitor large marine ecosystems.

Neutral lipids were present in greater amounts than polar lipids in all species. Triacylglycerols were major neutral lipids in A. glacialis, G. wilkitzkii and O. nanseni; triacylglycerols and wax esters were present in similar amounts in O. glacialis; higher levels of wax esters than triacylglycerols occurred in P. libellula; wax esters greatly exceeded triacylglycerols in C. hyperboreus, the opposite being true for B. saida. Diatom fatty acid markers were prominent in the triacylglycerols of G. wilkitzkii, O. nanseni, O. glacialis and, particularly, of A. glacialis; 20:1(n-9) and 22:1(n-11) moieties were abundant in wax esters of G. wilkitzkii, O. nanseni, O. glacialis, P. libellula and C. hyperboreus, and in triacylglycerols of B. saida. We deduce that A. glacialis feeds mainly on ice algae and phytodetritus, G. wilkitzkii and the Onismus spp. feed on calanoid copepods as well as ice algae, whereas P. libellula and especially B. saida feed extensively on calanoid copepods.

Strategy for the identification of key odorants: Application to shrimp aroma	JOURNAL OF CHROMATOGRAPHY A												The GC-SNIF technique was used to obtain the olfactograms of shrimps, and their impact odorants were identified by MS hyphenated to the GC/olfactometric system and by comprehensive two-dimensional GC hyphenated to a time-of-flight MS. Confirming these identifications by their linear retention indices required application of a new strategy to compare retention indices between both instruments and with the in-house database. The aldehydes were confirmed by using their pentafluorophenylhydrazone derivatives, and 2-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl pyrazine had to be resolved from co-eluting compounds and then identified by multidimensional GC hyphenated to an MS and a sniff port. In both shrimp products, the most important odorants were trimethylamine. 2-acetyl-1-pyrroline, and 2-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl pyrazine, together with common carbonyl compounds. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

J	Metillo, EB; Ritz, DA				Metillo, EB; Ritz, DA			Differential chemosensory feeding behaviour by three co-occurring mysids (Crustacea, Mysidacea) from southeastern Tasmania	COMPARATIVE BIOCHEMISTRY AND PHYSIOLOGY A-MOLECULAR & INTEGRATIVE PHYSIOLOGY												Three mysid species showed differences in chemosensory feeding as judged from stereotyped food capturing responses to dissolved mixtures of feeding stimulant (either betaine-HCl or glycine) and suppressant (ammonium). The strongest responses were to 50:50 mixtures of both betaine-ammonium and glycine-ammonium solutions. In general, the response curve to the different mixtures tested was bell-shaped. Anisomysis mixta australis only showed the normal curve in response to the glycine-ammonium mixture. The platykurtic curve for Tenagomysis tasmaniae suggests a less optimal response to the betaine-HCl-ammonium solution. Paramesopodopsis rufa reacted more strongly to the betaine-ammonium than to the glycine-ammonium solutions, and more individuals of this species responded to both solutions than the other two species. It is suggested that these contrasting chemosensitivities of the three coexisting mysid species serve as a means of partitioning the feeding niche. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

Here, we investigate interspecific, interannual, and geographic variability in the diets and trophic positions of these copepods using a combination of fatty acids and stable isotopes. To characterize geographic variability in diet, we compare our findings from the Strait of Georgia with similar data from Ocean Station P in the subarctic northeast Pacific. Both fatty acid and stable isotope signatures indicate the existence of three trophic levels, even within the limited size range of these copepods: Neocalanus plumchrus and Calanus marshallae are primarily omnivorous, while Euchaeta elongata is carnivorous and Eucalanus bungii is herbivorous. Fatty acid markers of trophic position (e.g., DHA/EPA, 18:1n-9/18:1n-7) correlate significantly with delta N-15, while markers indicating the proportion of diatoms to flagellates in the diet (e.g., 16PUFA/18PUFA and DHA/EPA) correlate significantly with delta C-13, after the effect of lipid concentration on delta C-13 is accounted for. Despite the general correlation between stable isotopes and fatty acids, the former are not sensitive enough to capture the range of interannual variability observed in the latter, and can only capture substantial shifts in the diet over geographic scales. However, regardless of variability in food quality, the relative trophic positions of these copepods do not change significantly either spatially or temporally.

This method is also useful for quantifying the relative contribution of each frequency to the total acoustic-backscattering when scrutinizing records in large-scale, acoustic Surveys. Echosounder hardware requirements are defined which would permit the ideal extraction of such information. These include calibration, transducer specification, pulse resolution and digital representation of the signals. During this initial Study a special version of the Simrad EK500 multi-frequency, split-beam echosounder and the Bergen Echo Integrator (BEI) post-processing system were used. The echosounder transmitted pulses simultaneously at four frequencies, 18, 38, 120 and 200 kHz and transferred the received signals to the post-processing system in calibrated, raw, digitized format. Methods arc described for echogram manipulation and for the construction of new, synthetic, combined frequency [c(f)] echograms. Examples of extracted scattering information from mixed layers of fish and small scattering-organisms, such as copepods and euphausiids, are shown, and the potential of the method is discussed.

Growth of Euphausia pacifica in the upwelling zone off the Oregon coast	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY												Growth rates and intermolt periods for Euphausia pacifica were determined from individual growth rate (IGR) experiments carried out over a 7-year period (2000-2006) on euphausiids collected off the Oregon Coast. Adult growth rates averaged 0.020 mm total length (TL) day(-1) during the summer upwelling season and 0.011 mm TL day(-1) during the winter downwelling season. Average intermolt period (IMP) was 8 d during upwelling and 11 d during downwelling. Growth rates and IMPs were highly variable, and were not related to surface chl-a concentration or length of the euphausiid. Negative growth occurred at all times of year. Negative growth rates during winter downwelling were most likely related to poor feeding conditions, while negative growth rates during the summer upwelling season were likely a result of the euphausiids investing ingested energy towards reproduction rather than somatic growth. Growth rates from this study using the IGR method were generally lower than E. pacifica growth rates from other studies that used the cohort analysis method. Since negative growth rates are difficult to capture using cohort analysis, we calculated a seasonal growth rate using only the positive values from our experiments to compare with cohort analysis growth rates. These seasonal positive growth rates were 0.08 mm TL d(-1) (2.4 mm month(-1)) for the upwelling season and 0.04 mm TL d(-1) (1.2 mm month(-1)) for the downwelling season, equivalent to weight-specific growth rates of 0.0135 d(-1) (upwelling) and 0.0089 d(-1) (downwelling), and are comparable to rates obtained in other studies using cohort analysis. Highest annual growth rates during upwelling were measured in 2004 (warm) and 2006 (cold), suggesting that E. pacifica is less affected by warm and cool periods than other types of zooplankton, such as copepods.

The eight group Ill trypsins have been characterized from their cDNAs and deduced amino acid sequences but none of the enzymes have been isolated from their native sources. This study describes the successful expression and purification of a recombinant HP-thioredoxin-trypsin Y fusion protein in the His-Patch ThioFusion Escherichia coli expression system and its purification by chromatographic methods. The recombinant form of trypsin Y was previously expressed in Pichia pastoris making it the first biochemically characterized group III trypsin. It has dual substrate specificity towards trypsin and chymotrypsin substrates and demonstrates an increasing activity at temperatures between 2 and 21 degrees C with a complete inactivation at 30 degrees C. The aim of the study was to facilitate further studies of recombinant trypsin Y by finding an expression system yielding higher amounts of the enzyme than possible in our hands in the P. pastoris system. Also, commercial production of trypsin Y will require an efficient and inexpensive expression system like the His-Patch ThioFusion E coli expression system described here as the enzyme is produced in very low amounts in the Atlantic cod.

Samples were collected during two return voyages aboard the MV Benjamin Bowring as part of the Transglobe Expedition (1979-1981). High abundances of surface zooplankton and seabirds were consistently observed within the main frontal systems of the Southern Ocean. Generally, on a mesoscale significant correlations between surface temperature and the distribution of zooplankton or seabirds were observed. On a macroscale, the geographical positions of the zooplankton and seabird communities coincided with specific water masses, The results of this study suggest that appropriate food availability rather than water temperature is important for the determination of seabird distribution. The ecological importance of the recently described frontal zone associated with the northern boundary of the maximum winter expansion of sea ice is confirmed by biological data obtained in this study.

Observations made with a moored 300 kHz acoustic Doppler current profiler indicated that two modes of vertical migration occurred during the study period. During the weeks of continuous illumination, backscatter data indicated that there was no net vertical displacement of the population at any time during the 24-h period, but vertical velocity showed a continuous net downward movement in the surface layers and a net upward movement at depth. We interpreted this as unsynchronized vertical migrations by individuals with upward trajectories that slowed closer to the surface and downward trajectories that were most rapid in their initial phases. Synchronized migrations, seen as an upward and downward movement of scattering layers at dusk and dawn respectively, began once true nighttime resumed toward autumn. It is likely that the relative rate of change in light was used as the proximal cue for synchronized migrations. Concurrent net samples identified Calanus finmarchicus and C. glacialis as the most likely contributors to the unsynchronized migration patterns. The high backscatter of the synchronized scattering layers suggests that they included additional taxa such as the euphausiid Thysanoessa spp., the pteropod Limacina helicina, or the hyperiid amphipod Themisto spp.				Cottier, Finlo/K-6277-2012	Cottier, Finlo/0000-0002-3068-1754												0024-3590	1939-5590				NOV	2006	51	6					2586	2599		10.4319/lo.2006.51.6.2586							WOS:000242265700008						
J	Takahashi, Y; Kamata, A; Konishi, T				Takahashi, Yoshinori; Kamata, Akira; Konishi, Tatsuya			Dipeptidyl peptidase-IV inhibitory peptides derived from salmon milt and their effects on postprandial blood glucose level	FISHERIES SCIENCE												The hydrolysate of Oncorhynchus keta (chum salmon) milt was found to exhibit strong inhibitory activity against dipeptidyl peptidase-IV (DPP-IV), and the hypoglycaemic effect of these salmon milt peptides (SMPs) was confirmed using oral starch tolerance tests in Sprague-Dawley rats. Specifically, the oral administration of SMPs at a dose of 300 mg/kg body weight for 1 week resulted in a significant decrease in the blood glucose level of the rats 60 min after starch consumption compared with the control. The bioassay-guided separation of SMPs, using a combination of column chromatographic techniques, led to the identification of 12 active di-, tri- and tetrapeptides, including four novel DPP-IV inhibitory peptides, namely Phe-Pro-Val-Gly, Leu-Pro-Val-Leu, Val-Pro-Phe-Pro and Ile-Pro-Leu. Among these 12 peptides, Ile-Pro contributed the most (1.3%) to the total DPP-IV inhibitory activity of SMPs. Therefore, SMPs may have the potential to be used as a suppressor of postprandial hyperglycaemia and to be considered a promising functional food material for the prevention of type II diabetes.

Diel variation in the vertical distribution of deep-water scattering layers in the Gulf of Mexico	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART I-OCEANOGRAPHIC RESEARCH PAPERS												Sound scattering layers (SSLs) are important components of oceanic ecosystems with ubiquitous distribution throughout the world's oceans. This vertical movement is an important mechanism for exchanging organic matter from the surface to the deep ocean, as many of the organisms comprising SSLs serve as prey resources for linking the lower trophic levels to larger predators. Variations in abundance and taxonomic composition of mesopelagic organisms were quantified using repeated discrete net sampling and acoustics over a 30-h survey, performed during 26-27 June 2011 at single site (27 degrees 28'51 '' N and 88 degrees 27'54 '' W) in the northern Gulf of Mexico. We acoustically classified the mesopelagic SSL into four broad taxonomic categories, crustacean and small non-swimbladdered fish (CSNSBF), large non-swimbladdered fish (LNSBF), swimbladdered fish (SBF) and unclassified and we quantified the abundance of mesopelagic organisms over three discrete depth intervals; epipelagic (0-200 m); upper mesopelagic (200-600 m) and lower mesopelagic (600-1000 m). Irrespective of the acoustic categories at dusk part of the acoustic energy redistributed from the mesopelagic into the upper epipelagic (shallower than 100 m) remaining however below the thermocline depth. At night higher variability in species composition was observed between 100 and 200 m suggested that a redistribution of organisms may also occur within the upper portion of the water column. Along the upper mesopelagic backscatter spectra from CSNSBF migrated between 400 and 460 m while spectra from the other categories moved to shallower depths (300 and 350 m), resulting in habitat separation from CSNSBF. Relatively small vertical changes in both acoustic backscatter and center of mass metrics of the deep mesopelagic were observed for CNSBF and LNSBF suggesting that these animals may be tightly connected to deeper (below 1000 m) mesopelagic habitats, and do not routinely migrate into the epipelagic.

Specimens were collected during six oceanographic cruises in Bahia Magdalena (March, July, and December 2004) and in the Gulf of California (November 2005 and January and July 2007). Females attained first spawning when similar to 7.5 mm total length (> 52 days old). Histological evidence indicates that N. simplex females have group-synchronous ovaries, able to produce four broods per gonadic cycle, since ovigerous females develop simultaneously in three and four distinct substages (Oc1, Oc2, Oc3, and Oc4) in their gonads. Once females mature, as shown by pale pink gonads, they may reabsorb their gonads in <4 days. Direct observations indicate that after a variable resting period, the formation of oogonia to vitellogenesis takes similar to 3 days, investing similar to 8% (4-14%) of weight-specific carbon body weight to reproduction (lipid approach) with an average interbrood period of 10 days (range: 7-26 days, estimated by three distinct methods). About 22% of the ovigerous females in the metanauplius stage show gonad development in vitellogenesis, likely spawning between 7 and 9 days. The rest of the female population have an interbrood period that is considerably > 10 days. Embryonic development in the ovigerous sac last <3 days (16 degrees C), hatching always as nauplius (usually 100% hatching success); the metanauplii are released from the ovigerous sac in a median of 5 days after spawning. Although sac-spawning euphausiid species may have comparatively lower total fecundity than broadcast-spawning species, they seem to have relatively similar reproductive effort and higher hatching success that increases larval recruitment rates, compared to similar size temperate broadcast-spawners. This partially explains why sac-spawners of the genera Nyctiphanes, Nematoscelis, and Pseudeuphausia are numerically dominant euphausiids in several highly eutrophic temperate, subtropical, and tropical ecosystems. N. simplex males have a continuous spermatogenesis after they attain size at first maturity; continuously allocating similar to 5.4% of weight-specific carbon to reproduction, results that are significantly different than previous assumptions that euphausiid male spermatogenesis is energetically insignificant.

J	Zielinski, S; Portner, HO				Zielinski, S; Portner, HO			Oxidative stress and antioxidative defense in cephalopods: a function of metabolic rate or age?	COMPARATIVE BIOCHEMISTRY AND PHYSIOLOGY B-BIOCHEMISTRY & MOLECULAR BIOLOGY												Activities of the antioxidative enzymes superoxide dismutase (SOD). catalase, glutathione peroxidase (GPX) and glutathione reductase (GR) were measured in the cephalopods Sepia officinalis and Lolliguncula brevis,is. Maximal enzyme activities were higher in gill tissue than in the mantle musculature of both species. Activities were generally lower in tissues of L. brevis than in S. officinalis. Comparison with other ectothermic animals showed both cephalopod species to have a low enzymatic antioxidative status despite their high metabolic rate. Furthermore, changes in antioxidative enzyme activities were measured in the cuttlefish S. officinalis with increasing age. The concentrations of malondialdehyde (MDA) and lipofuscin were determined as indicators of lipid peroxidation. Investigated animals were between 1.5 months and over 12 months old. Changes of antioxidative enzyme activities with age were not uniform. SOD and GPX activities increased with age, while catalase activity declined. In contrast, GR activity remained almost unchanged in all age groups. The low level of antioxidative defense might allow for the significant age-induced rise in MDA levels in gills and mantle musculature and for the increase in lipofuscin levels in mantle and brain tissue. It might thereby contribute to increased oxidative damage and a short life span in these cephalopods. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

J	Wahle, RA; Tully, O; ODonovan, V				Wahle, RA; Tully, O; ODonovan, V			Lipofuscin as an indicator of age in crustaceans: Analysis of the pigment in the American lobster Homarus americanus	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												Lipofuscin content was determined in the brains of 41 American lobsters Homarus americanus (Milne-Edwards) aged 4, 13 and 27 mo reared individually at 19 to 20 degrees C. Lipofuscin was quantified by fluorescence microscopy and image analysis. Lipofuscin granules occurred in each age group and in the oldest group appeared as large aggregations collectively averaging 2.1% of the area of histological sections of the olfactory lobe cell mass. Carapace length-corrected lipofuscin area % gave the highest correlation with age (r = 0.99, p < 0.0001) and a non-linear best fit regression (y = 0.00264 x Age(2.03)). The size and number of lipofuscin granules and carapace length were also significantly related to age. Lipofuscin concentration was not significantly correlated with carapace length within any of the 3 age classes (4 mo: r = -0.078, 13 mo: r = -0.20, 27 mo: r = -0.351). These results suggest the possibility that the lipofuscin technique can differentiate cohorts in natural populations. However, environmental temperature and the possibility of other factors affecting metabolic rate may need to be taken into account when attempting to apply the laboratory model to wild populations.

Polar marine ecosystems are characterized by low biodiversity and high biological patchiness. The distribution of predators, as a consequence, shows a similar patchiness. During two expeditions of icebreaking RV Polarstern in June-July 2011, biodiversity in the arctic marine zone north of 70A degrees N was very low, with low numbers of species: 20 seabirds, eight cetaceans, five pinnipeds and polar bear. Moreover, a few species accounted for the majority in numbers: four bird species for 95 % of the total of 23,000 seabirds recorded during 700 transect counts: fulmar Fulmarus glacialis, kittiwake Rissa tridactyla, Brunnich's guillemot Uria lomvia and little auk Alle alle. Among the marine mammals, 250 fin whales Balaenoptera physalus accounted for 80 % of the identified large cetaceans, 270 white-beaked dolphin Lagenorhynchus albirostris for 100 % of the small cetaceans and 180 harp seals Pagophilus groenlandica for 80 % of the identified pinnipeds. Their quantitative distribution was depending on water masses and oceanic fronts, large cetaceans-mainly fin whales-showing an important aggregation on the shelf slope off western Spitsbergen, as well as little auks and Brunnich's guillemots. So that this zone, shelf slope and front of mixed Arctic/Atlantic Waters, showed unusually high seabird and cetacean concentrations. Seasonal factors possibly influencing their distribution are addressed.																	0722-4060	1432-2056				NOV	2014	37	11					1645	1657		10.1007/s00300-014-1551-5							WOS:000343141300008

Effectiveness of Annealing Blocking Primers versus Restriction Enzymes for Characterization of Generalist Diets: Unexpected Prey Revealed in the Gut Contents of Two Coral Reef Fish Species	PLOS ONE												Characterization of predator-prey interactions is challenging as researchers have to rely on indirect methods that can be costly, biased and too imprecise to elucidate the complexity of food webs. DNA amplification and sequencing techniques of gut and fecal contents are promising approaches, but their success largely depends on the ability to amplify the taxonomic array of prey consumed and then match prey amplicons with reference sequences. When little a priori information on diet is available or a generalist predator is targeted, versatile primer sets (also referred to as universal or general primers) as opposed to group- or species-specific primer sets are the most powerful to unveil the full range of prey consumed. However, versatile primers are likely to preferentially amplify the predominant, less degraded predator DNA if no manipulation is performed to exclude this confounding DNA template. In this study we compare two approaches that eliminate the confounding predator template: restriction digestion and the use of annealing blocking primers. First, we use a preliminary DNA barcode library provided by the Moorea BIOCODE project to 1) evaluate the cutting frequency of commercially available restriction enzymes and 2) design predator specific annealing blocking primers. We then compare the performance of the two predator removal strategies for the detection of prey templates using two versatile primer sets from the gut contents of two generalist coral reef fish species sampled in Moorea. Our study demonstrates that blocking primers should be preferentially used over restriction digestion for predator DNA removal as they recover greater prey diversity. We also emphasize that a combination of versatile primers may be required to best represent the breadth of a generalist's diet.

An effective strategy to enhance physiological flexibility is the expression of polymorphic enzymes. This seems to be the case in the brown shrimp Crangon crangon. It shows high reproduction rates, feeds opportunistically on endo- and epibenthic organisms, and is apparently well adapted to variable environmental conditions. Previous electrophoretic studies revealed a high level of polymorphism and no consistent phenotype of digestive enzymes between individuals. In order to understand the underlying biochemical processes, we carried out a transcriptome-based study of digestive enzymes of C. crangon. Detailed sequence analyses of triacylglycerol lipase, phospholipase A(2), alpha amylase, chitinase, trypsin and cathepsin L were performed to identify putative isoforms. The number of isoforms, and thus the degree of polymorphism varied among enzymes: lipases and carbohydrases showed higher numbers of isoforms in enzymes that besides their extracellular function also have diverse intracellular functions. Furthermore, cysteine proteinases showed a lower polymorphism than serine proteinases. We suggest that the expression of enzyme isoforms improves the efficiency of C. crangon in gaining energy from different food sources.

Accounting for biological and physical sources of acoustic backscatter improves estimates of zooplankton biomass	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												To convert measurements of backscattered acoustic energy to estimates of abundance and taxonomic information about the zooplankton community, all of the scattering processes in the water column need to be identified and their scattering contributions quantified. Zooplankton populations in the eastern edge of Wilkinson Basin in the Gulf of Maine in the Northwest Atlantic were surveyed in October 1997. Net tow samples at different depths, temperature and salinity profiles, and multiple frequency acoustic backscatter measurements from the upper 200 m of the water column were collected. Zooplankton samples were identified, enumerated, and measured. Temperature and salinity profiles were used to estimate the amount of turbulent microstructure in the water column. These data sets were used with theoretical acoustic scattering models to calculate the contributions of both biological and physical scatterers to the overall measured scattering level. The output of these predictions shows that the dominant source of acoustic backscatter varies with depth and acoustic frequency in this region. By quantifying the contributions from multiple scattering sources, acoustic backscatter becomes a better measure of net-collected zooplankton bio-mass.

Cold Regime Interannual Variability of Primary and Secondary Producer Community Composition in the Southeastern Bering Sea	PLOS ONE												Variability of hydrographic conditions and primary and secondary productivity between cold and warm climatic regimes in the Bering Sea has been the subject of much study in recent years, while interannual variability within a single regime and across multiple trophic levels has been less well-documented. Measurements from an instrumented mooring on the southeastern shelf of the Bering Sea were analyzed for the spring-to-summer transitions within the cold regime years of 2009-2012 to investigate the interannual variability of hydrographic conditions, primary producer biomass, and acoustically-derived secondary producer and consumer abundance and community structure. Hydrographic conditions in 2012 were significantly different than in 2009, 2010, and 2011, driven largely by increased ice extent and thickness, later ice retreat, and earlier stratification of the water column. Primary producer biomass was more tightly coupled to hydrographic conditions in 2012 than in 2009 or 2011, and shallow and mid-column phytoplankton blooms tended to occur independent of one another. There was a high degree of variability in the relationships between different classes of secondary producers and hydrographic conditions, evidence of significant intraconsumer interactions, and trade-offs between different consumer size classes in each year. Phytoplankton blooms stimulated different populations of secondary producers in each year, and summer consumer populations appeared to determine dominant populations in the subsequent spring. Overall, primary producers and secondary producers were more tightly coupled to each other and to hydrographic conditions in the coldest year compared to the warmer years. The highly variable nature of the interactions between the atmospherically-driven hydrographic environment, primary and secondary producers, and within food webs underscores the need to revisit how climatic regimes within the Bering Sea are defined and predicted to function given changing climate scenarios.

J	Schell, C; Jaffe, JS				Schell, C; Jaffe, JS			Experimental verification of an interpolation algorithm for improved estimates of animal position	JOURNAL OF THE ACOUSTICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA												This article presents experimental verification of an interpolation algorithm that was previously proposed in Jaffe [J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 105, 3168-3175 (1999)]. The goal of the algorithm is to improve estimates of both target position and target strength by minimizing a least-squares residual between noise-corrupted target measurement data and the output of a model of the sonar's amplitude response to a target at a set of known locations. Although this positional estimator was shown to be a maximum likelihood estimator, in principle, experimental verification was desired because of interest in understanding, its true performance. Here, the accuracy of the algorithm is investigated by analyzing the correspondence between a target's true position and the algorithm's estimate. True target position was measured by precise translation of a small test target (bead) or from the analysis of images of fish from a coregistered optical imaging system. Results with the stationary spherical test bead in a high signal-to-noise environment indicate that a large increase in resolution is possible, while results with commercial aquarium fish indicate a smaller increase is obtainable. However, in both experiments the algorithm provides improved estimates of target position over those obtained by simply accepting the angular positions of the sonar beam with maximum output as target position. In addition, increased accuracy in target strength estimation is possible by considering the effects of the sonar beam patterns relative to the interpolated position. A benefit of the algorithm is that it can be applied "ex post facto" to existing data sets from commercial multibeam sonar systems when only the beam intensities have been stored after suitable calibration.

This may include resources such as species from lower trophic levels, by-products and by-catch from fisheries and aquaculture, animal by-products, plants, genetically modified (GM) plants, nutritionally enhanced GM plants and products from microorganisms and GM microorganisms. Here, we report on a deliberative assessment of these alternative feed resources, involving 18 participants from different interest groups within Norwegian salmon aquaculture. The participants defined a broad range of appraisal criteria concerning health and welfare issues, economical issues, environmental issues, and knowledge and social issues. A number of uncertainties, in the form of incomplete knowledge, diverging opinions, and context specific factors were identified when the participants evaluated the alternatives. Our findings support the need for more research on the suitability of alternative feed resources for farmed salmon. Additionally, the study underlines the importance of facilitating deliberative assessments in order to map the plurality of perspectives and explore qualitative aspects of uncertainty. Such initiatives improve the information base upon which decisions on future feed resources for farmed salmon are made.

The results show that sulfhydryl group is essential for the activity of the enzyme. Inhibitory kinetics of the enzyme by mercuric chloride (HgCl2) has been studied using the kinetic method of the substrate reaction during inhibitor of enzyme. The kinetic results show that the inhibition of the enzyme by mercuric ion (Hg2+) at lower than 1.0 mu M is a reversible reaction with residual activity and the inhibition belongs to be competitive. The inhibition kinetics model of Hg2+ on the enzyme was set up and the microscopic rate constants were determined and the data obtained were well fitted with the model. It was also turned out that only one molecule of HgCl2 binds to the enzyme molecule to lead the enzyme lose its activity. The above results suggest that the cysteine residue is essential for activity and is situated at the active site of the enzyme. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Stanton, TK; Chu, DZ				Stanton, TK; Chu, DZ			Review and recommendations for the modelling of acoustic scattering by fluid-like elongated zooplankton: euphausiids and copepods	ICES JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE												Acoustic echo sounders are commonly used to survey zooplankton. An essential element in the methods is the acoustic scattering model, which relates acoustic echo data to meaningful biological parameters such as size and numerical density. Because of the importance of scattering models, there has been much development of models of increasing sophistication. With the increase in sophistication is an associated improvement in accuracy, but possibly at the cost of increased effort in implementing the model. Thus the practical question is which model provides sufficient accuracy for the scientific problem of interest. This paper presents a modelling study using a wide range of models, ranging from simple to complex representation of the animals, a synthesis of previously published laboratory scattering data from a variety of sources, and laboratory data presented for the first time. The focus is on fluid-like zooplankton (i.e., animals that do not support shear waves) with examples specific to euphausiids, shrimp, and copepods. The simplest model is the sphere with homogeneous material properties while the most complex is a high-resolution digitized form of each zooplankton taking into account surficial roughness and inhomogeneities of the material properties. The results show that there are conditions under which very simple, easy-to-use models can be used with reasonable accuracy while there are other conditions where the more complex models must be used.

The specific ingestion rates of algal biomass declined with increasing size of the species (A. glacialis, 51; Onisimus spp., 11; G. wilkitzkii, 2 ng chl a equival. mg(-1) dry mass d(-1)). Juveniles of Onisimus spp. and G. wilkitzkii had specific rates that were 1 to 2 orders of magnitude higher than those of the respective adults. Calculations of the carbon budget and observations of amphipods behaviour indicate that A. glacialis is predominantely herbivorous, whereas Onisimus spp, are herbivorous/detritivorous, and G. wilkitzkii is herbivorous/detritivorous/carnivorous. The grazing impact on the ice-algal standing stock at the ice underside in summer, estimated for 2 different areas in the Arctic, was low (1.1% d(-1) in the Laptev Sea, 2.6 % d(-1) in the Greenland Sea), indicating that food is not a limiting factor in this habitat.																	0171-8630	1616-1599					1997	160						93	99		10.3354/meps160093							WOS:000071722800009

Herein, we conducted a randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind, crossover study of healthy Japanese subjects to investigate the effect of glucose loading on postprandial blood glucose levels after one week of administering continuous or single dose of 500 mg of SMP. The primary and secondary outcomes of reduced blood glucose and insulin levels were not met in the 14 subjects included in the analysis. This may be due to the ineffectiveness of SMP in insulin resistance due to its DPP-IV inhibitory activity. Therefore, we conducted a SMP subgroup analysis based on the homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR); the group with normal HOMA-IR (<1.6) had a significantly lower area under the curve and blood glucose at 60 min after glucose loading than the group with HOMA-IR >= 1.6. These results suggest that SMP is effective in subjects without insulin resistance. There were no adverse events associated with the test food, and SMP was considered safe. This report is the first to investigate the effect of a food ingredient with DPP-IV inhibitory activity in a clinical trial.

Relationship of morphometrics, total carotenoids, and total lipids with activity and sexual and spatial features in Euphausia superba	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS												Morphological differences associated with sex or stage, together with total lipids and carotenoids, were studied in Euphausia superba as possible indicators of physiological condition. E. superba displays sexual dimorphism during growth. A group of mature males, called Males II herein, has a greater abdominal length, suggesting that they are faster swimmers, a feature implying higher metabolic rates and a higher demand for protecting pigments like carotenoids. Mature Males II have proportionally lower lipids but higher total lipid-soluble carotenoids, a counterintuitive finding. Males II also have bigger eyes. Significant regressions with carotenoids were found for wet weight, abdominal length, and eye diameter. On a spatial analysis, population composition reflects reproductive activity. Males II would be in search of females for fecundation and, thus, are dominant in some areas. The PCA analysis of 10 allometric and biochemical variables show a distinct Males II group differing in morphology, carotenoids, and lipid contents. The carotenoid:lipid ratio was highest for Males II, supporting the hypothesis of the role of carotenoids in the activity of the species. Mature males may experience physiological stress during reproduction and probably die shortly afterwards. A relationship between activity, morphometrics, and carotenoid content seems evident, deserving further investigation.Y																	2045-2322					AUG 6	2020	10	1							13177	10.1038/s41598-020-69780-8							WOS:000573233300006	32764584					
J	ODonovan, V; Tully, O				ODonovan, V; Tully, O			Lipofuscin (age pigment) as an index of crustacean age: Correlation with age, temperature and body size in cultured juvenile Homarus gammarus L.	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY												Morphological lipofuscin was quantified in laboratory cultured Homarus gammarus to determine if the amount of pigment was correlated with age and culture temperature in this species. Two cohorts were monitored for 34 and 18 months, respectively. An age dependent accumulation of lipofuscin concentration (expressed as % area fraction) occurred (Y = -2.22 + 0.084X, R(2) = 46.8%, p less than or equal to 0.0001 and incorporating carapace length as a covariate). Carapace length accounted for 3.3% of the variation in lipofuscin. The effect of temperature on lipofuscin accumulation was assessed using three regimes: 8, 11 and 13.5 +/- 5 degrees C. Temperature had a significant effect on lipofuscin accumulation (F = 15.9, p less than or equal to 0.0009). Carapace length also responded significantly to temperature although the trend was nor linear (F = 68.1, p < 0.0001). There was no significant correlation between lipofuscin concentration and body size in lobsters of the same age (r = 0.067, -0.2, 0.154 and 0.5 for each of four groups). The age dependent increase in morphological lipofuscin and the lack of correlation between body size and lipofuscin in cultured H. gammarus indicates significant potential for this technique as a method of ageing lobsters. As lipofuscin accumulation is a function of metabolic age, factors other than temperature, such as population density, which affects growth rate in the wild, could potentially affect metabolic rate and therefore lipofuscin accumulation. However the independence between growth and lipofuscin in laboratory animals indicates that this may not be a problem.																	0022-0981					DEC 15	1996	207	1-2					1	14		10.1016/S0022-0981(96)02662-7							WOS:A1996VZ49600001						
J	Boer, M; Graeve, M; Kattner, G				Boer, Marco; Graeve, Martin; Kattner, Gerhard			Exceptional long-term starvation ability and sites of lipid storage of the Arctic pteropod Clione limacina	POLAR BIOLOGY												The Arctic pteropod Clione limacina was collected in Kongsfjorden, Svalbard, in mid June 2004, to study the lipid metabolism within the sites of lipid storage structures during long-term starvation. Animals survived in an aquarium without any food for nearly 1 year (356 days). Size, number of lipid droplets, dry and lipid mass, lipid class and fatty acid compositions of C. limacina were determined and separately analysed for the digestive gland and the remaining integument. During the starvation period, animals shrunk from 22.4 to 12 mm in length on average, and the number of lipid droplets decreased from 1,600 to 1,000 per animal. Dry mass (DM) and total lipid mass both dropped by about 80% from day 200 to the end. The lipid content as percentage DM of the total organism did not decrease significantly ranging from 43.8 to 32.3%DM. The lipid content of the trunk was moderate with about 20%DM. The digestive gland was very rich in lipids with more than 70%DM throughout the experiment and is the major site of lipid metabolism and storage. Triacylglycerols (TAG) decreased, in the total organism, from high initial levels of 62.6 to 43% of total lipid at the end. In contrast, the proportions of 1-O-alkyldiacylglycerols [diacylglycerol ethers (DAGE)] remained almost constant, varying between 20.4 and 28.4%. In the digestive gland, TAG ranged from 60.3 to 64.8% and DAGE from 23.6 to 32.2% from day 200 to the end of the experiment. TAG and DAGE of the trunk were most likely located in the lipid droplets and were almost depleted at the end of starvation. Besides their function as lipid deposit DAGE may also act as protecting substance against bacterial and fungal infections. During the first 200 days of starvation, the fatty acid compositions showed only small variations. Thereafter, fatty acids typical for storage lipids decreased in all body compartments. In adaptation to long periods of food scarcity, C. limacina has evolved various strategies as body shrinkage, utilisation of body constituents not essential for survival, a very low metabolism and slow lipid consumption.

J	Trevorrow, MV; Mackas, DL; Benfield, MC				Trevorrow, MV; Mackas, DL; Benfield, MC			Comparison of multifrequency acoustic and in situ measurements of zooplankton abundances in Knight Inlet, British Columbia	JOURNAL OF THE ACOUSTICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA												An investigation of midwater zooplankton aggregations in a coastal fjord was conducted in November 2002. This study focused on quantitative comparisons between a calibrated, three-frequency (38, 120, and 200 kHz) vessel-based echo-sounder, a multinet towed zooplankton sampler (BIONESS), and a high-resolution underwater camera (ZOOVIS). Daytime layers of euphausiids and amphipods near 70-90-m depth were observed in lower parts of the inlet, especially concentrated by tidal flows around a sill. Quantitative backscatter measurements of euphausiids and amphipods, combined with in situ size and abundance estimates, and using an assumed tilt-angle distribution, were in agreement with averaged fluid-cylinder scattering models produced by Stanton and Chu [ICES J. Mar. Sci. 57, 793-807, (2000)]. Acoustic measurements of physonect siphonophores in the upper inlet were found to have a strong 38-kHz scattering strength, in agreement with a damped bubble scattering model using a diameter of 0.4 mm. In relatively dense euphausiid layers, ZOOVIS abundance estimates were found to be a factor of 2 to 4 higher than the acoustic estimates, potentially due to deviations from assumed euphausiid orientation. Nocturnal near-surface euphausiid scattering exhibited a strong (15 dB) and rapid (seconds) sensitivity to vessel lights, interpreted as due to changing animal orientation.																	0001-4966	1520-8524				JUN	2005	117	6					3574	3588		10.1121/1.1920087							WOS:000229718500028	16018461

SOCIAL AGGREGATION IN THE PELAGIC ZONE WITH SPECIAL REFERENCE TO FISH AND INVERTEBRATES	ADVANCES IN MARINE BIOLOGY, VOL 60	Advances in Marine Biology											Aggregations of organisms, ranging from zooplankton to whales, are an extremely common phenomenon in the pelagic zone; perhaps the best known are fish schools. Social aggregation is a special category that refers to groups that self-organize and maintain cohesion to exploit benefits such as protection from predators, and location and capture of resources more effectively and with greater energy efficiency than could a solitary individual. In this review we explore general aggregation principles, with specific reference to pelagic organisms; describe a range of new technologies either designed for studying aggregations or that could potentially be exploited for this purpose; report on the insights gained from theoretical modelling; discuss the relationship between social aggregation and ocean management; and speculate on the impact of climate change. Examples of aggregation occur in all animal phyla. Among pelagic organisms, it is possible that repeated co-occurrence of stable pairs of individuals, which has been established for some schooling fish, is the likely precursor leading to networks of social interaction and more complex social behaviour. Social network analysis has added new insights into social behaviour and allows us to dissect aggregations and to examine how the constituent individuals interact with each other. This type of analysis is well advanced in pinnipeds and cetaceans, and work on fish is progressing. Detailed three-dimensional analysis of schools has proved to be difficult, especially at sea, but there has been some progress recently. The technological aids for studying social aggregation include video and acoustics, and have benefited from advances in digitization, miniaturization, motion analysis and computing power. New techniques permit three-dimensional tracking of thousands of individual animals within a single group which has allowed novel insights to within-group interactions. Approaches using theoretical modelling of aggregations have a long history but only recently have hypotheses been tested empirically. The lack of synchrony between models and empirical data, and lack of a common framework to schooling models have hitherto hampered progress; however, recent developments in this field offer considerable promise. Further, we speculate that climate change, already having effects on ecosystems, could have dramatic effects on aggregations through its influence on species composition by altering distribution ranges, migration patterns, vertical migration, and oceanic acidity. Because most major commercial fishing targets schooling species, these changes could have important consequences for the dependent businesses.

Recovering populations have been observed to alter their behaviour. These changes have been attributed to climate change in some cases and raise concerns over the successful recovery of baleen whale populations. Current data-driven statistical habitat and behavioural models have proven useful for addressing questions of whale distribution changes within their limitations. Given observed changes in oceanic conditions, a new approach to managing baleen whale population recovery is necessary. Model predictions of future whale movements and distributions under climate change scenarios are vital to enable adequate conservation management. This paper presents a new perspective on understanding the impacts of climate change on humpback whales, arguing the need for a system-based multidisciplinary research approach. Our approach includes coupled, mechanistic models based upon robust ecological principles, and integrates key physical, biogeochemical, biological and ecological modules to address long-term changes associated with climate change. To illustrate the need for this system-based multidisciplinary approach, we focus on Southern Hemisphere humpback whales, the recovery of which may be impacted by rapid changes in habitat conditions brought about by anthropogenic climate change.

CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												A small number of stationary echo sounders have the potential to produce abundance indices where fish repeatedly occupy localized areas (e.g., spawning grounds). To investigate this possibility, we deployed three trawl-resistant moorings with a newly designed autonomous echo sounder for similar to 85 days during the walleye pollock (Gadus chalcogrammus) spawning season in Shelikof Strait, Alaska. Backscatter observed from the moorings was highly correlated with ship-based acoustic surveys, suggesting that the mooring observations reflect abundance over much larger areas than the observation volume of the acoustic beam. A retrospective analysis of a 19-year time series of prespawning walleye pollock surveys was used to select mooring locations and determine that three to five moorings can produce an index of walleye pollock backscatter comparable to that produced by a ship-based survey covering similar to 18 000 km(2) (mean prediction error of <11% for five moorings). The three moorings deployed in Shelikof Strait yielded a backscatter estimate that was within similar to 15%-20% of that observed during the survey. Thus, it appears feasible to design a relatively sparse mooring array to provide abundance information and other aspects of fish behavior in this environment.

Population migration speeds on ascent versus descent (mean +/- 1 SD) were not significantly different when estimated from the mode (or leading/trailing edge) of the population and were 0.59 +/- 0.24 cm s(-1) in ascent (0.96 +/- 0.25 cm s(-1) leading edge) and 0.67 +/- 0.13 cm s(-1) on descent (0.78 +/- 0.14 cm s(-1) trailing edge). The SD in start times of the ascent over the six nights was only 3 min, and that in the times of the completion of the descent was 7 min. Emergence began after and reentry was completed before downwelling irradiance at photosynthetically active wavelengths 1 m above bottom reached 0.5 x 10(-6) mumol quanta cm(-1) s(-1). Migrators increased column scattering strength at 265 kHz by a factor of 14. Emergence-trap samples and nighttime plankton tows suggested that the migrating population was dominated by mysids, mostly Neomysis kadiakensis. Our acoustic results suggest that emergence is much more prevalent and important in coastal and estuarine environments than trapping and net sampling can reveal and hence that this important component of benthic-pelagic coupling requires additional attention both in measurements and in theoretical treatments.																	0024-3590					MAY	2003	48	3					1223	1234		10.4319/lo.2003.48.3.1223							WOS:000182982300028

Use of the distorted wave Born approximation to predict scattering by inhomogeneous objects: Application to squid	JOURNAL OF THE ACOUSTICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA												A new method has been developed to predict acoustic scattering by weakly scattering objects with three-dimensional variability in sound speed and density. This variability can take the form of inhomogeneities within the body of the scatterer and/or geometries where the acoustic wave passes through part of the scattering body, into the surrounding medium, and back into the body. This method applies the distorted wave Born approximation (DWBA) using a numerical approach that rigorously accounts for the phase changes within a scattering volume. Ranges of validity with respect to material properties and numerical considerations are first explored through comparisons with modal-series-based predictions of scattering by fluid-filled spherical and cylindrical fluid shells. The method is then applied to squid and incorporates high resolution spiral computerized tomography (SCT) scans of the complex morphology of the organism. Target strength predictions based on the SCT scans are compared with published backscattering data from live, freely swimming and tethered squid. The new method shows significant improvement for both single-orientation and orientation-averaged scattering predictions over the DWBA-homogeneous-prolate-spheroid model.

J	Castro, M; Encarnacao, P; Tully, O				Castro, M; Encarnacao, P; Tully, O			The effect of dietary antioxidants on lipofuscin accumulation in the crustacean brain	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY												Lipofuscin accumulation is associated with ageing at the subcellular level. A strong correlation between lipofuscin and age has been found in crustaceans using histological techniques. This association has been proposed as the basis for a methodology to age crustaceans and in some cases lipofuscin levels were found to be better correlated with age than size. The experiment presented here was designed to test the potential effect of diet, in particular dietary antioxidants, on lipofuscin accumulation and age estimation. The shrimp, Penaeus japonicus, was reared in an aquaculture facility and fed commercial pellets, with modified vitamins C and E contents. One group was fed with levels of vitamins C and E of 1000 and 150 mg/kg, respectively, and another group with 2500 and 5000 mg/kg, respectively. The experiment started when the shrimp were 19 weeks old. Samples were obtained at this point and at ages 33 and 43 weeks. Lipofuscin was measured in the nerve cords (antennal neuropils and oesophageal connectives) in an area adjacent to the brain. Dietary antioxidants significantly affected lipofuscin levels. High vitamin content in the diet resulted in lower percentage of the observed area covered with lipofuscin, lower lipofuscin granule density and lower average granule size. Gender had no effect on any of these variables and granule size did not significantly change within each treatment. Lipofuscin area and granule density increased with age in both vitamin treatments. These results suggest that age estimation using lipofuscin indices may be biased when; (1) wild populations are dispersed over diverse environments; (2) the age estimation of wild individuals is based on the results obtained using laboratory-reared individuals.

Orientation dependence of broadband acoustic backscattering from live squid	JOURNAL OF THE ACOUSTICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA												A controlled laboratory experiment of broadband acoustic backscattering from live squid (Loligo pealeii) was conducted using linear chirp signals (60-103 kHz) with data collected over the full 360 degrees of orientation in the lateral plane, in <1 degrees increments. The acoustic measurements were compared with an analytical prolate spheroid model and a three-dimensional numerical model with randomized squid shape, both based on the distorted-wave Born approximation formulation. The data were consistent with the hypothesized fluid-like scattering properties of squid. The contributions from the front and back interfaces of the squid were found to dominate the scattering at normal incidence, while the arms had a significant effect at other angles. The three-dimensional numerical model predictions out-performed the prolate spheroid model over a wide range of orientations. The predictions were found to be sensitive to the shape parameters, including the arms and the fins. Accurate predictions require setting these shape parameters to best describe the most probable squid shape for different applications. The understanding developed here serves as a basis for the accurate interpretation of in situ acoustic scattering measurements of squid. (C) 2012 Acoustical Society of America.

J	Peijnenburg, KTCA; Goetze, E				Peijnenburg, Katja T. C. A.; Goetze, Erica			High evolutionary potential of marine zooplankton	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION												Open ocean zooplankton often have been viewed as slowly evolving species that have limited capacity to respond adaptively to changing ocean conditions. Hence, attention has focused on the ecological responses of zooplankton to current global change, including range shifts and changing phenology. Here, we argue that zooplankton also are well poised for evolutionary responses to global change. We present theoretical arguments that suggest plankton species may respond rapidly to selection on mildly beneficial mutations due to exceptionally large population size, and consider the circumstantial evidence that supports our inference that selection may be particularly important for these species. We also review all primary population genetic studies of open ocean zooplankton and show that genetic isolation can be achieved at the scale of gyre systems in open ocean habitats (100s to 1000s of km). Furthermore, population genetic structure often varies across planktonic taxa, and appears to be linked to the particular ecological requirements of the organism. In combination, these characteristics should facilitate adaptive evolution to distinct oceanographic habitats in the plankton. We conclude that marine zooplankton may be capable of rapid evolutionary as well as ecological responses to changing ocean conditions, and discuss the implications of this view. We further suggest two priority areas for future research to test our hypothesis of high evolutionary potential in open ocean zooplankton, which will require (1) assessing how pervasive selection is in driving population divergence and (2) rigorously quantifying the spatial and temporal scales of population differentiation in the open ocean.

J	De Robertis, A; Cokelet, ED				De Robertis, Alex; Cokelet, Edward D.			Distribution of fish and macrozooplankton in ice-covered and open-water areas of the eastern Bering Sea	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY												The eastern Bering Sea shelf is a productive ecosystem with extensive commercial fisheries. Although the area is well-studied during summer months, little is known about the abundance and distribution of fish and macrozooplankton during periods of seasonal ice cover. The use of an icebreaker during the Bering Sea Ecosystem Study (BEST) provided a platform for spring acoustic surveys of fish and zooplankton in ice-covered areas for the first time. Icebreaker measurements were complemented with observations from conventional vessels during spring and summer. In spring, very little backscatter from fish (dominated by walleye pollock, Theragra chalcogramma) was observed in the ice-covered northern areas where near-bottom waters were cold (<similar to 0.5 degrees C), including areas where walleye pollock are abundant in summer. The majority of fish were observed within 40 km (and often slightly inside) the ice edge over similar seafloor depths as in summer. Together, these observations suggest that pollock, a dominant component of the ecosystem, shift their distribution to a more restricted geographic area in spring, following the ice edge southeast along the bathymetry, away from areas of cold water and extensive ice cover, then reoccupying these areas in summer. In contrast, acoustic backscatter attributed to zooplankton (likely dominated by euphausiids) was more evenly distributed, and less restricted by water temperature and ice cover. The implications of this seasonal shift in fish distribution are uncertain, but this may affect predator-prey interactions by reducing overlap of pollock with euphausiids, an important prey source, while increasing overlap of adult and juvenile pollock and potentially increasing cannibalism.

J	Rumsey, SM; Franks, PJS				Rumsey, SM; Franks, PJS			Influence of variability in larval development on recruitment success in the euphausiid Euphausia pacifica: elasticity and sensitivity analyses	MARINE BIOLOGY												Simple life-history models were employed to identify those larval stages of Euphausia pacifica (Hansen) with the greatest potential contribution to variability in recruitment success. Using stage-specific vital parameters (i.e. stage duration and specific mortality) the models explored the influence of developmental variability without ascribing the variability to any particular cause or forcing. Through such a non-mechanistic modelling approach, the critical periods in larval development were determined. The results led to inferences about larval population responses to temperature/food heterogeneity in the natural environment. Peaks in recruitment-success elasticity were evident for variability imposed during the egg and Furcilia I and II stages. The high elasticity of the egg stage suggested the importance of female nutrition and the timing and location of egg release in determining their viability and subsequent recruitment success. Peak elasticity during the Furcilia I and II stages supported the notion that indirect developmental pathways of pleopod development during these stages may be associated with diminished recruitment success. Sensitivity analyses further highlighted the influence of these early furcilia stages in determining recruitment success, and also suggested the importance of the Furcilia III and VII stages. The robustness of elasticity and sensitivity results with respect to the life-history structure utilized is discussed. A criterion is presented for the identification of life-history structures which might obscure the true elasticity relationships of a developmental sequence.																	0025-3162					MAR	1999	133	2					283	291		10.1007/s002270050467							WOS:000079269700012

Theoretical models have been developed for three zooplankton scattering classes (hard elastic-shelled, e.g., pteropods; fluid-like, e,g,, euphausiids; and gas-bearing, e.g., siphonophores), providing a sound basis for model-based classification approaches. The Covariance Mean Variance Classification (CMVC) techniques classify broad-band echoes from individual zooplankton based on comparisons of observed echo spectra to model space realizations. Three different CMVC algorithms were developed: the Integrated Score Classifier, the Pairwise Score Classifier, and the Bayesian Probability Classifier; these classifiers assign observations to a class based on similarities in covariance, mean, and variance while accounting for model space ambiguity and validity. The CMVC techniques were applied to broad-band (similar to 350-750 kHz) echoes acquired from 24 different zooplankton to invert for scatterer class and properties. All three classification algorithms had a high rate of success with high-quality high SNR data. Accurate acoustic classification of zooplankton species has the potential to significantly improve estimates of zooplankton biomass made from ocean acoustic backscatter measurements.

The key species on the Arctic shelf, the calanoid copepod Calanus glacialis, grows and accumulates lipid reserves in spring and summer in surface waters. The winter is spent in dormancy in deeper water layers with low metabolic activity. As timing and intensity of metabolic changes have been poorly investigated, our study aims to characterize the physiology of C. glacialis over an entire year, from July 2012 to July 2013. We followed anabolic and catabolic enzyme activities and the biochemical composition of this species, taking depth-stratified samples once a month in Billefjorden, a high-Arctic sill fjord. A large part of the population had migrated to depths > 100 m by July 2012. Only thereafter, anabolic activities decreased slowly, suggesting that low metabolism is related to ceased feeding rather than to endogenous regulation. During overwintering, anabolic enzyme activities were reduced by half as compared to peak activities in spring. The biochemical composition of the copepods changed little from July to December. Then, the lipid catabolic activity increased and the lipid content decreased, likely fuelling moulting and gonad maturation. The protein content did not change significantly during winter, suggesting that proteins are not much catabolized during that time. The relatively high metabolic activity in C. glacialis in winter suggests that this species is not entering a true diapause and should thus be able to respond flexible to changing environmental conditions.				; Graeve, Martin/B-5751-2017	Niehoff, Barbara/0000-0002-7483-9373; Graeve, Martin/0000-0002-2294-1915												0025-3162	1432-1793				JAN	2017	164	1							3	10.1007/s00227-016-3036-2							WOS:000392332900003

Material properties of euphausiids and other zooplankton from the Bering Sea	JOURNAL OF THE ACOUSTICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA												Acoustic assessment of Bering Sea euphausiids and their predators can provide useful data for ecosystem studies if the acoustic scattering characteristics of these animals are known. The amount of acoustic energy that is scattered by different marine zooplankton taxa is strongly affected by the contrast of the animal's density (g) and sound speed (h) with the surrounding seawater. Density and sound speed contrast were measured in the Bering Sea during the summer of 2008 for several different zooplankton and nekton taxa including: euphausiids (Thysanoessa inermis, Thysanoessa raschii, and Thysanoessa spinifera), copepods, amphipods, chaetognaths, gastropods, fish larvae, jellyfish, and squid. Density contrast values varied between different taxa as well as between individual animals within the same species. Sound speed contrast was measured for monospecific groups of animals and differences were found among taxa. The range, mean, and standard deviation of g and h for all euphausiid species were: g=1.001-1.041; 1.018 +/- 0.009 and h=0.990-1.017; 1.006 +/- 0.008. Changes in the relationship between euphausiid material properties and animal length, seawater temperature, seawater density, and geographic location were also evaluated. Results suggest that environmental conditions at different sample locations led to significant differences in animal density and material properties. (C) 2010 Acoustical Society of America.

Yeast diets contained spray-dried untreated P. rhodozyma, heat-treated and spray-dried P. rhodozyma, and heat-treated and chemically treated spray-dried P. rhodozyma. Growth, weight, and fork length of all fish increased linearly with feeding and were not significantly different at the end of the study. Astaxanthin concentration in all pigmented fish increased linearly and ranged from 3.26 to 3.78 mg/kg after 150 d of feeding. Apart from the nonpigmented diet, astaxanthin concentration was not significantly different between fish fed the untreated or treated red yeast and those fed the synthetic astaxanthin diet (control). Assessment of astaxanthin isomers corroborated the assimilation of the (3R,3'R) isomer from all P. rhodozyma diets. Moisture, ash, and protein in all fish declined linearly with time, whereas lipid increased, but only during the first 30 d of feeding. Fatty acid profiles of all fish were virtually identical and independent of the source of pigment. No beneficial or adverse nutritional effects to the fish resulted from the use of modified red yeast.																	1522-2055					JAN	2001	63	1					52	57		10.1577/1548-8454(2001)063<0052:PACOFO>2.0.CO;2							WOS:000167944700009						
J	Goldthwait, S; Yen, J; Brown, J; Alldredge, A				Goldthwait, S; Yen, J; Brown, J; Alldredge, A			Quantification of marine snow fragmentation by swimming euphausiids	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Sinking of marine snow is a major mechanism of particulate carbon transport from surface waters to the seafloor. Any process altering the abundance or size of marine snow influences carbon flux and food availability to pelagic and benthic organisms. We explored whether zooplankton can alter carbon transport by a new mechanism-physical fragmentation of marine snow. The fluid stress created around the appendages of swimming Euphausia pacifica is capable of fragmenting a single aggregate into multiple, smaller aggregates. The reduced size and slower sinking rate of the daughter aggregates may increase their residence time in the water column, promoting decomposition and decreasing particle flux to depth. To determine the importance of fragmentation, tethered and free-swimming euphausiids were videotaped in the presence of marine snow representing a range of aggregate strengths, sizes, and ages. Image analysis was used to characterize the particles prior to and following fragmentation and to determine the area of influence around a single euphausiid. Tethered euphausiids pulled in particles from an average of 6.7 mm away, and most aggregates were fragmented in either the region of the rapidly beating pleopods or in the high-velocity jet that forms off the tail. Euphausiids were capable of fragmenting all aggregate types and produced an average of 7.3 daughter particles, with 60% of these daughter particles remaining within the marine snow size class ( > 0.5 mm). Thus, physical fragmentation by swimming euphausiids increases the abundance of marine snow while decreasing overall marine snow mass. This novel process, which alters particle size structure without loss of total particulate organic carbon (POC), will be important in upwelling regions where euphausiids are the dominant macrozooplankton migrators.

Optimal Control and Cold War Dynamics between Plant and Herbivore	AMERICAN NATURALIST												Herbivores eat the leaves that a plant needs for photosynthesis. However, the degree of antagonism between plant and herbivore may depend critically on the timing of their interactions and the intrinsic value of a leaf. We present a model that investigates whether and when the timing of plant defense and herbivore feeding activity can be optimized by evolution so that their interactions can move from antagonistic to neutral. We assume that temporal changes in environmental conditions will affect intrinsic leaf value, measured as potential carbon gain. Using optimal-control theory, we model herbivore evolution, first in response to fixed plant strategies and then under coevolutionary dynamics in which the plant also evolves in response to the herbivore. In the latter case, we solve for the evolutionarily stable strategies of plant defense induction and herbivore hatching rate under different ecological conditions. Our results suggest that the optimal strategies for both plant and herbivore are to avoid direct conflict. As long as the plant has the capability for moderately lethal defense, the herbivore will modify its hatching rate to avoid plant defenses, and the plant will never have to use them. Insights from this model offer a possible solution to the paradox of sublethal defenses and provide a mechanism for stable plant-herbivore interactions without the need for natural enenmy control.

Body length shrinkage in an endangered amphibian is associated with drought	JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY												Shrinkage in body length, followed by growth, has rarely been documented in vertebrates and has been associated with stressful energetic and environmental conditions. Here, we document reversible shrinkage in an amphibian for the first time. Jollyville Plateau salamanders Eurycea tonkawae are neotenic (attain maturity while retaining an aquatic larval form) and inhabit springs and caves of a dissected aquifer in Travis County, TX, USA. We conducted mark-recapture surveys on a spring-dwelling population before and after an exceptional drought in 2008. Use of unique marks and digital photographs of individuals provided precise information on salamander growth rates during and after a period in which salamanders retreated to underground refugia to avoid desiccation during the drought. Tail width decreased significantly during the drought indicating a reduction in energy stores, a consequence of stressful environmental conditions. Unexpectedly, body length shrinkage also occurred during the drought and was followed by positive growth when spring flow resumed. Body length shrinkage could be an adaptation to coping with long periods of low food availability although its long-term effects are unknown. Given the influence of body size on many ecological and physiological characteristics of organisms, plasticity in body size may have important consequences that go undetected by researchers if shrinkage is ignored.

Amer Chem Soc				Many of the most potent odorants found in foods contain sulfur. The exceptionally low odor threshold values of many of these compounds mean that only trace quantities are necessary to make a significant contribution to flavor. Heterocyclic sulfur compounds, including thiophenes, thiophenones, dithiolanes, trithiolanes, trithianes, thiazoles, and thienothiophenes, are typical products of thermal reactions in food. Non-heterocyclic sulfur compounds, such as thiols, sulfides and disulfides are also important to the aroma of heated foods. The main source of sulfur in the reactions that lead to these compounds is the amino acid, cysteine. Cysteine degradation, in the Maillard reaction or through hydrolysis, produces hydrogen sulfide, which is a vital reactant for the production of sulfur-containing aroma compounds. Other important sulfur-containing precursors are methionine and thiamin.																	0097-6156		0-8412-3777-8				2002	826						81	100									WOS:000181054000004

But despite advances in biologging technology, obtaining in situ observations of organisms and their interactions remains challenging in the marine environment. For some species of toothed whales, echoes from organisms insonified by echolocation clicks and recorded by sound logging tags have provided a fine-scale view of prey density, and predator and prey behaviour during capture attempts, but such information is not available for marine predators that do not echolocate. Here the development and performance of a miniature biomimetic sonar and movement tag capable of acquiring similar data from non-echolocating marine predators is reported. The tag, weighing 200 g in air, records wide bandwidth sonar data at up to 50 pings a second synchronously with fast-sampling sensors for depth, acceleration, magnetic field and GPS. This sensor suite enables biotic conditions and predator behaviour to be related to geographic location over long-duration foraging trips by apex marine predators. The sonar operates at 1.5 MHz with a 3.4 degrees beamwidth and a source level of 190 dB re 1 mu Pa at 1 m. Sonar recordings from a trial deployment of the tag on a southern elephant seal contained frequent targets corresponding to small organisms up to 6 m ahead of the tagged animal. Synchronously sampled movement data allowed interpretation of whether the seal attempted to capture organisms that it approached closely while the high sonar ping rate revealed attempts by prey to escape. Results from this trial demonstrate the ability of the tag to quantify the biotic environment and to track individual prey captures, providing fine-scale information on predator-prey interactions which has been difficult to obtain from non-echolocating marine animals.

Foraging hotspots of common and roseate terns: the influence of tidal currents, bathymetry, and prey density	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												Foraging seabirds face significant challenges because the distribution of their prey is often patchy and unpredictable. On the other hand, some environmental features do provide more predictable foraging habitats. Successful foragers presumably use both consistent and flexible strategies. However, our understanding of this balance is limited, because simultaneous high-resolution measurements of prey and predator distributions are rarely available. We used a marine radar to map flocks of common terns Sterna hirundo and roseate terns S. dougallii near their breeding colony on Great Gull Island, New York, USA, in 2014 and 2015. We also surveyed the terns' prey, and tidal currents, using acoustic instruments on small boats. Feeding flocks formed most often in areas where water accelerated over shallow topography. These locations were consistent from one tidal cycle to the next, although flocks did not always form there. A spatial generalized linear model for flock density explained 45% of the deviance in their observed distribution. The mean prey density was not significantly different under flocks than elsewhere, and there were no detectable spatial trends in the prey field. Our results show that terns rely on the physical action of tidal currents to make prey available near the surface, and that the spatial and temporal predictability of this process may be more important to them than the absolute density of the prey. These findings quantify important features of tern foraging habitat, and may prove useful for planning human activities (e.g. offshore wind energy facilities) to reduce their impacts on terns.

J	FORTIER, L; LEFEVRE, J; LEGENDRE, L				FORTIER, L; LEFEVRE, J; LEGENDRE, L			EXPORT OF BIOGENIC CARBON TO FISH AND TO THE DEEP-OCEAN - THE ROLE OF LARGE PLANKTONIC MICROPHAGES	JOURNAL OF PLANKTON RESEARCH												The turnover time of biogenic carbon in the ocean can be defined as the time elapsed between the photosynthetic uptake of dissolved inorganic carbon and the return of this carbon as CO2 in surface waters or the atmosphere. Three compartments can be defined: short-lived carbon (<10(-2) year), long-lived carbon (10(-2)-10(2) years) and carbon sequestered in deep water or sediments. Pelagic organisms that package small particles into larger ones lengthen the turnover time of biogenic carbon and, in some cases. transfer this carbon from a given compartment to a longer-lived one. The lengthening of turnover time should be a direct function of the ratio between the size of organisms and that of their food particles. Under some circumstances. large species of euphausiids and copepods, in the North Pacific and the Southern Ocean, contribute to the lengthening of carbon turnover time. However, the most efficient re-packagers of small particles into larger ones are salps, appendicularians, doliolids and thecosome pteropods. which feed on particles at least 3.5 orders of magnitude smaller than their own size. It is hypothesized that the capacity of these large microphages to swarm explosively allows them to control phytoplankton blooms and prevent the development of particle concentrations that could clog their filtering apparatus. Salps. appendicularians and, to some degree, thecosome pteropods are frequent in the diet of some larval and adult fish, and thus contribute to some extent to the direct transformation of short-lived microbial carbon into longer-lived harvestable resources. Yet, the main ecological role of large non-crustacean microphages may reside in the production of fast-sinking, resistant, faecal pellets (in particular those of oceanic salps) that often make up the bulk of the vertical flux of organic material into deep waters, where biogenic carbon can be sequestered for long periods.																	0142-7873	1464-3774				JUL	1994	16	7					809	839		10.1093/plankt/16.7.809							WOS:A1994NZ20000006						
J	Warren, JD; Stanton, TK; McGehee, DE; Chu, DZ				Warren, JD; Stanton, TK; McGehee, DE; Chu, DZ			Effect of animal orientation on acoustic estimates of zooplankton properties	IEEE JOURNAL OF OCEANIC ENGINEERING												It is well known that the behavior of zooplankton and, in particular, their orientation distribution dramatically affects the level of backscattered acoustic energy. As a result, interpretation of acoustic survey data in the ocean is subject to error. In order to quantify these effects, laboratory data from two important classes of animals were collected. The data involved broad-band (350-650 kHz) acoustic signals insonifying individual animals whose orientation was varied over the range 0degrees-360degrees in 1degrees increments. The animals were from two major anatomical groups: fluid-like (decapod shrimp; Palaemonetes vulgaris) and elastic-shelled (periwinkles; Littorina littorea). The data were analyzed both in the time domain (with pulse compression processing) and the frequency domain. Averages of the laboratory data over different orientation distributions illustrate the variability in average target strength that can be expected in the ocean environment. The average target strength of the shrimp varied by 3 dB when averaged over orientation distributions centered around broadside and end-on incidence. In addition, size estimates from pulse compression processing of the broad-band echoes were made for various orientation distributions for both the shrimp and periwinkles. These results show the necessity of animal orientation information for the proper interpretation of acoustic backscatter data.

Revisiting the cost of carnivory in mammals	JOURNAL OF EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY												Predator-prey relationships play a key role in the evolution and ecology of carnivores. An understanding of predator-prey relationships and how this differs across species and environments provides information on how carnivorous strategies have evolved and how they may change in response to environmental change. We aim to determine how mammals overcame the challenges of living within the marine environment; specifically, how this altered predator-prey body mass relationships relative to terrestrial mammals. Using predator and prey mass data collected from the literature, we applied phylogenetic piecewise regressions to investigate the relationship between predator and prey size across carnivorous mammals (51 terrestrial and 56 marine mammals). We demonstrate that carnivorous mammals have four broad dietary groups: small marine carnivores (< 11 000 kg) and small terrestrial carnivores (< 11 kg) feed on prey less than 5 kg and 2 kg, respectively. On average, large marine carnivores (> 11 000 kg) feed on prey equal to 0.01% of the carnivore's body size, compared to 45% or greater in large terrestrial carnivores (> 11 kg). We propose that differences in prey availability, and the relative ease of processing large prey in the terrestrial environment and small prey in marine environment, have led to the evolution of these novel foraging behaviours. Our results provide important insights into the selection pressures that may have been faced by early marine mammals and ultimately led to the evolution of a range of feeding strategies and predatory behaviours.

J	Avila, TR; Machado, AAD; Bianchini, A				Avila, Tatiana Ramos; de Souza Machado, Anderson Abel; Bianchini, Adalto			Chitobiase of planktonic crustaceans from South Atlantic coast (Southern Brazil): Characterization and influence of abiotic parameters on enzyme activity	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY												Chitobiase is one of the enzymes involved in chitin degradation in nature. It is produced and released by a variety of organisms from bacteria to fish. In crustaceans, it is associated with digestive function and acts on the epidermis during the molting process. In the present study, the influence of water pH, temperature and salinity on maximum chitobiase activity (MCA), as well as the enzyme affinity (Km) for a substrate, the methylumbelliferyl N-acetyl-beta-o-glucosaminide (MUFNAG) was evaluated in the copepod Acartia tonsa. Km values for chitobiases of other crustaceans from the Patos Lagoon estuary and Cassino Beach (Southern Brazil) were also determined. For A. tonsa, MCA was observed at pH 5-6 and 30-35 degrees C. The range of pH was quite similar to that reported for other aquatic organisms. However, the range of temperature was lower than that previously reported. For salinity, no previous studies have considered the influence of this parameter on MCA. For A. tonsa, MCA was observed in freshwater, showing a significant linear decrease with increasing salinity. Considering that maximum copepod survival and growth rates are observed between 15 and 25 ppt, these findings suggest that the observed enzyme activity in this range of salinity (68 to 47% of that measured in freshwater) is not a limiting factor for A. tonsa growth. However, the extremely decreased enzyme activity observed in salinity 30 ppt (33% of that measured in freshwater) suggests that chitobiase activity might be one of the limiting factor for copepod growth at 30 ppt salinity or higher. Km values (mu M) determined for organisms evaluated in the present study (copepod A. tonsa = 20.77; mysid Metamysidopsis elongata atlantica = 14.67; nauplii barnacle Balanus improvisus = 18.19; decapod zoea = 14.30; decapod megalopa = 24.77) were lower than those reported for other crustaceans from Northern Hemisphere. Also, they were much lower than those of organisms from different taxonomic groups like bacteria and fungi, but much higher than in protozoans and dinoflagelates. These findings suggest that chitobiase might be differentially evolved in each specific group of organism, and even within different ontogenetic stages of the same species, for a better adaptation to cope with its respective environmental needs.

Monocultures of 12 nanoplankton taxa of different cell size and 1 species of Thalassiosira (microplankton) were offered to Nyctiphanes australis to determine whether they would be consumed and, if so, determine rates of clearance and ingestion by the euphausiid. N. australis ingested very small cells (3.5 to 5.4 mum equivalent spherical diameter) at rates less than or equal to 5 x 10(5) cells h(-1). A total of 8 nanoplankton taxa were consumed at rates that provided N. australis with its minimum food requirement of 2% body carbon d(-1), and so could maintain it when microplankton abundance is low. Our results suggest that N, australis can detect and avoid unpalatable food such as the chlorophytes Dunaliella and Nannochloris, but is susceptible to the toxic dinoflagellate Alexandrium minutum.																	0171-8630						2003	253						209	216		10.3354/meps253209							WOS:000183487200019

Multibeam echosounders (MBES) deployed on autonomous underwater vehicles represent a promising technology for monitoring this elusive fauna at relatively high spatial and temporal resolution. However, application of this remote-sensing technology to the study of small (relative to the sampling resolution), dispered and mobile animals at depth does not come without significant challenges with respect to data collection, data processing and vessel avoidance. As a proof of concept, we used data from a downward-looking RESON SeaBat 7125 MBES mounted on a Dorado-class AUV to detect and characterise the location and movement of backscattering targets (which were likely to have been individual fish or squid) within 50 m of the seafloor at -800 m similar to depth in Monterey Bay, California. The targets were detected and tracked, enabling their numerical density and movement to be characterised. The results revealed aconsistent movement of targets downwards away from the AUV that we interpreted as an avoidance response. The large volume and complexity of the data presented a computational challenge, while reverberation and noise, spatial confounding and a marginal sampling resolution relative to the size of the targets caused difficulties for reliable and comprehensive target detection and tracking. Nevertheless, the results demonstrate that an AUV-mounted MBES has the potential to proide unique and detailed information on the in situ abundance, distribution, size and behaviour of both individual and aggregated deep-sea benthopelagic animals. We provide detailed data-processing information for thse interested in working with MBES water-column data, and a critical appraisal of the data in the context of aquatic ecosystem research. We consider future directions for deep-sea water-column echosounding, and renforce the importance of measures to mitigate vessel avoidance in studies of aquatic ecosystems.

In this paper, the effects of mercuric ion on the activity of NAGase from Penaeus vannamei for the hydrolysis of pNP-NAG have been studied. The results show that HgCl2 can lead to irreversible inactivation to this enzyme. The inactivation process follows a first-order reaction and the inactivation rate constants have been determined. The relationship between the inactivation rate constants and HgCl2 concentration has been studied and the result shows that only one molecule of HgCl2 binds to the enzyme molecule to lead the enzyme lose its activity. Moreover, the conformational changes of the enzyme inactivated by HgCl2 were studied by following changes in the intrinsic fluorescence emission and ultraviolet absorption spectra.

As expected, the North Sea shrimps Crangon crangon and Crangon allmani showed in their midgut glands high proteolytic activities. However, the majority of animals lacked trypsin and chymotrypsin. Conversely, a minority of about 10% of the animals had elevated trypsin activities. The appearance of trypsin was neither related to the mode of feeding nor to the nutritive state of the animals. When present, trypsin was expressed in both species as a single isoform of apparently 20 kDa. The lack of serine proteinases was also confirmed by inhibitor assays. AEBSF, a serine proteinase inhibitor, slightly reduced total proteinase activity by less than 10%. In contrast E 64, a cysteine proteinase inhibitor, caused a reduction of more than 70% of total proteinase activity, indicating that a substantial share of proteolytic activity is caused by cysteine proteinases. Cathepsin L-like proteinases were identified as major cysteine proteinases. A comparison with the eucarid crustaceans Pandalus montagui, Pagurus bernhardus, Cancer pagurus and Euphausia superba showed a similar high level of total proteinase activity in all species. Trypsin, however, varied significantly between species showing lowest activities in Caridea and the highest activity in E. superba. E 64 suppressed total proteinase activity by more than 70% in Crangon species but not in C. pagurus and E. superba. In contrast, the serine proteinase inhibitor AEBSF had only little effect in Caridea but was most effective in P. bernhardus, C. pagurus and E. superba. The results may indicate different traits of food utilization strategies in some eucarid crustaceans. Caridea may express predominantly cysteine proteinase, while in Anomura, Brachyura and Euphausiacea, serine proteinases may prevail. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Tao, ZC; Li, CL; Sun, S				Tao, Zhencheng; Li, Chaolun; Sun, Song			Grazing and Metabolism of Euphausia pacifica in the Yellow Sea	PLOS ONE												Grazing and metabolism of Euphausia pacifica in the Yellow Sea were studied from September 2006 to August 2007. Euphausia pacifica is a selective-feeding omnivore and grazing rates among different months were monitored using a Coulter Counter and batch culture feeding experiments. Euphausia pacifica mainly grazed microzooplankton in August and September, which resulted in an increase in chlorophyll a concentration. Oxygen consumption rate of E. pacifica was 38.7-42.5 mu mol O-2 g(-1) DW h(-1) in March, which was four times higher than the oxygen consumption rates in September and December. The vigorous metabolism of E. pacifica in March consumed 3.1% of body carbon daily, which is likely related to its high reproduction and grazing rate. Respiration and metabolism of E. pacifica in September and December were similar and were lower. O:N ratio of E. pacifica was the highest (17.3-23.8) in March when spawning activity occurred and when food was abundant. The energetic source of E. pacifica during September and December was mostly protein from eating a carnivorous diet, including such items as microzooplankton. Euphausia pacifica was found in cold water at the bottom of the Yellow Sea in summer and autumn and maintained a low consumption status. O: N ratios of E. pacifica in March, September, and December were negatively correlated with SSTs and no significant correlation was found between O: N ratios and chlorophyll a concentration. Seawater temperature is clearly the most important parameter influencing the metabolism of E. pacifica.

The steam distillate of cultured tiger prawn contained a greater number of sulfur-containing compounds including dimethyl disulfide, isopropyl thiophene, cis-and trans-3,5-dimethyl-1 ,2,4-trithiolane, 2-acetyl-and benzo-thiazole, 3,5,6-trimethyl-1,2,4-dithiazine and 2,6-dimethyl-4-butyl-1,3,5 dihydrodithiazine. Increased distillation time resulted in increased H2S formation in a semilogarithmic correlation. Reaction of cysteine and glucose in phosphate buffer produced 1-methylthio-2-propanone and gave an aroma approximating that of canned tuna in oil. Fresh fish aroma was obtained by lipoxygenase-catalyzed dioxygenation of highly unsaturated fatty acids, C-20:5 and C-22:6, and commercial fish oil. A scheme of reactions responsible for the formation of fresh seafood aroma is proposed.																	0097-6156	1947-5918	0-8412-3526-0				1997	674						64	75									WOS:A1997BJ90T00007

Prey Patch Patterns Predict Habitat Use by Top Marine Predators with Diverse Foraging Strategies	PLOS ONE												Spatial coherence between predators and prey has rarely been observed in pelagic marine ecosystems. We used measures of the environment, prey abundance, prey quality, and prey distribution to explain the observed distributions of three co-occurring predator species breeding on islands in the southeastern Bering Sea: black-legged kittiwakes (Rissa tridactyla), thick-billed murres (Uria lomvia), and northern fur seals (Callorhinus ursinus). Predictions of statistical models were tested using movement patterns obtained from satellite-tracked individual animals. With the most commonly used measures to quantify prey distributions - areal biomass, density, and numerical abundance - we were unable to find a spatial relationship between predators and their prey. We instead found that habitat use by all three predators was predicted most strongly by prey patch characteristics such as depth and local density within spatial aggregations. Additional prey patch characteristics and physical habitat also contributed significantly to characterizing predator patterns. Our results indicate that the small-scale prey patch characteristics are critical to how predators perceive the quality of their food supply and the mechanisms they use to exploit it, regardless of time of day, sampling year, or source colony. The three focal predator species had different constraints and employed different foraging strategies - a shallow diver that makes trips of moderate distance (kittiwakes), a deep diver that makes trip of short distances (murres), and a deep diver that makes extensive trips (fur seals). However, all three were similarly linked by patchiness of prey rather than by the distribution of overall biomass. This supports the hypothesis that patchiness may be critical for understanding predator-prey relationships in pelagic marine systems more generally.

A Bayesian approach to estimating target strength	ICES JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE					ICES Symposium on the Ecosystem Approach to Fisheries Acoutics and Complementary Technologies	JUN 16-20, 2008	Bergen, NORWAY	ICES				Currently, conventional models of target strength (TS) vs. fish length, based on empirical measurements, are used to estimate fish density from integrated acoustic data. These models estimate a mean TS, averaged over variables that modulate fish TS (tilt angle, physiology, and morphology); they do not include information about the uncertainty of the mean TS, which could be propagated through to estimates of fish abundance. We use Bayesian methods, together with theoretical TS models and in situ TS data, to determine the uncertainty in TS estimates of Atlantic herring (Clupea harengus). Priors for model parameters (surface swimbladder volume, tilt angle, and s.d. of the mean TS) were used to estimate posterior parameter distributions and subsequently build a probabilistic TS model. The sensitivity of herring abundance estimates to variation in the Bayesian TS model was also evaluated. The abundance of North Sea herring from the area covered by the Scottish acoustic survey component was estimated using both the conventional TS-length formula (5.34x10(9) fish) and the Bayesian TS model (mean = 3.17x10(9) fish): this difference was probably because of the particular scattering model employed and the data used in the Bayesian model. The study demonstrates the relative importance of potential bias and precision of TS estimation and how the latter can be so much less important than the former.

Their size, locomotive domain, population, and the environmental stimuli guiding motion make challenging the study of member interactions and global behaviors. In this review, we borrow principles and analogies from fluids to describe the characteristics of organismal aggregations, which may inspire new tools for the analysis of collective motion. Examples of fluid resemblance include open channel flow, droplet formation, and particle-laden flow. We show how the properties of density, viscosity, and surface tension have strong parallels in the structure and behavior of aggregations of contrasting scale and domain. In certain cases, aggregations are sufficiently fluid-like that values can be assigned to such properties. We highlight how organisms engaging in collective motion can flow, roll, and change phase. Finally, we present limitations and exceptions for the application of fluidic principles to the motion of living groups.

Icarus			Impact of zooplankton food selectivity on plankton dynamics and nutrient cycling	JOURNAL OF PLANKTON RESEARCH												Within models, zooplankton grazing is typically defined as being dependent on total prey concentration, with feeding selectivity expressed only as a function of prey size. This behavior ignores taxonomic preferences shown by the predators and the capacity of some zooplankton to actively select or reject individual prey items from mixtures. We carried out two model experiments comparing impacts of zooplankton displaying passive and active selection, which resulted in contrasting dynamics for the pelagic system. Passive selection by the grazer resulted in a top down control on the prey with a fast turn-over of nutrients. Active selection, on the other hand led to a bottom-up control, with slower nutrient turnover constraining primary production by changing the system toward export of particulate matter. Our results suggest that selective feeding behavior is an important trait, and should be considered alongside size and taxonomy when studying the role of zooplankton impact in the ecosystem.

For the thorough hydrolysis of the proteins to free the Se species, bay scallop tissues were pre-treated (pre-hydrolyzed) with papain in a 1 mol L-1 sodium bicarbonate solution containing 5 mmol L-1 sodium thiosulfate at 30-40 degrees C for 24 h, then hydrolyzed by the combination of Flavourzyme (R) 500 L. carboxypeptidase Y and trypsin (3 + I + I) at 45 degrees C, at a constant pH of 8.00 for 6 h. Under the optimized conditions, the quantification limits of MeSeCys, SeCys(2) , SeMet, SeO32- and SeO42- were 0.69, 0.48, 0.93 0.53 and 1.22 mu g L-1, respectively (equivalent to 0.14, 0.097, 0.19, 0.11 and 0.24 gg-1 for real samples).The working curves in the concentration ranges of 2 to 500 pg L-1 were linear with all the RSD (n = 5) smaller than 15% and regression coefficients greater than 0.999. The recoveries of the species for spiked samples at 4 mu g g(-1) (equivalent to 20 mu g L-1 in the final hydrolyzates) levels all exceeded 90%. The developed method was validated by the determination of SeMet in SELM-1, a Se enriched yeast certified reference material (CRM). Selenate was the only absent species, whereas the other four species did exist in bay scallops. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Estimation of biological parameters of marine organisms using linear and nonlinear acoustic scattering model-based inversion methods	JOURNAL OF THE ACOUSTICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA												The linear inversion commonly used in fisheries and zooplankton acoustics assumes a constant inversion kernel and ignores the uncertainties associated with the shape and behavior of the scattering targets, as well as other relevant animal parameters. Here, errors of the linear inversion due to uncertainty associated with the inversion kernel are quantified. A scattering model-based nonlinear inversion method is presented that takes into account the nonlinearity of the inverse problem and is able to estimate simultaneously animal abundance and the parameters associated with the scattering model inherent to the kernel. It uses sophisticated scattering models to estimate first, the abundance, and second, the relevant shape and behavioral parameters of the target organisms. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the abundance, size, and behavior (tilt angle) parameters of marine animals (fish or zooplankton) can be accurately inferred from the inversion by using multi-frequency acoustic data. The influence of the singularity and uncertainty in the inversion kernel on the inversion results can be mitigated by examining the singular values for linear inverse problems and employing a non-linear inversion involving a scattering model-based kernel.

M. Skip			Simultaneous determination of arsenic and selenium species in fish tissues using microwave-assisted enzymatic extraction and ion chromatography-inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry	TALANTA												A microwave-assisted enzymatic extraction (MAEE) method was developed for the simultaneous extraction or arsenic (As) and selenium (Se) species in fish tissues. The extraction efficiency of total As and Se and the stability of As and Se species were evaluated by analyzing DOLT-3 (dogfish liver). Enzymatic extraction using pronase E/lipase mixture assisted by microwave energy was found to give satisfactory extraction recoveries for As and Se without promoting interspecies conversion. The optimum extraction conditions were found to be 0.2 g of sample, 20 mg pronase E and 5 mg lipase in 10 mL of 50 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7.25 at 37 degrees C. The total extraction time was 30 min. The speciation analysis was performed by ion chromatography-Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (IC-ICP-MS). The accuracy of the developed extraction procedure was verified by analyzing two reference materials, DOLT-3 and BCR-627. The extraction recoveries in those reference materials ranged between 82 and 94% for As and 57 and 97% for Se. The accuracy of arsenic species measurement was tested by the analysis of BCR 627. The proposed method was applied to determine As and Se species in fish tissues purchased from a local fish market. Arsenobetaine (AsB) and selenomethionine (SeMet) were the major species detected in fish tissues. In the analyzed fish extracts, the sum of As species detected was in good agreement with the total As extracted. However, for Se, the sum of its species was lower than the total Se extracted, revealing the presence of Se-containing peptides or proteins. (c) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Most attention has so far been paid to seasonal effects but little is known about regional variability. Metabolic activity (expressed by respiration and excretion rates) and physiological state (expressed by reproductive effort and moult activity) in Euphausia hanseni were examined at different stations during austral summer (minimum upwelling) and austral winter (maximum upwelling). Overall, regional differences in physiological state, influencing metabolic activity, were greater than seasonal ones, indicating favourable conditions for growth and reproduction year-round. Higher respiration rates were found for females in more advanced stages of sexual development. Moult stage did not affect oxygen consumption rates, however. The physiological state of E. hanseni at the time of capture may serve as a meaningful indicator of the associated hydrographic conditions in the NBUS, to be further used in eco-system analysis on seasonal or long-term time scales. A latitudinal comparison of species highlights the extraordinary physiological plasticity of euphausiids. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Measuring the enzyme activity is an interesting manner to monitor the moult process at sub-individual level, complementary to the classical observation of the integument morphogenesis, ecdysis success, or moult cycle duration. The present study aimed to optimise the methodology of using N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase (NAGase) activity to monitor moulting in the marine prawn Palaemon serratus, and to compare NAGase activity levels along the moult cycle of both male and female specimens. First, to optimise protocols for five different organs, different reaction medium compositions were tested, considering the type buffer, concentration of the substrate, and the load in enzymatic extract. Second, levels of NAGase activity were closely monitored during eight moulting stages in male prawns. Variations in NAGase activity were observed during the moult cycle, with an increase in activity in the late premoult phase of approximately 2.4-fold the level of the intermoult phase.

J	Horne, JK; Clay, CS				Horne, JK; Clay, CS			Sonar systems and aquatic organisms: matching equipment and model parameters	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												Acoustic technology is an accepted and important component of aquatic research and resource management. Despite the widespread use of echosounders, few guidelines aid in the choice of appropriate sonar system parameters for acoustic surveys. Choice of acoustic carrier frequency is analogous to the choice of spotlight colour used to illuminate a painting. Three primary biological factors influence the scattering of sound by aquatic organisms: swimbladder presence, organism length. and organism behaviour. We illustrate the influence of these factors on the amplitude of backscattered echoes using a Kirchhoff-ray mode scattering model to quantify fish and zooplankton backscatter as a function of carrier frequency, fish length, and swimbladder aspect. Model results illustrate that echo amplitudes from aquatic organisms are largely dependent on the presence or absence of a swimbladder. Target strengths generally increase with increasing carrier frequency and organism length. Swimbladder angle relative to the incident sound wave affects scattering amplitudes at all frequencies. Measurements of backscatter from swimbladdered fish are relatively robust when the ratio of fish length to acoustic frequency wavelength ranges between 2 and 10. As fish length to frequency wavelength ratios increase, echo amplitudes become more dependent on aspect and peak when the swimbladder is perpendicular to the acoustic wavefront.

Lipofuscin concentration in the left olfactory lobe cell mass of the brain was measured using image analysis of fluorescence micrographs. Age predictions based on lipofuscin concentration were more accurate and had narrower 95% confidence limits than those derived from the more conventional body size and weight predictors for all age groups tested (180, 300, 420, 780 d). Overall, use of lipofuscin concentration produced a significantly lower (p < 0.001) mean age-prediction error (16.65%)than use of carapace length or body weight (32.45 and 32.3%, respectively). Carapace length was of little value for prediction of the age of older individuals. Mathematical models defining the relationships between temperature, age and lipofuscin accumulation were derived from laboratory-reared individuals. These models did not describe adequately the course of lipofuscin accumulation in crayfish from the field over the whole lifespan. Field data from three ''known'' year-classes were used to generate simulated size-frequency and lipofuscin concentration-frequency histograms. Year-classes in the lipofuscin concentration frequency-histogram were much more easily distinguished than in the size-frequency histogram. Under field conditions, lipofuscin concentration was a better predictor of chronological age than conventional morphometric measures.																	0025-3162					DEC	1994	121	2					237	245		10.1007/BF00346731							WOS:A1994PZ81100005						
J	Fauchald, P; Erikstad, KE				Fauchald, P; Erikstad, KE			Scale-dependent predator-prey interactions: the aggregative response of seabirds to prey under variable prey abundance and patchiness	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												The aggregative response of seabirds to their prey has frequently been measured through their spatial coherence during ship board surveys. In this study, we investigate the aggregative response of murres Uria spp. to capelin Mallotus villosus in relation to yearly changes in capelin abundance and patchiness from a 9 yr data set collected in the Barents Sea. A recent analysis on the spatial distribution of capelin and murres in the Barents Sea reported a hierarchical patch structure, whereby small-scale patches were nested within patches at larger scales. In the present study we carry out similar analyses for each of the 9 years. During the 9 yr period, the estimated total biomass of capelin varied between 100 000 and 7 300 000 t. We identified 2 hierarchical levels of patchiness with characteristic scales of 200 to 300 km and 70 km respectively. We found close relationships between yearly variation in capelin abundance, capelin patchiness and the concordance between capelin and murres at both levels. The patchiness of capelin, as measured by the first-order spatial autocorrelation, increased with increasing capelin abundance at the large-scale level, and there was a similar tendency at the small-scale level. At the large-scale level, the spatial concordance between murres and capelin increased with both increasing capelin density and increasing capelin patchiness. At the small-scale level, the concordance between murres and capelin increased with increasing capelin patchiness. Our results suggest that increased prey patchiness and increased prey abundance enhance the possibility of murres finding satisfactory capelin concentrations. The reduction in prey patchiness with low prey abundance might force predators to switch to other prey items, and might therefore have a stabilizing effect on predator-prey interactions.

Drivers of euphausiid species abundance and numerical abundance in the Atlantic Ocean	MARINE BIOLOGY												Mid-ocean ridges are common features of the world's oceans but there is a lack of understanding as to how their presence affects overlying pelagic biota. The Mid-Atlantic Ridge (MAR) is a dominant feature of the Atlantic Ocean. Here, we examined data on euphausiid distribution and abundance arising from several international research programmes and from the continuous plankton recorder. We used a generalized additive model (GAM) framework to explore spatial patterns of variability in euphausiid distribution on, and at either side of, the MAR from 60A degrees N to 55A degrees S in conjunction with variability in a suite of biological, physical and environmental parameters. Euphausiid species abundance peaked in mid-latitudes and was significantly higher on the ridge than in adjacent waters, but the ridge did not influence numerical abundance significantly. Sea surface temperature (SST) was the most important single factor influencing both euphausiid numerical abundance and species abundance. Increases in sea surface height variance, a proxy for mixing, increased the numerical abundance of euphausiids. GAM predictions of variability in species abundance as a function of SST and depth of the mixed layer were consistent with present theories, which suggest that pelagic niche availability is related to the thermal structure of the near surface water: more deeply-mixed water contained higher euphausiid biodiversity. In addition to exposing present distributional patterns, the GAM framework enables responses to potential future and past environmental variability including temperature change to be explored.

A distorted wave Born approximation target strength model for Bering Sea euphausiids	ICES JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE												Acoustic surveys monitor euphausiid populations in the Bering Sea because of their importance as prey for walleye pollock and other organisms. Various scattering models exist to convert acoustic backscatter data to estimates of euphausiid numerical density or biomass, but a target strength (TS) model specific to Bering Sea euphausiids has not been available. This study parameterized a distorted wave Born approximation (DWBA) scattering model using physical (length and body shape) and material (density contrast, g, and sound speed contrast, h) properties measured from live euphausiids. All model parameters (length, shape, material properties, orientation) were evaluated for their effect on predicted TS. A polynomial function was used to describe animal shape and produced smaller TS estimates compared to a taper function, as is traditionally used in DWBA scattering models of euphausiids. Animal length was positively correlated with TS, but variations in other parameters (including material properties and orientation) also produced large changes in TS. Large differences in TS between estimates calculated using measured versus literature material property values caused large variations in acoustic estimates of euphausiid numerical densities (animals m 23) which emphasizes the importance of collecting site-specific g and h measurements when possible.

Zooplankton occur throughout the water column. and are exposed to a range of hydrostatic pressures throughout their lifetime. The hydrostatic pressure apparatus developed in this study makes it possible to (i) increase pressure gradually from 1 to 200 atm, (ii) prevent corrosion of the pressure chamber by introducing a specimen holder that separates the pressure chamber from the surrounding seawater, and (iii) observe a wide size range of zooplankton. including eggs (100-10 000 mu m size range). The new apparatus is useful for the study of mesozooplankton throughout their life history from egg to adult. The effects of hydrostatic pressure on the eggs of the calanoid copepod, Calanus sinicus, were examined using the new hydrostatic pressure apparatus. Hydrostatic pressure did not affect C. sinicus egg development time, but egg-hatching success decreased significantly, with increasing pressure. Most of the nauplii that hatched under high-pressure conditions (101, 501, and 100 atm) were deformed. Eggs of C. sinicus did tolerate pressures of 10 atm. This implies that eggs would not survive if they did not hatch within the upper 100 m.

Both species are carnivorous and prey on mesozooplankton. They represent a substantial food source for marine vertebrates and are a key link between zooplankton secondary production and higher trophic levels. We present data on the total lipid content, lipid class and fatty acid composition of T. libellula and T. abyssorum from northern Fram Strait and the central Arctic Ocean. Both species had moderate to high lipid contents of 14-42% of body dry mass. In T. abyssorum, total lipid content was correlated to body mass, while T. libellula showed sex-related differences in lipid content. Despite their smaller body size, females of T. libellula had higher lipid contents than males. Wax esters represented the major lipid class in both species with 41-43% of total lipid, while triacylglycerols contributed 23-32%. The fatty acid composition was dominated by the long-chain polyunsaturated moieties 20:5(n-3) and 22:6(n-3), short-chain saturated compounds (16:0 and 14:0) and monounsaturated fatty acids of varying length, i.e. 16:1(n-7), 20:1(n-9), 18:1(n-9) and 22:1(n-11). Species-specific and geographic variations in the fatty acid and alcohol patterns were apparently linked to differences in diet and life-cycle. High amounts of the fatty acids and alcohols 20:1(n-9) and 22:1(n-11) in T. libellula indicate predation on herbivorous Calanus copepodids. In addition. elevated levels of 20:5(n-3) in T. libellula indicate a close connection with ice-algal production and the importance of cryo-pelagic coupling processes (i.e. exchange processes between the sea ice and the pelagic communities) for the nutrition of this high-Arctic epipelagic species. In contrast, T. abyssorum is characterised by lower amounts of 20:5(n-3) and its biomarker ratios indicate a higher trophic level. This observation is consistent with the subarctic-boreal origin of T. abyssorum and its occurrence in deeper layers of the Arctic Ocean. where it may feed on omnivorous and/or carnivorous prey.

Here, we combine multifrequency acoustic survey methods, physics-based models of euphausiid backscatter, and net sampling to provide a means of monitoring the status and trends of euphausiid standing stock biomass on the Bering Sea shelf. Observations made using this approach during six summers (2004 and 2006-2010) indicate that standing stocks of euphausiids and pollock were inversely correlated over time as well as in space across the continental shelf. First-order calculations show that when pollock abundance was at its peak during these years, the pollock stock could have consumed 10-87% of the euphausiid standing stock between May and September. We hypothesize that predation by pollock is a significant top-down control on euphausiid standing stock in this system. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

We introduce a novel Bayesian method that can be used to quantify this relationship when the only data available are size-frequency distributions of unmarked individuals measured at two successive time periods. The inverse Gaussian distribution provides a parametric form for the statistical model development, and we use Markov chain Monte Carlo methods to evaluate posterior distributions. We illustrate the method using data on threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) collected before and after the winter season in an Alaskan lake. Our method allows us to compare the intensity of size-biased mortality in different years.

Material properties of Northeast Pacific zooplankton	ICES JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE												We measured the density and sound speed contrasts relative to seawater of Northeast Pacific zooplankton. The density contrast (g) was measured for euphausiids, decapods (Sergestes similis), amphipods (Primno macropa, Phronima sp., and Hyperiid spp.), siphonophore bracts, chaetognaths, larval fish, crab megalopae, larval squid, and medusae. Morphometric data (length, width, and height) were collected for these taxa. Density contrasts varied within and between zooplankton taxa. The mean and standard deviation (s.d.) for euphausiid density contrast were 1.059 +/- 0.009. Relationships between zooplankton density contrast and morphometric measurements, geographic location, and environmental conditions were investigated. Site had a significant effect on euphausiid density contrast. Density contrasts of euphausiids collected in the same geographic area similar to 4-10 d apartwere significantly higher (p < 0.001). Sound speed contrast (h) was measured for euphausiids and pelagic decapods (S. similis) and it varied between taxa. The mean and s.d. for euphausiid sound speed were 1.019 +/- 0.009. Euphausiid mass was calculated from measured density and volume, and a relationship between euphausiid mass and length was produced. We determined that euphausiid volume could be accurately estimated from two-dimensional measurements of animal body shape, and that biomass (or biovolume) could be accurately calculated from digital photographs of animals. Data from this study can improve the accuracy of theoretical acoustic scattering models for these taxa, resulting in more accurate estimates of zooplankton biomass in this region.

Estimating juvenile copepod growth rates: corrections, inter-comparisons and recommendations	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												The 2 most common experimental methods used to estimate rates of juvenile growth in marine copepods are the molt rate (MR) method, and the artificial cohort (AC) method. Recently, we showed the equations used in the MR method to be incorrect, and proposed a modified molt rate (MMR) method. Here, using statistical and model approaches, we compare the AC and MMR methods under various scenarios to quantify their errors. Although the AC and MMR methods both use a combination of field sampling and simulated in situ incubations to estimate somatic growth, they differ in several important characteristics. The AC method determines growth by the change in mean weight during incubation. Mean weight of copepods in the samples can be determined directly, or inferred from mean weight by life stage or from length-weight regressions. We show that substantial error is avoided only if weights are measured directly (AC(direct)). The AC(direct) method is insensitive to variable age within stage due to mortality or variable recruitment in the sampled population, an important advantage over the MMR method. However, the ACdirect method is sensitive to variation in growth rate (luring incubation, which does not affect the MMR method. We therefore recommend that most experimental estimates of growth rate should apply the ACdi,,ct method, with the MMR as a suitable alternative provided its biases are considered. An indirect method based on life stage is biased and we no longer recommend it, and an indirect method based on length-weight regression provides an intermediate level of bias.

J	Fielding, S; Griffiths, G; Roe, HSJ				Fielding, S; Griffiths, G; Roe, HSJ			The biological validation of ADCP acoustic backscatter through direct comparison with net samples and model predictions based on acoustic-scattering models	ICES JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE												Mean volume-backscattering strength (MVBS) data collected using a 153-kHz, narrowband Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP) were compared with zooplankton abundance and biovolume data collected using a Longhurst-Hardy Plankton Recorder (LHPR). A direct comparison showed that there was a linear relationship between MVBS and log-transformed zooplankton dry weight. This linear relationship, determined from a mixed zooplankton-species population, was then compared with that reported in previous work from a region dominated by a single species of copepod and found to be significantly different. The scatter around the linear relationships determined between MVBS and log-transformed dry weights in regions of complex, mixed zooplankton populations results in our inability to distinguish different relationships that could be expected from different populations in varying oceanic regions. It is suggested that, without further manipulation of the data, ADCP MVBS cannot be used to determine quantitative estimates of zooplankton abundance and biomass in mixed populations. "Observed MVBS" was compared with model-predicted backscattering, calculated using acoustic models and abundance and size measurements of zooplankton from net samples. The results show that at high backscattering intensities (>-80 dB) the observed MVBS from an ADCP was generally consistent with the model predictions. Abundance, biovolume, and model-predicted backscattering contributions of six "significant acoustic-scattering" groups (amphipods, chaetognaths, copepods, euphausiids, fish, and pteropods) are shown to vary disproportionately. In particular, a rare and small but strong acoustic scatterer such as a pteropod can contribute as little as 0.1% to the total sample abundance and 0.1% to the biovolume but represent 69.5% of the total model-predicted backscattering. Model, instrumental, and methodological artefacts are identified as potential sources of inconsistencies between the observed and model-predicted backscattering. These include the effect of the orientation of zooplankton, inadequate knowledge of model parameters such as the sound-speed and density contrasts, the mismatch between sampling volumes of the net and acoustic instrument, and net avoidance by the more mobile scatterers.

J	Chu, DZ; Wiebe, P; Copley, N				Chu, DZ; Wiebe, P; Copley, N			Inference of material properties of zooplankton from acoustic and resistivity measurements	ICES JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE												A laboratory apparatus has been developed and used to infer the sound speed and density contrasts of live zooplankton. The sound speed contrast is determined from acoustic measurements of travel time (time-of-flight) and from the resistivity measurements of volume fraction. The density can then be inferred by applying the phase-compensated distorted wave born approximation (DWBA) model based on the attenuation measurement. For the decapod shrimp (Palaemonetes vulgaris), the inferred sound speed contrast found by using three different methods, namely the two-phase ray model (time average), the compressibility model (Wood's equation), and the DWBA model (scattering theory), is quite consistent, while the inferred density contrast agrees with the measured density reasonably well. The influence of ambient pressure on the sound speed and density contrasts has also been measured using a pressure vessel. The results indicate that the density contrast remains essentially unchanged under different pressure, but the sound speed contrast increases about 2.0% with pressure changing from 0 dbar to about 350 dbar. Although this 2.0% change in sound speed contrast only causes a moderate change in estimating biomass for a decapod shrimp, it could cause a much larger bias for weaker scatterers with the same amount of change in sound speed contrast (up to 20 dB). The most important advantage of this newly developed material properties measuring system is its potential applicability to the in situ determination of acoustic properties of zooplankton.

We collected 3 species from the Porcupine Seabight and Porcupine Abyssal Plain, NE Atlantic, between 800 and 4850 m in August 2001 (summer), March 2002 (pre-spring bloom), and October 2002 (autumn). Of these, 2 species, the abyssal Amperima rosea and the bathyal Bathyplotes natans, showed significant variations in fatty acid compositions. These are likely to be seasonal. Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) were dominant within muscle tissue of both species during August 2001 and October 2002, in particular 20:4 (n-6), 20:5 (n-3) and 22:6 (n-3). During March 2002, prior to the spring bloom, there were substantially lower proportions of PUFAs in both species, and increased amounts of mono-unsaturated fatty acids (monoenes), particularly the bacterially-derived biomarkers 18:1 (n-7) and non-methyl uninterrupted dienes (NMIDs). In contrast, the fatty acid composition of the third species, the abyssal Deima validum, remained relatively stable, with muscle tissue containing a high proportion of PUFAs during pre- and post-spring-bloom periods. A further 6 species were sampled in March 2002 and October 2002. Across all these species, 3 patterns of fatty composition were evident: (1) Laetmogone violacea had higher proportions of PUFAs in October than in March; (2) Psychropotes longicauda and Benthogone rosea had lower proportions of PUFAs in October than in March; (3) Deima validum, Oneirophanta mutabilis, Paroriza pallens and P. prouhoi had unchanged fatty acid compositions during these contrasting periods. These differences may be related to the varying reproductive strategies of the species. The implications of changes in fatty acids for reproductive processes, and how these could be factors determining allocation of lipid resources in gonads, is discussed.

Acoustic backscattering from mysids was highest at 430 kHz and lowest at 38 kHz ( 19 dB lower). Maximum difference between the four other frequencies was 5.2 dB. Mysid target strength (TS) ranged from -80.1 dB at 430 kHz to -99.4 dB at 38 kHz ( 12 mm average length, range 5-21 mm). A theoretical scattering model (Stanton's fluid-like, bent-cylinder model) predicted TS within 0.3-1.9 dB of observed TS for the different frequencies. The detection range was lowest at 38 and 710 kHz and greatest at 120 and 200 kHz. Fish were common above the mysid layer and produced higher acoustic backscattering at 38 kHz than at the other frequencies. A combination of 38 kHz and 120 or 200 kHz provides a strong contrast between mysid and fish acoustic backscattering that would help separate these groups using acoustic data.

A pragmatic approach to the analysis of diets of generalist predators: the use of next-generation sequencing with no blocking probes	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY RESOURCES												Predicting whether a predator is capable of affecting the dynamics of a prey species in the field implies the analysis of the complete diet of the predator, not simply rates of predation on a target taxon. Here, we employed the Ion Torrent next-generation sequencing technology to investigate the diet of a generalist arthropod predator. A complete dietary analysis requires the use of general primers, but these will also amplify the predator unless suppressed using a blocking probe. However, blocking probes can potentially block other species, particularly if they are phylogenetically close. Here, we aimed to demonstrate that enough prey sequence could be obtained without blocking probes. In communities with many predators, this approach obviates the need to design and test numerous blocking primers, thus making analysis of complex community food webs a viable proposition. We applied this approach to the analysis of predation by the linyphiid spider Oedothorax fuscus in an arable field. We obtained over two million raw reads. After discarding the low-quality and predator reads, the libraries still contained over 61000 prey reads (3% of the raw reads; 6% of reads passing quality control). The libraries were rich in Collembola, Lepidoptera, Diptera and Nematoda. They also contained sequences derived from several spider species and from horticultural pests (aphids). Oedothorax fuscus is common in UK cereal fields, and the results showed that it is exploiting a wide range of prey. Next-generation sequencing using general primers but without blocking probes provided ample sequences for analysis of the prey range of this spider and proved to be a simple and inexpensive approach.

Drivers of variability in Euphausiid species abundance throughout the Pacific Ocean	JOURNAL OF PLANKTON RESEARCH												Using a generalized additive model, we assessed the influence of a suite of physical, chemical and biological variables upon euphausiid species abundance throughout the Pacific. We found that the main drivers of species abundance, in order of decreasing importance, were sea surface temperature (explaining 29.53% of species variability), salinity (20.29%), longitude (-15.01%, species abundance decreased from West to East), distance to coast (10.99%) and dissolved silicate concentration (9.03%). We discuss the influence of these variables within the context of the known ecology and biology of euphausiids. With reference to a previously published model in the Atlantic, we compare the practical differences in the Atlantic and Pacific Ocean. Using projected environmental change from the IPCC A1B climate scenario, we make predictions of future species abundance changes in the Pacific and Atlantic. Our model suggests that species abundance in both oceans between latitudes 30 degrees and 60 degrees (both N and S) will increase due to the temperature rise predicted over the next 200 years, whereas at low latitudes responses are likely to differ between the oceans, with little change predicted for the Atlantic, but species depletion predicted for the Pacific.

Understanding how climatic factors affect populations requires detailed investigation of the demographic parameters and population modelling. Here, we focus on the modelling of a southern fulmar population over a 39 year period in Terre Adelie, Antarctica, using Leslie matrix models to understand from a prospective and retrospective point of view, how vital rates and their variations, affect the cyclic population dynamics. The elasticity of population growth rate to adult survival was very high (0.95), as predicted by a slow-fast continuum in avian life histories. However, adult survival varied little between years (mean +/- SD: 0.92 +/- 0.07), and could not explain the strong fluctuations observed in the number of breeders and chicks. The high temporal fluctuations of the proportion of breeders (0.57 +/- 0.22) and breeding success (0.70 +/- 0.14) had the strongest impact on population dynamics, despite their weak elasticities (0.05). Before the 1980s, population fluctuations were mainly explained by a direct impact of sea-ice extent (SIE) anomalies during summer (by a threshold effect) on the proportion of breeders. After 1980s, 3 years periodic population fluctuations were best predicted by 3 years cyclic variations in the proportion of breeders. SIE showed a marked change of periodicity during the 1980s, and SIE during winter fluctuated with a 3 years periodicity during 1980-1995. The marked change in population dynamics, through a change of the variations of the proportion of breeders, may be explained in the light of a regime shift that probably occurred around the 1980s, and which affected the sea ice environment, the availability of prey, and thus the demographic parameters and population dynamics of southern fulmars.

Is the Fatty Acid Composition of Freshwater Zoobenthic Invertebrates Controlled by Phylogenetic or Trophic Factors?	LIPIDS												We studied the fatty acid (FA) content and composition of ten zoobenthic species of several taxonomic groups from different freshwater bodies. Special attention was paid to essential polyunsaturated fatty acids, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA, 20:5n-3), docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, 22:6n-3), and arachidonic acid (ARA, 20:4n-6); and the n-3/n-6 and DHA/ARA ratios, which are important for consumers of higher trophic levels, i.e., fish. The content and ratios of these FA varied significantly in the studied zoobenthic species, consequently, the invertebrates were of different nutritional quality for fish. Eulimnogammarus viridis (Crustacea) and Dendrocoelopsis sp. (Turbellaria) had the highest nutrition value for fish concerning the content of EPA and DHA and n-3/n-6 and DHA/ARA ratios. Using canonical correspondence analysis we compared the FA profiles of species of the studied taxa taking into account their feeding strategies and habitats. We gained evidence that feeding strategy is of importance to determine fatty acid profiles of zoobenthic species. However, the phylogenetic position of the zoobenthic species is also responsible and may result in a similar fatty acid composition even if species or populations inhabit different water bodies or have different feeding strategies.

Larvae were removed from euphausiids by means of a modified Baermann apparatus filled with a pepsin-HCl digest solution. Abundances of larvae in euphausiids ranged from 0 to 58.2 x 10(-5). Larvae (N = 100) were in the third stage (bearing one cuticle) or moulting from the second stage to the third stage (bearing two cuticles). Euphausiids, particularly T. raschii, which represented 98% of the total euphausiids sampled, are important intermediate hosts of A. simplex in the St. Lawrence estuary. These data indicate the importance of the St. Lawrence estuary as an enzootic zone for A. simplex and thus a valuable area to study the biology and the transmission of this parasite.

J	Werner, I				Werner, I			Faecal pellet production by Arctic under-ice amphipods - transfer of organic matter through the ice/water interface	HYDROBIOLOGIA					33rd European Marine Biology Symposium	SEP 07-11, 1998	WILHELMSHAVEN, GERMANY	Fed Minist Educ & Res, Merck, Oldenburg Landesbank, Nordwest Oelleit GmbH				The underside of Arctic sea ice is inhabited by several autochthonous amphipod species (Apherusa glacialis, Onisimus spp., Gammarus wilkitzkii). The amphipods graze on ice-bound organic matter, such as ice algae, detritus and ice fauna, and release faecal pellets into the underlying water column, thus forming a direct link between the sea ice and the pelagic ecosystems. Experiments on faecal pellet production rates showed species-specific differences, which were related to size of the animals. The smallest species, A. glacialis, produced the highest mean number of pellets (15.4 pellets ind.(-1) d(-1)), followed by Onisimus spp. (2.7 pellets ind.(-1) d(-1)) and the largest species, G. wilkitzkii (1.1 pellets ind.(-1) d(-1)). Relative carbon content of the pellets was very similar in all species (21.2-22.6% dry mass). Juvenile amphipods (Onisimus spp., G. wilkitzkii) produced more pellets with less POC than adults. Based on field determinations of the POC concentration in the lowermost 2 cm of the sea ice (mean: 36.4 mg C m(-2)) and mean amphipod abundances (A. glacialis: 33.8 ind. m(-2), Onisimus spp.: 0.5 ind. m(-2), G, wilkitzkii: 9.4 ind. m(-2)) in the Greenland Sea in summer 1994, the amount of POC transferred from the ice to the water by faecal pellet production was estimated (0.7 mg C m(-2) d(-1) or almost 2% of ice-bound carbon). Since this process probably takes place in all ice-covered Arctic regions as well as during all seasons, grazing and pellet production by under-ice amphipods contributes significantly to matter flux across the ice/water interface.																	0018-8158	1573-5117				MAY 15	2000	426	1-3					89	96		10.1023/A:1003984327103							WOS:000088580000009

Two common zooplankton species, the euphausiid Euphausia pacifica and the copepod Calanus pacificus, consumed diverse types of field-collected marine snow, including diatom flocs, abandoned larvacean houses, and dinoflagellate aggregates, regardless of their composition, C:N ratio, age, or the availability of alternate dispersed food. Ingestion rates of aggregates by E, pacifica increased with increasing marine snow concentration, although in situ concentrations of aggregates were not sufficient to elicit a maximum ingestion rate. Ingestion rates of aggregates by E. pacifica at higher aggregate concentrations were from 9 to 15 mu g C euphausiid(-1) h(-1). Assimilation efficiencies of euphausiids grazing on marine snow were 83 % (dinoflagellate snow) and 64 to 75 % (diatom/larvacean house snow). These results indicate that marine snow can be an important food source for marine zooplankton and that consumption of large aggregates is likely to play a role in the cycling of carbon and the structure of food webs in the pelagic zone of the ocean.

A comparison between Zooglider and shipboard net and acoustic mesozooplankton sensing systems	JOURNAL OF PLANKTON RESEARCH												Some planktonic patches have markedly higher concentrations of organisms compared to ambient conditions and are <5 m in thickness (i.e. thin layers). Conventional net sampling techniques are unable to resolve this vertical microstructure, while optical imaging systems can measure it for limited durations. Zooglider, an autonomous zooplankton-sensing glider, uses a low-power optical imaging system (Zoocam) to resolve mesozooplankton at a vertical scale of 5 cm while making concurrent physical and acoustic measurements (Zonar). In March 2017, Zooglider was compared with traditional nets (MOCNESS) and ship-based acoustics (Simrad EK80). Zoocam recorded significantly higher vertically integrated abundances of smaller copepods and appendicularians, and larger gelatinous predators and mineralized protists, but similar abundances of chaetognaths, euphausiids, and nauplii. Differences in concentrations and size-frequency distributions are attributable to net extrusion and preservation artifacts, suggesting advantages of in situ imaging of organisms by Zooglider. Zoocam detected much higher local concentrations of copepods and appendicularians (53 000 and 29 000 animals m(-3), respectively) than were resolvable by nets. The EK80 and Zonar at 200 kHz agreed in relative magnitude and distribution of acoustic backscatter. The profiling capability of Zooglider allows for deeper high-frequency acoustic sampling than conventional ship-based acoustics.

The results show that sulfhydryl group is essential for the activity of the enzyme. Inactivation kinetics of the enzyme by mercuric chloride (HgCl2) has been studied using the kinetic method of the substrate reaction during inactivation of enzyme previously described by Tsou. The kinetic results show that the inactivation of the enzyme is an irreversible reaction. The microscopic rate constants for the reaction of Hg2+ with free enzyme and with the enzyme-substrate complex are determined. Comparison of these rate constants indicates that the presence of substrate offers marked protection of this enzyme against inactivation by Hg2+. The above results suggest that the cysteine residue is essential for activity. (c) 2006 Published by Elsevier B.V.

Discriminant classification of fish and zooplankton backscattering at 38 and 120 kHz	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												Acoustic scattering layers were evaluated for species classification by means of 38- and 120-kHz mean volume backscattering strength ((S) over bar (v)) collected during a 1995 acoustic-trawl survey of Pacific hake Merluccius productus off the west coasts of the United States and Canada. Scattering layers selected for analyses were shallower than 150 m and were analyzed with a -79-decibel (dB) S-v integration threshold. Pacific hake, euphausiids, and Pacific hake-euphausiid mixes dominated the layers. Other scatterers (unidentified, noneuphausiid, or non-Pacific hake sources) were included in the analyses. The overall mean volume backscatter difference (Delta(S) over bar (v) = (S) over bar (v) (120 kHz) - (S) over bar (v) (38) (kHz)) was computed for each species category, and results varied depending on the species composition of the scattering layer (i.e., Pacific hake = -7.1 dB, euphausiids = 11.9 dB, Pacific hake-euphausiids = 3.5 dB, and other species = 0.1 dB). Discriminant function analysis of (S) over bar (v 120) (kHz) and (S) over bar (v) (38) (kHz) separated echoes originating from each of the dominant scattering layers. Backscatter was then classified into species groups with a quadratic discriminant classification model, which obtained an overall correct classification rate of 84%. The use of multiple frequencies and these analytical methods (e.g., frequency differencing and discriminant classification functions) can provide an efficient and objective means of classifying sound-scattering layers composed of different taxonomic groups.																	0002-8487	1548-8659				MAR	2006	135	2					488	499		10.1577/T04-140.1							WOS:000237818500023						
J	Vlietstra, LS				Vlietstra, LS			Spatial associations between seabirds and prey: effects of large-scale prey abundance on smallscale seabird distribution	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												The purpose of this study was to examine whether variation in the extent to which marine birds track prey over small spatial scales can be attributed, in part, to fluctuations in regional prey abundance. The distributions of 4 marine bird species were compared to the distribution of acoustically determined prey biomass on days with contrasting prey abundances measured over a 10 x 20 km (regional) spatial scale. Spatial associations were measured at smaller (local) spatial scales, ranging from 0.2 to 7.6 km. Spatial concordance (i.e. overlap) between the distribution of acoustic biomass and the rhinoceros auklet Cerorhinca monocerata and between acoustic biomass and the Pacific loon Gavia pacifica at the smallest spatial scale (0.2 km) was greater on days when regional prey abundance was relatively low than on days when regional prey abundance was relatively high. This pattern was not evident in Brandt's cormorant Phalacrocorax penicillatus or the common murre Uria aalge. The densities of all 4 marine bird species examined were, however, only significantly correlated with densities of acoustic biomass on days when regional prey abundance was relatively low. I propose that short-term fluctuations in regional prey abundance account for some of the widespread variation previously observed in the strength of spatial associations between marine birds and their prey.																	0171-8630	1616-1599					2005	291						275	287		10.3354/meps291275							WOS:000229699400024

With this purpose, three distinct measurements of lipofuscin levels (% area fraction, granule density and mean granule size) were recorded in ten sections of the olfactory lobe cell mass (OLCM) per animal. The image analysis was based on the autofluorescence Emitted by the pigment, which accentuates the contrast between the lipofuscin granules and the background tissue. The concentration of lipofuscin increased significantly with age and was independent of sex. The relationship between age and lipofuscin concentration (area fraction and granule density) was best described by a seasonalized von Bertalanffy function, since the accumulation rate of the pigment dramatically slowed down in fall-winter, probably as a result of reduced seasonal metabolism. The present results confirm the potential of the lipofuscin method in the estimation of physiological age in penaeids and suggest that the application of this methodology can be useful in studies of age structure in wild populations and in the assessment of natural resources.

Phospholipid characteristics and neutral lipid fatty acid composition related to temperature and nutritional conditions in ecologically important amphipod species from the northern Baltic Sea	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY												Lipid composition of the benthic, stenothermal amphipod Monoporeia affinis collected from constantly cold deep-water (>80 m) regions of the northern Baltic Sea was analysed in detail to study phospholipid characteristics, its relation to thermal adaptation as well as potential effects of food quality and seasonal variability. Similar measurements were performed on the littoral, eurythermic amphipod Gammarus spp. Fatty acid (FA) composition of storage lipids of Pontoporeia femorata, a sibling species of M. affinis, was also studied. Interannual and interspecies variability in selected FA was observed both in triacylglycerols (TAG) and phospholipids (PL). Differences in monounsaturated vs. polyunsaturated (MUFA/PUFA) FA combinations of phosphatidyl ethanolamine (PE) diacyl and alkylacyl subgroups were also observed. Seasonal variability in M. affinis was considerably lesser compared to Gammarus spp. A literature synopsis shows that in diacyl PE the share of the FA combination MUFA/PUFA increases with lowering body temperature (40-55% in cold-adapted organisms vs. 5-15% in warm adapted ones), signifying that this characteristic is probably in key position concerning regulation of membrane fluidity in temperature adaptation. According to this feature M. affinis belongs to the group of cold-adapted stenothermic species (Group 1) while eurythermic Gammarus spp. settles in the Group 2 (cold-acclimatized) or 3 (warm-acclimatized/tropical) depending on the status of temperature adaptation. Omnivory and/or periodical food item switching is an important strategy in benthic organisms in high-latitude areas characterised by recurring long poor-nutritional periods. Since many benthic species utilise a time-averaged, integrated food source from phytal and animal matter from various sources the FA composition of TAG of the amphipod species measured here do not exclusively point towards any specific feeding mode or food source. In general, using selected FA as food source markers to assess the diet of field collected more-or-less omnivoric species cannot be considered as an optimal approach. The current study gives more insight to the biochemistry of biological membranes of aquatic crustaceans that is essential in estimation of the capacity of the thermal adaptation/acclimatization of organisms as well as the potential effects of food quality on storage lipids.

Patchiness was measured by using a count-based statistic using euphausiid densities and applied to 11 yr of detailed size-specific enumerations from the California Cooperative Oceanic Fisheries Investigations program. We rejected the hypothesis of size-independent patchiness for seven of the eight species. The most common pattern observed was a "U-shaped'' curve, showing elevated patchiness in the smallest size classes, a rapid decrease in patchiness of intermediate-sized euphausiids, and a later increase in patchiness of adults following the onset of reproductive maturity. These size-dependent changes parallel ontogenetic changes in spatial dispersion observed for some marine fishes. The initial descending limb of the patchiness curve appears to be caused by turbulent diffusion, while the later ascending limb of the curve is consistent with the onset of predator-induced aggregation behavior. The patterns were surprisingly consistent across years and different reproductive characteristics (egg-brooding vs. broadcast spawning euphausiids).

Sequence-based identification of individual phylotypes revealed ingestion of diatoms, dinoflagellates and other groups of organisms consistent with their known feeding ecology. Simultaneously profiling the seawater (plankton) allowed direct comparison to the dietary profiles. In Mytilus edulis, 50% of the detected plankton community was observed in the dietary profiles. Conversely, 34% of the phylotypes detected in the dietary profiles were not observed in seawater samples. Similarity-based cluster analysis of the dietary profiles from 6 sympatric species (4 epifaunal, 2 infaunal) of bivalves revealed a distinct, species-specific clustering pattern in 5 species, indicating a partial division of food based resources. Interestingly, both infaunal species investigated had dietary profiles that clustered not only at the species-specific level, but also as a distinct infaunal group. Trophic overlap was also present as evidenced by multiple shared phylotypes across all species. Mimachlamys varia did not group in a species-specific manner, suggesting a more generalist feeding strategy. Together, these results demonstrate the utility of a PCR-DGGE approach to study the feeding ecology of marine bivalves. This method offers a fast and accurate way to investigate the trophic interactions of marine bivalves (and presumably other invertebrates) across both large spatial and temporal scales.																	0171-8630	1616-1599					2009	381						109	118		10.3354/meps07959							WOS:000266150000009

However, the prey M. mola consumes to fuel this prodigious growth remains poorly known. Sunfish were thought to be obligate gelatinous plankton feeders, but recent studies suggest a more generalist diet. In this study, through molecular barcoding and for the first time, the diet of sunfish in the north-east Atlantic Ocean was characterised. Overall, DNA from the diet content of 57 individuals was successfully amplified, identifying 41 different prey items. Sunfish fed mainly on crustaceans and teleosts, with cnidarians comprising only 16% of the consumed prey. Although no adult fishes were sampled, we found evidence for an ontogenetic shift in the diet, with smaller individuals feeding mainly on small crustaceans and teleost fish, whereas the diet of larger fish included more cnidarian species. Our results confirm that smaller sunfish feed predominantly on benthic and on coastal pelagic species, whereas larger fish depend on pelagic prey. Therefore, sunfish is a generalist predator with a greater diversity of links in coastal food webs than previously realised. Its removal as fisheries' bycatch may have wider reaching ecological consequences, potentially disrupting coastal trophic interactions.

These data, with those from earlier studies, indicated that there was probably a slowing of lipofuscin accumulation and metabolic rate in large/old individuals between 1 and 2.4 years. The ranges of carapace length and body weight in the 2.4-yr laboratory group fell entirely within those of the 1-yr group. It was impossible to accurately distinguish individual crayfish from these age groups using traditional size criteria. Conversely, there was no overlap in the brain lipofuscin contents of individuals from the two age classes, enabling 100% differentiation on this criterion. Although increasing variation in lipofuscin concentrations and slowing of the accumulation rate with increasing age would lead to widening confidence intervals of age predictions for older individuals, the present results again demonstrate that, at least in these laboratory reared crayfish, lipofuscin is a much better predictor of age than conventionally used size indices. Despite a wide range of ambient water temperatures (7-33-degrees-C, mean 19-degrees-C), the variance of lipofuscin concentrations in the 2.5-yr-old field-grown crayfish was not significantly different from that of similarly aged individuals reared under constant laboratory conditions, suggesting that individuals in the population were relatively cohesive in their response to varying temperatures and that confidence levels for age determinations of field animals might be of the same order as those obtained for laboratory subjects. The results of the present study are further incentive for continuing the evaluation of lipofuscin as an index of crustacean age.																	0022-0981						1992	161	1					79	89		10.1016/0022-0981(92)90191-C							WOS:A1992JV93700007						
J	Sheehy, MRJ				Sheehy, MRJ			Quantitative comparison of in situ lipofuscin concentration with soluble autofluorescence intensity in the crustacean brain	EXPERIMENTAL GERONTOLOGY												The intensity of soluble 'lipofuscin-like' autofluorescences extracted from the brain of the freshwater crayfish, Cherax quadricarinatus, was compared with the concentration of morphological lipofuscin present in sections of the same tissue. This study represents the first quantitative demonstration that these soluble autofluorescences, previously attributable to lipofuscin or fluorescent age pigment (FAP), actually bear no quantitative relationship to it at all. This result confirms previous suspicions in the literature. In some cases the intensities of these unidentified soluble autofluorescences are positive linear or curvilinear functions of or an or body weight and, therefore, may give the misleading impression that they are related to age and derived from age pigment. It is strongly recommended that researchers, particularly on aquatic species, avoid using the original biochemical assay procedure for lipofuscin and its more recent modifications.																	0531-5565					MAY-JUN	1996	31	3					421	432		10.1016/0531-5565(95)02034-9							WOS:A1996UN72800008	9415124

Use of this boundary condition, along with certain assumptions, allows reduction of what is a very complex scattering problem to a relatively simple, approximate ray-based solution. Because of the diversity of this problem, the formulation is presented in two articles: this first one in which the basic physics of the scattering process is described where the incident sound wave is nearly normally incident upon a single target (i.e., the region in which the scattering amplitude is typically at or near a maximum value for the individual) and the second one [Stanton et al., J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 94, 3463-3472 (1993)] where the formulation is heuristically extended to all angles of incidence and then statistically averaged over a range of angles and target sizes to produce a collective echo involving an aggregation of randomly oriented different sized scatterers. In this article, a simple ray model is employed in the deformed cylinder formulation [Stanton, J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 86, 691-705 (1989)] to describe the scattering by finite length deformed fluid bodies in the general shape of elongated organisms. The work involves single realizations of the length and angle of orientation. Straight and bent finite cylinders and prolate spheroids are treated in separate examples. There is reasonable qualitative comparison between the structure of the data collected by Chu et aL [ICES J. Mar. Sci. 49, 97-106 (1992)] involving two decapod shrimp and this single-target normal-incidence theory. This analysis forms the basis for successful comparison (presented in the companion article) between the extended formulation that is averaged over an ensemble of realizations of length and angle of orientation and scattering data involving aggregations of up to 100's of animals.

J	Veit, RR; Harrison, NM				Veit, Richard R.; Harrison, Nancy M.			Positive Interactions among Foraging Seabirds, Marine Mammals and Fishes and Implications for Their Conservation	FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION												There is increasing recognition of the importance of "positive interactions" among species in structuring communities. For seabirds, an important kind of positive interaction is the use of birds of the same species, birds of other species, and other marine predators such as cetaceans, seals and fishes as cues to the presence of prey. The process by which a single bird uses, say, a feeding flock of birds as a cue to the presence of prey is called "local enhancement" or "facilitation." There are subtly different uses of each of these terms, but the issue we address here is the ubiquity of positive interactions between seabirds and other marine predators when foraging at sea, and whether as a result of their associations the feeding success, and therefore presumably the fitness, of individual seabirds is increased. If this contention is true, then it implies that conservation of any one species of seabird must take into consideration the status and possible conservation of those species that the focal species uses as a cue while foraging. For example, conservation of great shearwaters (Ardenna gravis), which often feed over tuna (e.g., Thunnus) schools, should take in to consideration conservation of tuna. Ecosystem management depends on understanding the importance of such processes; the loss of biodiversity, and the consequent threat to foraging success, may be a substantial threat to the stability of marine ecosystems.																	2296-701X					OCT 6	2017	5								121	10.3389/fevo.2017.00121							WOS:000451594300002

Densities of foraging seabirds in 2018 (piscivorous divers: 4.7 birds km(-2), planktivorous divers: 5.1, shearwaters: 0.7, surface feeders: 6.6) were lower than those in 2017 (piscivorous divers: 14.7 birds km(-2), planktivomus divers: 10.3, shearwaters: 11.9, surface feeders:11.9). Acousticallydetermined prey biomass in 2018 (fish: 6.4 m(2) nmi (-2), zooplankton: 2.3) was also lower than in 2017 (fish: 18.4 m(2) nmi(-2), zooplankton: 5.5). Similarly, biomass of macrozooplankton (amphipods, euphausiids, Neocalanus spp. and Calanus marshallae) sampled using bongo nets was smaller in 2018. At scales of 5-30 km, correlations between the seabird density and prey biomass were weaker (-0.2-0.3 of Pearson's r) in 2018 than those in 2017 (0.4-0.9) for all seabirds except planktivomus divers. We suggest that the lack of sea ice, and the resulting lack of ice-edge phytoplankton blooms, may weaken trophic linkages by causing a low biomass of secondary consumers and hence a reduced density of seabirds.																	0967-0645	1879-0100				DEC	2020	181				SI				104898	10.1016/j.dsr2.2020.104898							WOS:000600873000008						
J	Stanton, TK; Chu, DZ; Wiebe, PH				Stanton, TK; Chu, DZ; Wiebe, PH			Sound scattering by several zooplankton groups. II. Scattering models	JOURNAL OF THE ACOUSTICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA												Mathematical scattering models are derived and compared with data from zooplankton from several gross anatomical groups-fluidlike, elastic shelled, and gas bearing. The models are based upon the acoustically inferred boundary conditions determined from laboratory backscattering data presented in part I of this series [Stanton er al., J. Acoust. Sec. Am. 103, 225-235 (1998)]. The models use a combination of ray theory, modal-series solution, and distorted wave Born approximation (DWBA). The formulations. which are inherently approximate, are designed to include only the dominant scattering mechanisms as determined from the experiments. The models for the: fluidlike animals (euphausiids in this case)ranged from the simplest case involving two rays, which could qualitatively describe the structure of target strength versus frequency for single pings, to the most complex case involving a rough inhomogeneous asymmetrically tapered bent cylinder using the DWBA-based formulation which could predict echo levels over all angles of incidence (including the difficult region of end-on incidence). The model for the elastic shelled body (gastropods in this case) involved development of an analytical model which takes into account irregularities and discontinuities of the shell. The model for gas-bearing animals (siphonophores) is a hybrid model which is composed of the summation of the exact solution to the gas sphere and the approximate DWBA-based formulation for arbitrarily shaped fluidlike bodies. Then is also a simplified ray-based model for the siphonophore. The models are applied to data involving single pings, ping-to-ping variability, and echoes averaged over many pings. There is reasonable qualitative agreement between the predictions and single ping data, and reasonable quantitative agreement between the predictions and variability and averages of echo data.

J	Boer, M; Graeve, M; Kattner, G				Boer, M; Graeve, M; Kattner, G			Impact of feeding and starvation on the lipid metabolism of the Arctic pteropod Clione limacina	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY												Feeding and starvation experiments were carried out with Clione limacina sampled in Kongsfjorden (Svalbard, Arctic) during summer 2002. Dry mass and lipid mass, lipid class and fatty acid compositions were analysed. Specimens of C limacina used for the feeding study had a mean length of 25 mm, a dry mass (DM) of 13.7 mg, and a moderate lipid content of 12.1 %DM. Animals were allowed to ingest only one individual of its exclusive prey, Limacina helicina which had 8.0 mm in diameter, 21.4 mg DM and 8.7% lipid of ash-free DM. Five days after feeding, the dry mass of C limacina had increased from 13.7 to 25.3 mg which corresponds to an uptake of about 80% of the ash-free DM (14.3 mg) of L. helicina. Lipid mass increased from 1.5 to 3.9 mg which is almost two times more the ingested lipid from L. helicina (1.2 mg lipid). Thus, the major portion of lipids was synthesised de novo by C. limacina from non-lipid compounds. These lipids were triacylglycerols (TAG) and 1-O-alkyldiacylglycerol ethers (DAGE), increasing from low proportions of 6.1% and 5.7% to 42.3% and 25.8%, respectively. Considerable de novo synthesis was observed for the monounsaturated fatty acids 16:1(n-7), 17:1(n-8), 18:1(n-9), and 18:1(n-7) and the alkyl moiety 16:0. The increase in the polyunsaturated fatty acids 22:6(n-3), 20:5(n-3), and 18:4(n-3) corresponded with the amount available by ingestion of L. helicina, supporting that C. limacina is not able to synthesise polyunsaturates. After 15 days of digestion, dry mass and lipids dropped almost back to the initial values. During the 100-day starvation experiment, two groups of animals were separately considered as storage lipid-rich and lipid-poor animals because of their large differences in the amount and proportion of TAG and DAGE. Storage lipid-rich C. limacina were only found until day 50, whereas lipid-poor animals were present throughout the experiment. In the lipid-rich specimens, the levels of TAG were about twice that of DAGE. The proportions of TAG decreased considerably during the 50 days of starvation (from 48.3% to 25.1% of total lipid). DAGE, varying between 16.5% and 20.5%, showed only a small decrease. The lipid-poor animals survived 100 days of starvation, exhibiting low initial amounts and proportions of storage lipids which were nearly exhausted at the end. In all C. limacina specimens, the total lipid content remained almost constant showing that lipid and non-lipid components were simultaneously utilised. This implies that body shrinkage may be an important adaptation to long-term starvation. Based on these results, it is possible to estimate the potential survival period of lipid-rich C. limacina under food limitation. A model, which considers maturity and reproduction (egg production), reveals that lipid-rich specimens might be able to survive up to 260 days without food. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Biological data on species composition and abundance during this period are scarce due to the logistical challenges posed when sampling these regions. Here, we characterize the plankton community composition during the polar night using water samplers and zooplankton net samples (50, 64, 200, 1500 mu m), supplemented by acoustics (ADCPs, 300 kHz), to address a previously unresolved question-which species of zooplankton perform diel vertical migration during the polar night? The protist community (smallest plankton fraction) was mainly represented by ciliates (Strombidiida). In the larger zooplankton fractions (50, 64, 200 mu m) the species composition was represented primarily by copepod nauplii and small copepods (e.g., Microcalanus spp., Pseudocalanus spp. and Oithona similis). In the largest zooplankton fraction (> 1500 mu m), the euphausiid, Thysanoessa inermis, was the most abundant species followed by the chaetognath Parasagitta elegans. Classical DVM was not observed throughout the darkest parts of the polar night (November-mid-January), although, subtle vertical migration patterns were detected in the acoustic data. With the occurrence of a more distinct day-night cycle (i.e., end of January), acoustical DVM signals were observed, paralleled by a classical DVM pattern in February in the largest fractions of zooplankton net samples. We suggest that Thysanoessa spp. are main responsible for the acoustical migration patterns throughout the polar night, although, chaetognaths and copepods may be co-responsible.

In the winter-spring population the males dominate (SR > 1), in summer and autumn the females prevail (SR < 1). A connection was found between the SR and the water temperature two years earlier (minimal in that year and average for May, during which period zygotes are maturing, and embryogenesis and larval development take place). As a result of the increasing temperature, the share of the males in the population is reduced. The seasonal dynamics of the SR of T. raschii are discussed in connection with a general view about life cycles in euphausiids. The evolutionary processes ensuring the formation of the proper sexual structure in euphausiid populations as a whole, are considered.																	0011-216X	1568-5403				SEP	2002	75		8				937	956		10.1163/15685400260569599							WOS:000180702800001

Predominant fatty acids were the polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA): eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), linoleic acid (LA), arachidonic acid (ARA), linolenic acid (LNA) together with the monounsaturated fatty acid 18:1 omega 9 and the saturated fatty acid 16:0. FA markers indicated that available food was constituted of incompletely degraded phytodetritus and terrestrial inputs, as well as animal remains. PUFA contents depended on the diet and the capacity of animals to desaturate and elongate LNA and LA in long chain PUFA as EPA and ARA respectively. Based on their FA compositions, we showed that gammarids represent naturally-occurring freshwater sources of essential PUFA, and could play a fundamental role in pelagic-benthic coupling and energy recycling in the ecosystem. The complexity of the feeding strategies of D. villosus - detritivorous, omnivorous, carnivorous - makes this species efficient at exploiting different components of the available food and may be a key factor in its high invasive success.

Nineteen enzyme loci were examined for 7 population samples of P. elegans, and the proportion of polymorphic loci (P0.95) and average frequency of heterozygotes per locus (H) were calculated as 0.11 and 0.026, respectively. Fifteen enzyme loci were examined for 2 populations of E. hamata, and P0.95 and H were calculated as 0. 10 and 0.038, respectively. On the basis of allele frequencies at 2 enzyme loci it is possible to suggest that P. elegans population samples collected in the Sea of Japan were reproductively isolated from those in the Oyashio. Moreover it would appear that 4 population samples of P. elegans in the Sea of Japan are representative of a panmictic population. Differences in allele frequencies between population samples of the Oyashio suggest that these populations are genetically structured. It appears that genetic structuring exists in the 2 population samples investigated for E. hamata also. P. elegans and E. hamata expressed no common alleles over all the loci assayed indicating that the 2 species are phylogenetically very distant within the phylum Chaetognatha.

Seasonal growth, molt, and egg production rates of Nyctiphanes simplex (Crustacea: Euphausiacea) juveniles and adults in the Gulf of California	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												Seasonal distribution of biomass and somatic growth, molt, and egg production rates of Nyctiphanes simplex were estimated in the Gulf of California (November 2005, January 2007 and July 2007) and associated with 12 environmental variables to define the conditions in which the higher biomass production rates occur. Daily growth rates, estimated from shipboard incubations, indicated that N. simplex did not grow or decreased in size in all the seasons, with higher proportions of animals in these 2 growth categories in July (21 and 52%, respectively) than in January (7 and 43%) and November (35 and 12%). Thus, the proportion of individuals that grew was higher in November (53%) and January (50%) than in July (27%). Mean juvenile and adult inter-molt period (IMP) based on direct measurements was 5 d in January (range: 3 to 7 d), 3.8 d in July (2 to 8 d) and 4.4 d (3 to 7 d) for September to October 2010 (used as proxy for November, since not enough IMP data were available for that month). Calculations based on the inverse molting rate method estimated higher mean IMP (6.7 d; range 4 to 60 d). N. simplex mean (+/-SD) juvenile and adult daily total biomass production rate was 0.16 +/- 0.13 mg DW m(-3) d(-1) (DW = dry weight) and mean annual integrated production was 71 +/- 58 mg DW m(-3) yr(-1). The greatest contribution to N. simplex biomass production was through somatic growth (46%), followed by molts (32%) and eggs (22%). N. simplex had high biomass and biomass production rates mostly in regions with <100 m seafloor depth, in the northeast Gulf during November, northwest during January, and along the central east coast of the Gulf during July, associated with upwelling conditions that geographically change with winter anticyclonic and summer cyclonic surface circulation. Thus, numerous predators that energetically depend on this prey must seasonally change their distribution pattern to detect the spatially variable centers of N. simplex biomass production in the Gulf of California.																	0171-8630	1616-1599					2012	455						173	194		10.3354/meps09631							WOS:000304607100012

However, effects of jellyfish outbreaks in the ecosystems remain poorly understood and little or no information is available on their dietary preferences - in relation to the seasonal shifts of prey abundance - and on the potential variability of their impact on marine food webs. The mauve stinger Pelagia noctiluca (Forsskal, 1775) is by far the most common outbreak-forming scyphozoan jellyfish in the Western Mediterranean. By use of a combination of stomach contents, stable isotope (SI) and fatty acid (FA) analyses, we tested the hypothesis that changes in the seasonal dietary sources of P. noctiluca parallel changes in the FA and SI composition. Stomach content and biomarker analyses suggested that P. noctiluca is not a selective predator, cyclically shifting between carnivory and omnivory depending on the seasonality of accessible prey. The combination of SI and FA analyses highlighted the importance of microzooplankton as prey. Specific FA biomarkers showed that the diet of P. noctiluca changed seasonally depending on the availability of living plankton or suspended detritus. This study also revealed significant biochemical differences between jellyfish somatic and gonadal tissues, with total fatty acid concentration in the gonads up to ten times higher than in the somatic tissues.

J	Miller, TW; Hankin, DG				Miller, TW; Hankin, DG			Descriptions and durations of premolt setal stages in female Dungeness crabs, Cancer magister	MARINE BIOLOGY												For crustaceans with a well-defined annual molting season, such as adult female Dungeness crabs (Cancer magister Dana), setal molt staging can, in principle, be used to predict molting destiny of individual crabs. Size-specific predictions of molting probability could, in turn, be useful for estimating mortalities due to molting. Female Dungeness crabs were collected January-March 1997 at depths of 10-30 m off the California coast, USA (41degreesN). Intermolt stage A(1)-C-4 and premolt stages D-0, D-1', D-1", D-1''' and greater than or equal toD(2) were described based on features of the branchial epipod. Laboratory experiments suggested that stage D-1' was the earliest stage beyond which eventual molting was inevitable so that molting destiny could be determined. Estimated mean number of days from the beginning of stage D-1' to molting was 85. Estimated individual stage durations, based on laboratory experiments, were 24, 51, -4, 18, and 20 days, respectively, for stages D-0, D-1', D-1", D-1''', and greater than or equal toD(2). The estimated -4 days for stage D-1"' suggests that this stage must be very brief and raises a question of its utility in designation of molt stages. Molt staging of three field samples, 300-600 crabs in each, collected prior to the 1997 annual molting season, indicated an increase in the size and frequency of crabs staged D-1' or later as the time to molt approached, although crabs of 150 mm carapace width and larger showed few signs of molt preparation. Because the duration of the molting season (approximately 120 days) for adult female C. magister in northern California exceeds the estimated maximum duration of reliable prediction of molting destiny (85 days), it does not appear that molt staging can be used to predict molting destiny in this population. However, the procedures that we have used in this paper for application to female C. magister might be used with success for other crustaceans if the duration of stages D-1' to molting exceeds the duration of the molting season, and furthermore may be used for describing temporal molting trends.																	0025-3162					JAN	2004	144	1					101	110		10.1007/s00227-003-1180-y							WOS:000187504900012						
J	Lehette, P; Hernandez-Leon, S				Lehette, Pascal; Hernandez-Leon, Santiago			Carbon dioxide production rates of marine epipelagic copepods in subtropical waters during the late winter bloom	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY												Carbon dioxide production rates of mixed epipelagic copepods were measured during the so-called late winter bloom in the vicinity of the Canary Islands. Respiration rates were measured using a simple and sensitive infra-red gas analyser coupled to a manifold containing an equilibrator module to transfer seawater CO2 to the gas phase. The system allowed the determination of the carbon dioxide content of one sample in 20 to 40 min. Respiration rates obtained were similar to previous oxygen consumption rates in subtropical waters. A relative wide range of carbon dioxide production rates was observed due to the metabolic condition of the organisms. Direct measurement of respiration rates after the capture showed high values (11-fold) compared to standard rates at starving conditions after only 4-6 h of incubation in filtered seawater. The results showed that short-term (0.5 h) CO2 production rates by copepods can be measured in relatively large incubation volumes (600 ml) minimizing crowding and bottle effects. A standardized method is proposed in order to obtain comparable results of metabolic rates in marine mesozooplankton. (C) 2010 Published by Elsevier B.V.

J	Shelton, AO; Mangel, M				Shelton, Andrew O.; Mangel, Marc			Estimating von Bertalanffy parameters with individual and environmental variations in growth	JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL DYNAMICS												Variation among individuals is an ubiquitous feature of natural populations. However, the relative roles of intrinsic individual differences and stochastic processes in generating variation remain poorly understood. For somatic growth, identifying the contribution of individual and stochastic processes to observed variation in size has important implications both for basic and applied biology. Here we propose and develop methods for estimating individual variation in growth using size-at-age data. We modify the von Bertalanffy growth model to explicitly incorporate individual, environmental, and stochastic variation and provide analytic expressions for the mean and variance of length-at-age in populations. We use a Bayesian statistical model to estimate individual variation from length-at-age data and apply the model to simulated data to test its efficacy. Although a first step towards understanding individual variation, we demonstrate that estimating individual variation from observational samples is possible and provide a platform for future analytical and statistical developments.																	1751-3758	1751-3766					2012	6			2	SI		3	30		10.1080/17513758.2012.697195							WOS:000309709600002	22882022

In this study, we investigated the resource utilization of Euphausia pacifica within the epipelagic zone (0-200 m depth) in the East Sea (Japan Sea) during spring bloom, using stable isotope analysis. The C-13 and N-15 values of pico- to micro-particulate organic matters (POMs) from the surface to 200-m depth layers were significantly different. The C-13 and N-15 values of E. pacifica adults showed significant differences between sexes. Stable isotope analysis showed that E. pacifica females fed mainly on the surface layer POM, whereas the males fed primarily in the deeper layers, since the contributions of POMs in the 100-m and 200-m depth layers to their diets were relatively high. We suggest that high primary productivity in the surface layer in spring and the sinking particles derived from it may provide sufficient energy for the reproduction of E. pacifica females and male development, respectively.

Individuals were collected off the south coast of Portugal in December 1997 and July 1998. Gut evacuation rates (R.h(-1)) were calculated from the slope of the regression of the natural logarithm of dry stomach content weight versus time, using data obtained by the "serial slaughter method". The values obtained during laboratory (R = 0.172 h(-1)) and field experiments (R = 0.177 h(-1)) are compared with gut evacuation rates reported for other marine organisms. The results obtained for both experiments are within the range of the values in the literature, even in the case in which different methodologies were used.

J	PERISSINOTTO, R				PERISSINOTTO, R			MESOZOOPLANKTON SIZE-SELECTIVITY AND GRAZING IMPACT ON THE PHYTOPLANKTON COMMUNITY OF THE PRINCE EDWARD ARCHIPELAGO (SOUTHERN-OCEAN)	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												Dense phytoplankton blooms are often found during austral summer and autumn in the Prince Edward Archipelago (47-degrees-S, 38-degrees-E). These blooms are dominated by the large diatoms Chaetoceros radicans and Rhizosolenia curvata and by the silicoflagellate Dictyocha speculum. Size-selectivity experiments, using the dominant herbivorous zooplankton found in the area, show that the nano-phytoplankton is preferentially selected by all taxa. Only 2 euphausiid species appear to have a significant (p < 0.05) positive selection for the smaller netplankton (20 to 37-mu-m). Poor utilization of these diatom blooms is also supported by the results of a comparative study of grazing impact during a bloom (April 1985) and a non-bloom condition (April/May 1989). When phytoplankton biomass is low, the zooplankton community ingests 33 to 48% of the euphotic zone chlorophyll a per day, or 76 to 81% of daily primary production. However, during bloom conditions the grazing impact is reduced to only 5 to 10% of chlorophyll a concentration and 9 to 17% of primary production per day. Preferential selection for the smaller cells may have an energetic significance as nanoplankton seems to represent a food source of higher nutritional value than bloom-generating diatoms. It is suggested that the bulk of the phytoplankton blooms sinks out of the photic zone and provides an important transfer of biomass from the pelagic to the benthic subsystems.																	0171-8630					JAN	1992	79	3					243	258									WOS:A1992HJ85100005

Lipid composition of the three co-existing Calanus species in the Arctic: impact of season, location and environment	POLAR BIOLOGY												Arctic species of Calanus are critical to energy transfer between higher and lower trophic levels and their relative abundance, and lipid content is influenced by the alternation of cold and warm years. All three species of Calanus were collected during different periods in Kongsfjorden (Svalbard, 79A degrees N) and adjacent shelf during the abnormally warm year of 2006. Lipid composition and fatty acid structure of individual lipid classes were examined in relation with population structure. Wax esters dominated the neutral lipid fraction. Phosphatidylcholine (PC) dominated the structural lipids followed by phosphatidylethanolamine (PE). PC/PE ratios of 3-6 suggested an increase in PC proportions compared to earlier studies. Depending on the time scale, fatty acids of wax esters illustrated either trophic differences between fjord and offshore conditions for C. hyperboreus and C. finmarchicus or trophic differences related to seasonality for C. glacialis. Similarly, seasonality and trophic conditions controlled the changes in fatty acids of triglycerides, but de novo synthesis of long-chain monoenes suggested energy optimization to cope with immediate metabolic needs. Polar lipids fatty acid composition was species specific and on the long-term (comparison with data from the past decade) composition appears related to changes in trophic environment. Fatty acid composition of PC and PE indicated relative dominance of 20:5n-3 in PC and 22:6n-3 in PE for all three species. The combination of PE and PC acyl chain and phospholipid head group restructuring indicates an inter-annual variability and suggests that membrane lipids are the most likely candidate to evaluate adaptive changes in Arctic copepods to hydrothermal regime.

J	HILL, KT; WOMERSLEY, C				HILL, KT; WOMERSLEY, C			CRITICAL ASPECTS OF FLUORESCENT AGE-PIGMENT METHODOLOGIES - MODIFICATION FOR ACCURATE ANALYSIS AND AGE ASSESSMENTS IN AQUATIC ORGANISMS	MARINE BIOLOGY												Fluorescent age-pigment (FAP) quantification has recently been proposed as a means of estimating age in aquatic vertebrates and invertebrates. However, various aspects related to currently adopted procedures remain untested and a distinct relationship between FAP accumulation and chronological age has yet to be established. The present study was undertaken to critically evaluate the effects of specimen and extract handling procedures (including temperature, time, ultrasonication, and solvent systems) on the expression of native FAP fluorescence using the post-mitotic tissues of laboratory-reared specimens of the teleost Oreochromis mossambicus as model systems. FAP-like fluorophores increased in vitro in brain, heart, and muscle tissues and their extracts with increased storage temperature (- 20-degrees-C and above) and time. Sonification of homogenates greatly enhanced this effect and generated other non-native fluorophores in sample solution. Fluorescence assay temperature also affected expression of results, and aqueous-phase extracts, used in previous studies, were found to contain large amounts of fluorescent flavin contaminants. Using modifications of the above procedures, age-related patterns of accumulation were subsequently examined in O. mossambicus brain and, for the first time, position correlations between chronological age and whole organ as well as weight-specific FAP concentration were validated. The significance of these findings are discussed in relation to previous FAP studies.																	0025-3162						1991	109	1					1	11		10.1007/BF01320225							WOS:A1991FM85100001

Feeding dynamics of the invasive gastropod Tarebia granifera in coastal and estuarine lakes of northern KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa	ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE												Gut fluorescence and carbon budget techniques were applied to Tarebia granifera (shell height 10-12 mm) at the iSimangaliso Wetland Park, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. This snail has recently invaded a number of estuaries in northern KwaZulu-Natal, where it reaches densities of over 1000 ind.m(-2) and becomes a dominant component of the benthic community. Its rapid establishment and spread have raised concerns about potential top-down impacts on the ecosystem. This study shows that T. granifera can utilize large amounts of microphytobenthos (MPB) in addition to detritus. In situ total available MPB pigment concentrations ranged from 11.6 to 110.5 mg pigm. m(-2). T. granifera's gut pigment content ranged from 54 to 1672 mu g pigm. ind(-1). Gut evacuation rates (k) ranged from 0.36 to 0.62 h(-1) (R-2 range: 16.2-35.2, P < 0.05). Individual ingestion rates ranged from 6.6 to 30.4 mu g pigm. ind.(-1) d(-1). T. granifera was estimated to consume from 0.5 to 35% of the total available MPB biomass per day, or 1.2-68% of the daily primary benthic production. The carbon component estimated from the gut fluorescence technique contributed 8.7-40.9% of the total gut organic carbon content. The average carbon daily ration contributed by microalgal biomass was approximate to 16% body carbon per day. Variability in the data was attributed to the complex feeding history of snails. Further studies are needed to validate these results and provide more information on the ecological impact of T. granifera on this wetland and other similar invaded ecosystems, both estuarine and freshwater.

Physiological constraints and the influence of diet on fatty acids in the yolk of gentoo penguins, Pygoscelis papua	JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE PHYSIOLOGY B-BIOCHEMICAL SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENTAL PHYSIOLOGY												Avian yolk fatty acids (FA) composition is influenced by two main factors: maternal diet and genetic factors that regulate FA metabolism. However, due to embryonic developmental requirements, yolk FA are thought to be physiologically constrained and less useful for dietary and trophic studies. We assessed the relative contributions of diet and physiological constraints in determining the yolk FA composition of a marine bird, the gentoo penguin (Pygoscelis papua) by comparing FA signatures of yolks and prey between a captive, controlled- feeding experiment and a wild population. Captive and wild yolk FA signatures differed even though both groups' yolk lipids were composed primarily of three FA (16:0, 18:0 and 18:1n-9). Differences were due to FA occurring in relatively low abundance, but which mirrored differences in the FA composition of diets. However, yolk FA signatures were correlated across three penguin species suggesting that common developmental constraints can be relatively more important than species-specific differences in diet or egg-laying physiology. While yolk FA are constrained, several minor components of yolk FA are reflective of diets and the calibration coefficients resulting from this study have the potential to be incorporated into predictive models and allow for quantitative dietary and trophic studies using FA analysis of penguin egg yolks.

Carbon flow through the pelagic food web in southern Chilean Patagonia: relevance of Euphausia vallentini as a key species	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												The southernmost Patagonian region constitutes a major glaciered area with a high freshwater input loaded with particulate and dissolved matter. We assessed the relevance of the terrestrial (allochthonous) and marine (autochthonous) matter that permeates into the fjord and channel system and their possible impact on the euphausiid-based food web. A research cruise (CIMAR 16) was conducted from 18 October to 13 November 2010 (austral spring) in the area between Magellan Strait and Drake Passage to study the physical-chemical and biological characteristics of the pelagic food web, as well as the main biological processes linked with the food web. The dominance of phytoplankton within the autochthonous fractions of particulate organic carbon (POC) and the high abundance and bacterivory rate shown by the heterotrophic nano-flagellates suggest an interplay between microbial and classical food webs. Euphausia vallentini showed a moderate grazing impact (3% of the gross primary production) and a daily ration of 18.6%, and the fecal pellet production rate corresponded to 24.5% of the ingestion rate. This species removed heterotrophic prey (67.5%) preferentially over diatoms (32.5%), and the ingested diet was mainly dinoflagellates, tintinnids, crustacean nauplii and centric diatoms. Overall, euphausiids fed preferentially on marine matter, which showed a tight link with the pelagic food web. Congeneric species of the genus Euphausia shared the condition of 'key species' as they constitute a major carbon and energy flow from lower to higher trophic levels and an important part of the POC flux through their active vertical migration and passive fecal-carbon export.

Ecological Insights from Pelagic Habitats Acquired Using Active Acoustic Techniques	ANNUAL REVIEW OF MARINE SCIENCE, VOL 8	Annual Review of Marine Science											Marine pelagic ecosystems present fascinating opportunities for ecological investigation but pose important methodological challenges for sampling. Active acoustic techniques involve producing sound and receiving signals from organisms and other water column sources, offering the benefit of high spatial and temporal resolution and, via integration into different platforms, the ability to make measurements spanning a range of spatial and temporal scales. As a consequence, a variety of questions concerning the ecology of pelagic systems lend themselves to active acoustics, ranging from organism-level investigations and physiological responses to the environment to ecosystem-level studies and climate. As technologies and data analysis methods have matured, the use of acoustics in ecological studies has grown rapidly. We explore the continued role of active acoustics in addressing questions concerning life in the ocean, highlight creative applications to key ecological themes ranging from physiology and behavior to biogeography and climate, and discuss emerging avenues where acoustics can help determine how pelagic ecosystems function.																	1941-1405		978-0-8243-4508-2				2016	8						463	490		10.1146/annurev-marine-122414-034001							WOS:000368369200020	26515810

Spatial and temporal variation in lipid and fatty acid profiles of western rock lobster pueruli at first settlement: biochemical indicators of diet and nutritional status	MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH												Rock lobster species are found worldwide and have a life history that includes development through a planktonic phyllosoma followed by a nektonic non-feeding puerulus that relies on stored energy during recruitment into near-shore habitats. Recruitment to adult populations of western rock lobster (Panulirus cygnus) is highly variable and is likely to be strongly influenced by shelf width and oceanic conditions affecting cross-shelf transport and nutrition. Since the nutritional status of newly settled pueruli will reflect the phyllosoma feeding environment and distance swum, we studied levels of lipid, fatty acid (FA) and protein of 422 pueruli and 79 first instar juveniles from four Western Australian locations. Lipid levels generally were inversely related to shelf width but were variable, suggesting pueruli may travel complex trajectories to coastal settlement. Lipid and FA composition of pueruli were consistent with spatial and seasonal variation in Leeuwin Current and coastal productivity regimes. Seasonal differences in FA composition occurred regardless of the year of settlement. Pueruli had lower lipid levels during ENSO years, when recruitment tends to be lower also. Measures of puerulus nutritional status appear to provide valuable insights into the processes underpinning recruitment in Panulirus cygnus and other commercially and ecologically important species.

Crabs were individually exposed to fluoxetine concentrations for 7 d. Effects on locomotion were assessed at the end of the exposure using an open field test adapted to C. maenas in the present study. Tissue samples were later collected to evaluate fluoxetine effects on physiological functions using the activity of key enzymes and other parameters as biomarkers, namely: N-acetyl-beta-glucosaminidase (NAGase) in the epidermis (moulting) and the hepatopancreas; cholinesterases (ChE) in muscle (neuromuscular cholinergic transmission); NADP(+)-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) and lactate dehydrogenease (LDH) in muscle (energy production); glutathione S-transferases (GST) in hepatopancreas (biotransformation and oxidative stress system); glutathione reductase (GR), and glutathione peroxidade (GPx), total glutathione levels (TG) and lipid peroxidation levels in the hepatopancreas (anti-oxidant defences and oxidative damage). Because no information on C. maenas NAGase activity was previously available, its variation during the moult cycle was also investigated. The results showed that locomotion was significantly increased at fluoxetine concentrations equal or above 120 mu g L-1, with animals spending more time moving, walking longer distances than controls. Levels of NAGase activity were found to vary in relation to C. maenas moult cycle, but no alterations were observed after exposure to fluoxetine. Significant increases in the activity of ChE, GST and GR enzymes, and the levels of TG were found, with a lowest observed effect concentration (LOEC) of 120 mu g L-1. Effects on locomotion were significantly and positively correlated to those induced on ChE activity. The results raise concern when hypothesising conditions of chronic exposure in the wild.

Marine plankton phenology and life history in a changing climate: current research and future directions	JOURNAL OF PLANKTON RESEARCH												Increasing availability and extent of biological ocean time series (from both in situ and satellite data) have helped reveal significant phenological variability of marine plankton. The extent to which the range of this variability is modified as a result of climate change is of obvious importance. Here we summarize recent research results on phenology of both phytoplankton and zooplankton. We suggest directions to better quantify and monitor future plankton phenology shifts, including (i) examining the main mode of expected future changes (ecological shifts in timing and spatial distribution to accommodate fixed environmental niches vs. evolutionary adaptation of timing controls to maintain fixed biogeography and seasonality), (ii) broader understanding of phenology at the species and community level (e.g. for zooplankton beyond Calanus and for phytoplankton beyond chlorophyll), (iii) improving and diversifying statistical metrics for indexing timing and trophic synchrony and (iv) improved consideration of spatio-temporal scales and the Lagrangian nature of plankton assemblages to separate time from space changes.

Compared to many other marine organisms, the level of PL was markedly high. The major fatty acids in the TAG of E. pacifica were saturated fatty acids (SFA, 14:0 and 16:0), monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA, 16:1 and 18: 1), and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA, 18:4 n - 3 and 20:5 n - 3, icosapentaenoic acid: EPA). The only fatty acids found in the tissue PL were SFA (16:0), MUFA (18: 1), and PUFA (20:4 n - 6, arachidonic acid: A-A, EPA, and 22:6 n - 3, docosahexaenoic acids: DHA). The comparatively high levels of 14:0,16:0,16:1 n - 7,16:2 n - 4,16:4 n - 1, 18:1 n - 7, 18:1 n - 9, 18:4 n - 3, and EPA in the TAG may be affected by the lipid composition of its phytoplankton prey, such as diatoms, which generally contain high amounts of these fatty acids. The levels of short chain 14:0, 16:1 n - 7, 16:2 n - 4, 16:4 n - 1, 18:1 n - 9, and 18:4 n - 3 decreased in PL, while A-A, EPA, and DHA increased. In particular, the levels of n - 3 PUFA in PL were markedly high in all specimens. The mean proportion of EPA plus DHA accounted for more than 45% (55.0% in PE and 47.7% in PC) of the total fatty acids. These results suggest that E. pacifica, which contains markedly high levels of EPA and DHA, may biosynthesize these PUFA by carbon chain elongation and desaturation or selectively accumulate n - 3 PUFA. In addition, their lipids may be an important source of n - 3 PUFA for higher marine animals, such as the pelagic marine fishes (sardines, anchovies, and other small fishes), which mainly prey on these euphausiids. Marine fish accumulate high levels of these n - 3 PUFA because they are unable to synthesize DHA. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

The objective of this study was to investigate the occurrence of eukaryotes and prokaryotes in the natural diet of adults and C5 copepodites of C. sinicus. Hypervariable regions of the eukaryotic 18S and prokaryotic 16S rRNA genes were amplified from the gut contents of C. sinicus collected from coastal seas around Taiwan and Hong Kong and sequenced by Illumina sequencing. Results showed that the diets of adults and C5 copepodites of C. sinicus were similar. However, the diet of C. sinicus seems to be different between the two sampling locations. Diatoms were detected in C. sinicus samples collected from both areas, whereas dinoflagellates were only detected in samples from Hong Kong. Hydrozoans were found to be common in C. sinicus samples from Taiwan, whereas ctenophores were common in samples from Hong Kong. The cyanobacterium Synechococcus was recovered in samples from both areas. Our results have provided DNA-based evidence to support previous suggestions that C. sinicus could feed omnivorously on a diverse assemblage of phytoplankton, animals and bacteria. The ability of C. sinicus to feed on the small larvae of their predators such as ctenophores may have important implications on future analyses of the marine planktonic food web.

J	Tanasichuk, RW				Tanasichuk, RW			Interannual variations in the population biology and productivity of Euphausia pacifica in Barkley Sound, Canada, with special reference to the 1992 and 1993 warm ocean years	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												I monitored the size composition, abundance, growth, reproductive biomass and productivity characteristics of Euphausia pacifica in Barkley Sound, Canada, from March 1991 through March 1997. Sea temperatures were anomalously warm in 1992 (El Nino Southern Oscillation, ENSO) and in 1993; the strongest upwelling over the study period occurred in 1992. Mean annual E. pacifica larval abundance was 6 times greater in 1992 than in 1991, the pre-ENSO year. Adult abundance in 1992 and 1993 was twice that for 1991 due to the strong recruitment moving through the population. Larval abundance fluctuated substantially since the warming while adult abundance returned to pre-ENSO levels in 1994. Growth conditions, as indicated by variations in the condition factor, did not vary significantly over the 6 yr study period. Length-at-maturity increased over the spawning season but interannual variations were too small to influence adult abundance. The sex ratio fluctuated randomly around a grand mean of 0.56 males within and between years. I present a procedure for defining spawning events as a function of larval development time and its variability. I found a number of discrete spawnings annually and suggest that there has been no change in spawning frequency or duration over the study period. I found no significant change in the size of any larval stage over the study period. The relationship between parental and larval abundance follows a Ricker stock-recruit relationship; larval abundance decreased at high parental abundances. Mean annual larval biomass and productivity (growth + moult) ranged from being the same as to 9 times greater than 1991 levels. Mean,adult biomass was 1.2 and 2 times greater in 1992 and 1993 respectively than in 1991; productivity was 1.8 and 2.3 times higher in 1992 and 1993 respectively and has returned to pre-ENSO levels. P:B ratios for total production ranged from 55 to 89 and from 8.6 to 12.4 for larvae and adults respectively. Population P:B ratios fluctuated between 10.7 and 23.3.																	0171-8630	1616-1599					1998	173						163	180		10.3354/meps173163							WOS:000077093600014

Measuring the distribution, abundance, and biovolume of zooplankton in an oligotrophic freshwater lake with a 710 kHz scientific echosounder	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY-METHODS												Acoustic surveys of the distribution and abundance of freshwater zooplankton were conducted in Lake Giles, an oligotrophic freshwater lake. Volume backscatter data from a 710 kHz scientific echosounder were converted to high-resolution spatial and temporal numerical density estimates of small zooplankton. Vertical net tows of a 153 m mesh closing bongo net at multiple depth intervals provided both identification of the types and sizes (0.5-1.5 mm length) of crustacean zooplankton present in the lake as well as an independent measurement of zooplankton numerical density. Net and acoustic estimates of zooplankton abundance, biovolume, and distribution were very similar. The improved resolution of the high-frequency acoustic sampling provides insight into several aspects of freshwater zooplankton ecology including: separation of migrating and non-migrating zooplankton, high resolution measurements of in situ zooplankton biovolume, calculation of in situ vertical velocities of migrating zooplankton, and fine-scale (sub-meter) horizontal and vertical zooplankton distribution during daytime, nighttime, and vertical migration events. These methods allow for more detailed and accurate estimates of zooplankton distribution than traditional net sampling methods can provide, including determining the total abundance of organisms within a specific habitat. They also provide higher resolution data in both space and time of smaller zooplankton taxa than have been measured previously in freshwater ecosystems.

J	Satterthwaite, WH; Mangel, M				Satterthwaite, William H.; Mangel, Marc			Behavioral models as a common framework to predict impacts of environmental change on seabirds and fur seals	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY												In this paper, we lay out the theoretical framework for using modeling approaches from behavioral ecology (in particular, state-dependent and game theoretical models) to predict the behavioral responses of central place foragers to changes in their food environment. We develop individual-based models of the state-dependent behavior of individual central place foragers over the course of a breeding season and show how our approach provides a framework for the prediction of trip lengths, foraging location, food delivery, and reproductive success. We formulate a common framework of models for northern fur seals (Callorhinus ursinus), black-legged kittiwakes (Rissa tridactyla), and thick-billed murres (Uria lomvia), and provide worked examples parameterized to represent fur seals and murres. We then develop a game theoretic model at the colony-level for predicting the distribution of multiple individuals across space in the face of potential interference or facilitation, providing a worked example for kittiwakes. We demonstrate how these models can be used to predict near-term aspects of foraging behavior such as diet choice and trip destinations and durations at the individual and colony level. We show how (i) behavioral predictions can be translated into predictions of foraging success, (ii) foraging success can be scaled up to demographically relevant parameters such as survival and reproduction, and (iii) this approach can help predict impacts of environmental change on top-level predators.

Sedimentary sterols as biogeochemical indicators in the Southern Ocean	ORGANIC GEOCHEMISTRY					16th Annual V M Goldschmidt Conference	AUG-SEP -, 2006	Melbourne, AUSTRALIA					Abundances and isotopic compositions of sterols and of total organic carbon in surface sediments were measured at 18 stations in the Ross Sea, Antarctica. Ten sterols, 5 alpha-cholestan-3 beta-ol (cholestanol), cholest-5-en-3 beta-ol (cholesterol), cholest-5,22E-dien-3 beta-ol, 24-methyl-5 alpha-cholest-22E-en-3 beta-ol (brassicastanol), 24-methyl-cholest-5,22E-dien-3 beta-ol (brassicasterol), 24-ethyl-5 alpha-cholestan-3 beta-ol (sitostanol), 24-ethyl-cholest-5-en-3 beta-ol (sitosterol), 24-ethyl-cholest-5,22E-dien-3 beta-ol (stigmasterol), 4 alpha,23,24-trimethyl-5 alpha-cholestan-3 beta-ol (dinostanol), and 4 alpha,23,24-trimethyl-5 alpha-cholest-22E-en-3 beta-ol (dinosterol), are most widely distributed. Polytopic vector analysis of the variations in abundance resolved four sources for these compounds: an assemblage of phytoplankton characteristic of the Ross Sea Polynya, diatoms and associated consumers, zooplankton, and processes associated with heterotrophic dinoflagellates. Concentrations of stanols were strongly correlated with those of dinosterol and dinostanol. Concentrations of total organic carbon (TOC) ranged from 0.1% to 1.2% and were lowest on crests and banks and higher in basins. The mole fraction of organic carbon occurring as sterols ranged from 3 to 1100 ppm. Values were lowest at stations with anomalously old TOC (estimated from regional variations in the radiocarbon age of acid-insoluble organic carbon), thus pointing to weathering and redistribution of surface sediments as important factors in the differential degradation of sterols and TOC. The difference in first order rate constants for the degradation of these materials is ca. 0.002 yr(-1). Stigmasterol and the C-27 sterols were significantly enriched in C-13 relative to other sterols. The abundance of C-13 in TOC at four western stations was 4 parts per thousand higher than else-where. Abundances of C-13 in all sterols at these stations is also 4 parts per thousand higher than elsewhere, indicating enrichment of C-13 in the entire biological Community. Independent observations of P-CO2 in surface waters, together with known relationships between isotopic fractionation and the concentration of dissolved CO2, show that the isotopic zonation in organic carbon is due entirely to dynamic drawdown of CO2 in western surface waters. At those locations, late melting of ice produces salinity gradients that inhibit mixing of CO2 from deeper waters. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

As some anthropogenic emissions cannot be zero, to compensate them it will be necessary to remove GHGs from the atmosphere. Among possible methods, the Iron Salt Aerosol (ISA) offers new possibilities, including removal of methane and several other GHGs, as well as carbon dioxide. Several studies suggest that anthropogenic emissions of iron participate in the current primary productivity. As plans to decarbonize the world economy might also have inadvertent warming effects due to the reduction of iron emissions from fossil fuels burning, iron additions might help address this issue. ISA is different from the method known as Ocean Iron Fertilization and the differences are explained. ISA mimic natural processes and the dust which probably participated in the cooling during the ice-ages over the past million years. Still larger laboratory trials, safety and environmental impact studies and global chemical computer modeling are necessary before ISA would be ready to be trialed. Desk and laboratory studies indicate low cost, easy deployment and efficacy, all of which can be validated by future small scale field trials, a step needed before, if successful, a possible implementation at a climate-relevant scale.

To determine the changes of molecular mechanisms, which would lead to physiological changes in P. nana, we investigated mRNA expression involved in lipogenesis, the area of lipid droplets, the ratio of fatty acids, and life parameters (growth and fecundity) in response to temperature changes (15, 20, and 30 A degrees C) with comparative control at 25 A degrees C. Setting the temperature 25 A degrees C as a standard point, there were increases in mRNA expression, the area of the lipid droplets, and fatty acid composition at temperatures below the standard (15 A degrees C), while all the markers mentioned above significantly decreased at higher temperatures than the standard (25 A degrees C). Through fecundity and growth rate experiments, daily nauplii production was reduced and growth retardation was observed at both 15 and 20 A degrees C, but no noticeable differences in the two parameters were observed at 30 A degrees C compared to the control (25 A degrees C). This study provides a better understanding of the effects of temperature on lipogenesis in copepods.

Interannual variations in vital rates of copepods and euphausiids during the RISE study 2004-2006	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS												The River Influences on Shelf Ecosystems (RISE) program investigated the role of the Columbia River plume in enhancing productivity in the upwelling zone off Washington during four cruises from 2004 to 2006. Measurements of growth rates and brood sizes of euphausiids and egg production rates of copepods were used as indices of secondary production to determine whether these rates differed (1) among cruises as a function of differences in upwelling strength and (2) with latitude, both within the RISE study area and between the coastal waters of Washington and Oregon. Euphausia pacifica growth rates were significantly higher during June 2006 than during July 2004 and June 2005 but not significantly different between the RISE study area and Newport Hydrographic (NH) Line, Oregon. Euphausiid brood sizes were significantly higher during August 2005 than during any other cruise for both E. pacifica and Thysanoessa spinifera; our experiments did not indicate that brood sizes were higher in the northern part of the RISE study region. E. pacifica broods were larger for NH than RISE, but T. spinifera broods were not. Significant differences in egg production rates (EPRs) were found among cruises for both Calanus pacificus and C. marshallae, with higher EPRs during August 2005. EPRs on other cruises were less than half the maximum rates known for these species. EPRs of C. marshallae were similar between RISE and NH; C. pacificus EPRs were significantly higher (lower) in the RISE region in 2005 (2006). Interannual differences in ocean conditions affected zooplankton production more strongly than differences in latitude.																	2169-9275	2169-9291				JUL 14	2009	114								C00B08	10.1029/2008JC004826							WOS:000269920100002

Among the most useful traits for successful establishment in a new ecosystem are the size of the invader and its diet and feeding habits. During the last twenty years, Dikerogammarus villosus has been one of the most successful invaders of large European rivers and lakes. However, regarding feeding habits, results were confusing and sometimes contradictory. In this study, we attempt to define the feeding strategy of D. villosus using their FA content according to sex and the seasonal and the spatial variation in its feeding habit. Our results indicated that D. villosus is rather unspecialized with plasticity in its feeding behaviour, switching between different functional feeding groups depending on seasons, habitats and available resources. The selection of high quality resources may hence provide a strong advantage during the invasion process by optimizing the growth and the reproduction of the invader.

J	Sovik, SL; Rustad, T				Sovik, SL; Rustad, T			Effect of season and fishing ground on the activity of cathepsin B and collagenase in by-products from cod species	LWT-FOOD SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												Cathepsin B and collagenase are important enzymes in the quality-deteriorating processes of fish products. Fish by-products are the left-overs after preparation of the main product and are highly perishable fractions of the fish. They do, however, contain high-quality protein with a potential for utilization. This study characterizes the activity of cathepsins B and collagenase in by-products from five species of cod caught in different fishing grounds and in different seasons. Mean maximum cathepsin B activity was measured at 35 degrees C in the viscera and the liver, and 50 degrees C in cut off, while collagenase showed mean maximum activity at 20 degrees C in cut off, 35 degrees C in liver and 50 degrees C in viscera. Species, season and fishing ground significantly affected activity of cathepsin B and collagenase in cut off samples, while viscera samples were not significantly affected. Cathepsin B was more heat stable than collagenase in all three fractions. Both cathepsin B and collagenase from cut off were less heat stable than the corresponding enzymes from the other two fractions. (c) 2004 Swiss Society of Food Science and Technology.

J	Casanova, B				Casanova, B			The order Euphausiacea Dana, 1852	CRUSTACEANA												This paper presents the current state of our knowledge on the Euphausiacea, and is to be published eventually in Grasse's "Traite de Zoologie". The main characteristics of the order are listed and the external morphology is examined. The axial organization of the cephalothorax has led to an original study of the exoskeleton, the internal invaginations of which are mainly produced by the sternites. The development of the appendages has been followed from the hatching of the nauplius until the adult, as a part of the study on larval development. The anatomy of the various organs is essentially based on studies by authors from the first half of the 20th century. Nevertheless, it has been detailed, in particular for the gut and the genital apparatus, through S.E.M. observations. In the same way, the results of recent physiological studies are mentioned, as goes also for timely taxonomic, ecological, and palaeontological data. The Euphausiacea constitute a quite homogeneous group, and they are restricted to the pelagic realm, which can be deduced from some morphological adaptations, such as the naked filamentous gills or the thin thoracopods. Besides, it should be stressed that, among the Malacostraca, this order of the Eucarida holds a very interesting key position.																	0011-216X					OCT	2003	76		9				1083	1121		10.1163/156854003322753439							WOS:000189260900005

Many factors contribute to hinder progress in estimating and verifying age, growth, and life history strategies of billfishes. It is necessary to discern growth of an individual fish to circumvent problems in substantiating age, growth, longevity and age at maturity. These biological characteristics allow us to discover what life history periods are critical to survival and reproduction. 2. Two theoretical approaches may be considered for studying the age of billfish: Age may be delineated in terms of the passage of time (chronological age), or may be examined as the progression of physiological development (physiological age). 3. Hard tissues such as otoliths, spines, vertebrae and post-mitotic tissues contain a plethora of biological and ecological information documenting a fish's chronological and physiological age and individual life history. In calcified tissues, this information can be obtained when the proper techniques are used to investigate the structural and chemical components of billfish hard parts. Chemical analyses of stable isotopes and elemental concentrations in calcified tissues suggest that calcified tissues contain hydrographic, nutritional and migrational information-life history information. 4. Utilization of structural and chemical analyses of billfish otoliths, vertebrae, and other hard parts, enables specific phases of growth to be linked to environmental occurrences. Measurement of the metabolically accumulated cellular pigment, lipofuscin, in post-mitotic tissue may make it possible to define physiological age or readiness.

At 3-4 day intervals, sediment traps were deployed at three depths from the undersurface of the ice and water column samples were collected. Sampled variables included chlorophyll a (chl a) and pheopigments, particulate organic carbon and nitrogen (POC, PON), cell identification and enumeration, biogenic silica and dissolved inorganic nutrients. POC/PON, POC/chl a and Si/chl a ratios for suspended biomass as well as cell counts showed the presence of a diversified phytoplankton assemblage with a high microheterotrophic biomass. A major peak in algal sedimentation occurred at the end of the sampling season (chl a flux ca. 5 mg m(-2) d(-1)); the sedimented algae included both ice algae and phytoplankton species. Ice algae did not remain suspended in the plankton biomass, but sedimented rapidly upon release from the ice matrix. Results show that Saroma-ko had a rather special food web structure at the end of winter, when both high microalgal export and water column recycling simultaneously occurred under the ice cover.																	0924-7963					FEB	1997	11	1-2					133	148		10.1016/S0924-7963(96)00034-6							WOS:A1997WQ17100013						
J	SHEEHY, MRJ; ROBERTS, BE				SHEEHY, MRJ; ROBERTS, BE			AN ALTERNATIVE EXPLANATION FOR ANOMALIES IN SOLUBLE LIPOFUSCIN FLUORESCENCE DATA FROM INSECTS, CRUSTACEANS, AND OTHER AQUATIC SPECIES	EXPERIMENTAL GERONTOLOGY												Published attempts to extract lipofuscin from crustaceans and fish to assess age for fisheries research purposes have used essentially the same extraction methodology applied to insects, but have neither shown a conclusive age-dependence of spectrally similar fluorescence nor proved its association with lipofuscin. The reported lipofuscin solvent extraction method for fleshflies, Sarcophaga bullata, was manipulated by varying wash volume. This revealed that almost all age-dependent blue fluorescent material persisting in lipid fractions was actually pteridine-like. This finding was consistent with some previous independent results for Musca domestica. Examination of reported lipofuscin extraction protocols for other insects suggested that this problem was probably widespread. The pteridines are known to occur in unusually high amounts in insects, accumulating with age specifically in some members of this group by storage excretion, probably as a terrestrial water conservation strategy. In addition, there is growing evidence in the gerontological literature for other groups that solvent extracted blue fluorescence is not a true measure of lipofuscin content in tissues. These findings provide considerable insight into anomalies in putative lipofuscin fluorescence data between the insects and various aquatic species and suggest that there may be little basis for expectations of age-dependent fluorescence from aquatic species when the same gross extraction and crude purification methods are used.																	0531-5565	1873-6815					1991	26	5					495	509		10.1016/0531-5565(91)90038-N							WOS:A1991GL10200012	1756781

Spatio-temporal distribution of euphausiids: an important component to understanding ecosystem processes in the Gulf of Alaska and eastern Bering Sea	ICES JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE												Euphausiids (principally Thysanoessa spp.) are found in high abundance in both the eastern Bering Sea (EBS) and the Gulf of Alaska (GOA). They are an important part of these cold-water coastal and pelagic ecosystems as a key prey item for many species, including marine mammals, seabirds, and fish, forming an ecological link between primary production and higher trophic levels. Acoustic-trawl (AT) survey methods provide a means of monitoring euphausiid abundance and distribution over a large spatial scale. Four years of AT and bottom-trawl survey data (2003, 2005, 2011, and 2013) were available from consistently sampled areas around Kodiak Island, including Shelikof Strait, Barnabas Trough, and Chiniak Trough. We identified euphausiid backscatter using relative frequency response and targeted trawling, and created an annual index of abundance for euphausiids. This index has broad application, including use in the stock assessments for GOA wall eye pollock (Gadus chalcogrammus) and other species, as an ecosystem indicator, and to inform ecological research. We then used generalized additive models (GAMs) to examine the relationship between relative euphausiid abundance and potential predictors, including pollock abundance, temperature, bottom depth, and primary production. Model results were compared with an updated GAM of euphausiid abundance from the EBS to determine if the factors driving abundance and distribution were consistent between both systems. Temperature was not a strong predictor of euphausiid abundance in the GOA as in the EBS; warmer temperatures and lack of seasonal ice cover in the GOA may be a key difference between these ecosystems. Pollock abundance was significant in both the GOA and the EBS models, but was not a strongly negative predictor of euphausiid abundance in either system, a result not consistent with top-down control of euphausiid abundance.

J	Zhou, M; Zhu, YW; Tande, KS				Zhou, M; Zhu, YW; Tande, KS			Circulation and behavior of euphausiids in two Norwegian sub-Arctic fjords	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												We conducted 2 cruises in 2 subarctic fjords, Ullsfjorden and Sorfjorden, northern Norway, to investigate the role of coupled advection and individual behavior of euphausiids in determining their distribution and retention. The surveys examined the seasonal change in buoyancy-driven circulation in fjords due to surface cooling and ice formation during the fall and winter, and surface heating, freshwater runoff and a deep-water intrusion during the spring, as well as seasonal variations in euphausiid distribution and migration. The causes leading to vertical migration of euphausiids were studied by light and food measurements. Euphausiid transport was examined on the basis of timing and duration of euphausiid migration, as well as variations in water currents. Our results demonstrate the entrapment of euphausiids in these fjords. To understand the aggregation mechanisms, euphausiid swimming behavior was studied in terms of cruising speed, escape velocity, deterministic swimming and random walking. Existing stochastic aggregation theories were used to interpret the observations of swimming behavior. The mismatch between theories and observations found in this study led us to construct a new model configuration between aggregation, deterministic vs. random swimming, and dispersion.																	0171-8630	1616-1599					2005	300						159	178		10.3354/meps300159							WOS:000232714900015

In this study we aimed to establish the main factors determining the at-sea distribution of the little auk Alle alle, a very abundant seabird in the Arctic during the chick-rearing period. Multi-year data from vessel-based bird counts along the west coast of Spitsbergen were compared with hydro-acoustic prey estimates (top 30 m water layer), bathymetry, and sea surface temperature (SST) at 2 spatial scales: fine-(3 km) and meso-scale (12 km). Acoustic data for the top 10 m water layer was omitted due to excess noise. However, the amount of prey in the upper layer was assumed to be reflected by the prey in the deeper (20 to 30 m) layer because of the unsynchronized diel vertical migration performed by zooplankton under midnight sun conditions. We found that the foraging distribution of little auks was mainly restricted to the continental shelf, presumably due to high availability of Arctic zooplankton there. Also, little auks preferred habitat characterized by low SST and flat sea-bottom. Such areas are likely to contain the preferred prey species of little auks, given that Arctic zooplankton distribution is linked to cold ocean temperatures. The number of little auks at sea increased with increasing abundance of macrozooplankton, but was not correlated with their preferred mesozooplankton prey. We conclude that physical features play an important role for the foraging habitat selection of little auks. Aggregations of macrozooplankton may be easier for the birds to detect than smaller-sized mesozooplankton and may be more important for adult little auks than previously thought.

Intercomparison of zooplankton (net) sampling systems: Results from the ICES/GLOBEC sea-going workshop	PROGRESS IN OCEANOGRAPHY												An inter-comparison and evaluation of methods for sampling and determination of zooplankton distribution and biomass was conducted in a fjord environment (Storfjorden at More, Norway) from 2 to 13 June 1993. The inter-comparison was carried out with the German R/V "A. v. Humboldt" and the Norwegian R/V "Johan Hjort" and involved a total number of 38 scientific personnel from 8 countries. The inter-comparisons included the MOCNESS, BIONESS, MultiNet, LHPR, OPC, CPR, Gulf-V, CalCOFI 1-m Ring Net, and WP-2 net. In addition, acoustics data were collected with a Simrad EK500 echosounder operating on 4 frequencies (18, 38, 120, 200 kHz) and hydrographic, nutrient, phytoplankton, and meteorological data were collected to characterize the environment in which the comparisons were made; environmental changes were minor during the study. The results of this study corroborate the results of earlier studies. Mesh size of the net had a major influence on the biomass and species composition of the zooplankton community. There is a consistent relationship between retention (or escapement through the mesh) and the width of the organisms; about 50% of the organisms escape through the mesh at a width equal to the mesh size. The effect of towing speed on the extrusion of smaller organisms through the net can be substantial and adds to the loss due to escapement. Active avoidance of the sampler is only important for the larger macrozooplankton and not a significant problem for the mesozooplankton. Different vertical, oblique, and multiple opening/closing net systems produced similar estimates of zooplankton when operated with comparable mesh-sized nets and a sufficiently high mesh open area to mouth opening ratio. The choice of mesh size is important and 150 pm mesh is possibly an optimal mesh size for use in coastal waters with neritic zooplankton communities. Replicate tow variability was also consistent with earlier studies and reflects the need to understand the interplay between the underlying patchiness of the zooplankton distributions and the method of sampling. No single net is suitable to sample across the wide size range of zooplankton from small mesozooplankton to macrozooplankton. Recent large interdisciplinary programs to assess marine ecosystem structure and dynamics have recognized this through the use of nets designed to sample particular size fractions in combination with video and acoustic remote sensing techniques.

The population of the myctophid Benthosema glaciale displayed diverse diel vertical migration (DVM) behaviors, including normal DVM to surface waters at night, reverse DVM in the lower part of the water column in which fish ascended to similar to 200 m at day, as well as nonmigration of some individuals. The relative prevalence of these behavioral modes varied with season. Acoustic target tracking of individuals in deep water showed that B. glaciale was conspicuously inactive and drifted back and forth with weak tidal currents, essentially acting as plankton. Swimming was largely restricted to infrequent short bouts. More active swimming occasionally occurred in the vertical direction, and then in a stepwise pattern. Potential predators in deep water were swimming at speeds of <0.5 body length s-, with maximum speeds of similar to 1 body length s(-1). These results show that submerged echo sounders provide a means of non-intrusively studying both individual and population behavior of deep-living organisms.

Trophic niche partitioning of littoral fish species from the rocky intertidal of Helgoland, Germany	HELGOLAND MARINE RESEARCH												During a 3-year field study, interspecific and interannual differences in the trophic ecology of littoral fish species were investigated in the rocky intertidal of Helgoland island (North Sea). We investigated trophic niche partitioning of common coexisting littoral fish species based on a multi-tracer approach using stable isotope and fatty acids in order to show differences and similarities in resource use and feeding modes. The results of the dual-tracer approach showed clear trophic niche partitioning of the five target fish species, the goldsinny wrasse Ctenolabrus rupestris, the sand goby Pomatoschistus minutus, the painted goby Pomatoschistus pictus, the short-spined sea scorpion Myoxocephalus scorpius and the long-spined sea scorpion Taurulus bubalis. Both stable isotopes and fatty acids showed distinct differences in the trophic ecology of the studied fish species. However, the combined use of the two techniques added an additional resolution on the interannual scale. The sand goby P. minutus showed the largest trophic plasticity with a pronounced variability between years. The present data analysis provides valuable information on trophic niche partitioning of fish species in the littoral zones of Helgoland and on complex benthic food webs in general.

Trophic effects of fishing southern rock lobster Jasus edwardsii shown by combined fatty acid and stable isotope analyses	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												The southern rock lobster Jasus edwardsii is a commercial species that has benefited from the complete protection offered by no-take reserves, with higher abundances and larger animals recorded in reserves than in adjacent fished areas. What remains unclear is whether there is any change in the diet of lobsters in reserves, for example, as a result of increased intraspecific competition for food. We used combined chemical tracers to examine the diet of lobsters in fished and reserve areas in 2 bioregions in eastern Tasmania. delta N-15 values of lobsters were richer in fished than in reserve areas, indicating that lobsters eat a greater proportion of food items from higher trophic levels in fished areas. Mixing models suggest that ascidians, sea urchins and the turbinid gastropod were all important food sources for lobsters, but the importance of these food items differed between bioregions. This spatial variability may suggest that the small size of the reserve in one bioregion is inadequate at ensuring the diet of lobsters is protected from fishing pressure, Fatty acid profiles of lobsters supported the importance of these food sources to lobsters. Differences between bioregions, or inside and outside of reserves, were not apparent using fatty acids. The present study highlights that lobster fishing has the capacity to alter the trophic status of prey for generalist predators and suggests that fatty acid analyses may be limited in detecting changes in the dietary composition of such generalist feeders.

In aquatic species, the moulting fluid is released into the aqueous environment, and chitobiase activity present therein can be used to follow the dynamics of arthropod populations. Here, chitobiase activity was used for monitoring the impact of mosquito candidate larvicides on Daphnia pulex and Daphnia magna under laboratory conditions. Both species were exposed to spinosad (2, 4, 8 mu g L-1) and diflubenzuron (0.2, 0.4, 0.8 mu g L-1) for 14 days. Bacillus thuringiensis var. israelensis (Bti: 0.25, 0.5, 1 mu L L-1) was used as the reference larvicide. Chitobiase activity, adult survival, individual growth and fecundity, expressed as the number of neonates produced, were measured every 2 days. Average Exposure Concentrations of spinosad were ten-fold lower than the nominal concentrations, whereas only a slight deviation was observed for diflubenzuron. In contrast to Bti, spinosad and diflubenzuron significantly affected both species in terms of adult survival, and production of neonates. As compared to D. pulex, D. magna was more severely affected by diflubenzuron, at low and medium concentrations, with reduced adult growth and much lower chitobiase activity. Chitobiase activity was positively correlated with the individual body length, number of neonates produced between two consecutive observation dates, and number of females and neonates. In addition, the significant positive correlations between chitobiase activity measured on the last sampling date before the first emission of neonates and the cumulative number of neonates produced during the whole observation period strongly support the potential of the activity of this chitinolytic enzyme as a proxy for assessing the dynamics of arthropod populations exposed to larvicides used for mosquito control.

The storage of energy in the form of lipids is expected to follow a seasonal pattern; however, year-round observations are lacking. The seasonal variations of lipid classes and fatty acid compositions of four pelagic amphipods have been investigated. Individuals were collected at various depths during summer and winter expeditions to the Fram Strait and Svalbard archipelago (78 degrees-81 degrees N). Our results show a year-round dominance of wax esters and triacylglycerols over phospholipids for Themisto abyssorum, Themisto libellula, Themisto compressa and Cyclocaris guilelmi. High levels of the Calanus-marker fatty acids 20:1 and 22:1 (both isomers) during summer and winter indicated that all four species are part of the Calanus-based food web. Specific fatty acid trophic markers for diatoms and flagellates indicated that the lipid-based energy transfer could be traced back to the respective algal sources. We found a distinct difference between animals collected from very deep and shallow waters, which indicates that the lipid reservoir of these amphipods and their biochemical modifications seem to buffer seasonal variations in available prey and to allow an active, predatory life-style year-round in Arctic waters.

We studied the distribution of cetaceans, seabirds, pelagic fish, euphausiids and zooplankton over a 9 x 15 km bank to determine the conditions and processes that concentrated prey there and to examine the relative importance of bottom-up or top-down controls. Euphausiids were the primary prey during most foraging activity. While these were widespread in subsurface waters, foraging was concentrated on dense surface swarms that formed during daylight hours over 2 small crests. Internal wave passage resulted in upward movement and concentration of euphausiids in these areas through a coupling of physical processes and euphausiid behavior, resulting in surface swarms. Thus, internal waves appear to provide a critical mechanism enhancing trophic energy transfer. The formation of dense, localized and accessible prey concentrations was more important to foraging than was the overall available prey biomass. The estimated maximum daily consumption of euphausiids by cetaceans, seabirds and herring combined was < 0.4 % of the estimated instantaneous euphausiid biomass, and top-down control was unlikely to have substantially influenced euphausiid biomass at this site. Some predator species that do not prey extensively on euphausiids or herring were more prevalent in off-bank waters. The scales of predictability and the temporal dynamics of such features determine the manner in which populations of upper trophic level organisms utilize a variable environment.

Volume backscattering was measured in the Gulf of Maine at 43, 120, 200, and 420 kHz. Zooplankton composition and size were determined using net and video sampling techniques, and water properties were determined using conductivity, temperature, and depth sensors. Dominant scatterers have been identified using recently developed scattering models for zooplankton and microstructure. Microstructure generally did not contribute to the scattering. At certain locations, gas-bearing zooplankton, that account for a small fraction of the total abundance and biomass, dominated the scattering at all frequencies. At these locations, acoustically inferred size agreed well with size determined from the net samples. Significant differences between the acoustic, net, and video estimates of abundance for these zooplankton are most likely due to limitations of the net and video techniques. No other type of biological scatterer ever dominated the scattering at all frequencies. Copepods, fluid-like zooplankton that account for most of the abundance and biomass, dominated at select locations only at the highest frequencies. At these locations, acoustically inferred abundance agreed well with net and video estimates.

Seasonal variations in the growth rates of euphausiids (Thysanoessa inermis, T-spinifera, and Euphausia pacifica) from the northern Gulf of Alaska	MARINE BIOLOGY												The euphausiids Thysanoessa inermis (Kroyer 1846), Thysanoessa spinifera (Holmes 1900), and Euphausia pacifica (Hansen 1911) are key pelagic grazers and also important prey for many commercial fish species in the Gulf of Alaska (GOA). To understand the role of the euphausiids in material flows in this ecosystem their growth rates were examined using the instantaneous growth rate (IGR) technique on the northern GOA shelf from March through October in 2001-2004. The highest mean molting increments (over 5% of uropod length increase per molt) were observed during the phytoplankton bloom on the inner shelf in late spring for coastal T. inermis, and on the outer shelf in summer for T. spinifera and more oceanic E. pacifica, suggesting tight coupling with food availability. The molting rates were higher in summer and lower in spring, for all species and were strongly influenced by temperature. Mean inter-molt periods calculated from the molting rates, ranged from 11 days at 5 degrees C to 6 days at 8 degrees C, and were in agreement with those measured directly during long-term laboratory incubations. Growth rate estimates depended on euphausiid size, and were close to 0 in early spring, reaching maximum values in May (0.123 mm day(-1) or 0.023 day(-1) for T. inermis) and July (0.091 mm day(-1) or 0.031 day(-1) for T. spinifera).

They are formed from thermal interaction of aldehydes, hydrogen sulfide, and ammonia resulting from degradation components of lipids, amino acids, and thiamin. Many of them have interesting organo-leptic properties and relatively low flavor threshold values, and deserve particular attention. This review describes all alkyl-substituted and bicyclic 1,3,5-dithiazines identified in the flavor of foodstuffs as well as in model systems. Furthermore, this review provides a general description of the sensory properties of 1,3,5-dithiazines and additionally reports on new results and recent research developments in order to update information in the area of this hitherto almost overlooked chemical class of flavor compounds.																	8755-9129	1525-6103					1992	8	3					391	442		10.1080/87559129209540947							WOS:A1992KB10700003

Autonomous marine environmental monitoring: Application in decommissioned oil fields	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Hundreds of Oil & Gas Industry structures in the marine environment are approaching decommissioning. Inmost areas decommissioning operations will need to be supported by environmental assessment and monitoring, potentially over the life of any structures left in place. This requirement will have a considerable cost for industry and the public. Here we review approaches for the assessment of the primary operating environments associated with decommissioning - namely structures, pipelines, cuttings piles, the general seabed environment and the water column - and show that already available marine autonomous systems (MAS) offer a wide range of solutions for this major monitoring challenge. Data of direct relevance to decommissioning can be collected using acoustic, visual, and oceanographic sensors deployed on MAS. We suggest that there is considerable potential for both cost savings and a substantial improvement in the temporal and spatial resolution of environmental monitoring. We summarise the trade-offs between MAS and current conventional approaches to marine environmental monitoring. MAS have the potential to successfully carry out much of the monitoring associated with decommissioning and to offer viable alternatives where a direct match for the conventional approach is not possible.

The level of overlap in the utilization of this resource between seals and the purse-seine fishery was investigated using two overlap indices. For high overlap measures, seals and the purse-seine fishery utilized age-2 horse mackerel. For low overlap measures, seals mainly consumed age-0 fish whereas the fishery caught age-2 fish. Both indices were adjusted by the proportion of horse mackerel in the seal diet, with the assumption that the proportion consumed by the seals reflects the abundance of horse mackerel in the coastal waters of Cape Cross, Namibia. Both unadjusted and adjusted overlap indices showed that overlap between seals and the fishery in their utilization of juvenile horse mackerel was high only at times when horse mackerel abundance was high, and low when abundance was small. Confidence intervals and significance testing were included. Overall, there was little overlap between seals and the purse-seine fishery. This study provides important information that should be taken into account in the management of the horse mackerel resource.

Our main goal was to characterize micronektonic organisms using bi-frequency acoustic data (38 and 120 kHz) by calibrating an algorithm tool that discriminates groups of scatterers in the top 300 m of the productive oceanic zone east of Kerguelen Islands (Indian sector of the Southern Ocean). The bi-frequency algorithm was calibrated from acoustic properties of mono-specific biological samples collected with trawls, thus allowing to discriminate three acoustic groups of micronekton: (i) "gas-bearing" (Delta Sv.120-38 < -1 dB), (ii) "fluid-like" (Delta S-v,S-120-38 > 2 dB), and (iii) "undetermined" scatterers (-1 < Delta S-v,S-120-38 < 2 dB). The three groups likely correspond biologically to gas-filled swimbladder fish (myctophids), crustaceans (euphausiids and hyperiid amphipods), and other marine organisms potentially present in these waters and containing either lipid-filled or no inclusion (e.g. other myctophids), respectively. The Nautical Area Scattering Coefficient (NASC) was used (echo-integration cells of 10 m long and 1 m deep) between 30 and 300 m depth as a proxy of relative biomass of acoustic targets. The distribution of NASC values showed a complex pattern according to: (i) the three acoustically defined groups, (ii) the type of structures (patch vs. layers) and (iii) the timing of the day (day/night cycle). NASC values were higher at night than during the day. A large proportion of scatterers occurred in layers while patches, that mainly encompass gas-bearing organisms, are especially observed during daytime. This method provided an essential descriptive baseline of the spatial distribution of micronekton and a relevant approach to (i) link micronektonic group to physical parameters to define their habitats, (ii) investigate trophic interactions by combining active acoustic and top predator satellite tracking, and (iii) study the functioning of the pelagic ecosystems at various spatio-temporal scales.

Element patterns in albatrosses and petrels: Influence of trophic position, foraging range, and prey type	ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION												We investigated the concentrations of 22 essential and non-essential elements among a community of Procellariiformes (and their prey) to identify the extent to which trophic position and foraging range governed element accumulation. Stable isotope analysis (SIA) was used to characterise trophic (delta(15)N) and spatial patterns (delta(13)C) among species. Few consistent patterns were observed in element distributions among species and diet appeared to be highly influential in some instances. Arsenic levels in seabird red blood cells correlated with delta(15)N and delta(13)C, demonstrating the importance of trophic position and foraging range for arsenic distribution. Arsenic concentrations in prey varied significantly across taxa, and in the strength of association with delta(15)N values (trophic level). In most instances, element patterns in Procellariiformes showed the clearest separation among species, indicating that a combination of prey selection and other complex species-specific characteristics (e.g. moult patterns) were generally more important determining factors than trophic level per se.

The results showed clear diel feeding patterns for both E. vallentini adults and juveniles. High feeding activity occurred during dark hours in E. longirostris, while N. megalops did not show distinct diel feeding pattern. E. longirostris had the highest gut pigment levels, averaging 15.2 and 57.1 mug pigm ind(-1) in 1998 and 1999, respectively. A similar pattern was observed for E vallentini: 3.2 versus 6.5 ng pigm ind(-1) in juveniles and 4.4 versus 21.9 mug pigm ind(-1) in adults. Low average gut pigment levels were found for N. megalops during both years (range 2.0-4.5 mug pigm ind(-1)). Gut evacuation rates varied between 0.45 and 0.99 h(-1) for E vallentini adults, 0.47 and 1.36 h(-1) for E. vallentini juveniles, 0.41 and 1.08 h(-1) for N. megalops. A single measurement of 0.94 h(-1) was made for E longirostris. Ingestion rates for E. vallentini ranged from 0.24 to 1. 82 mug pigm ind(-1) d(-1) for adults and from 0.98 to 1.92 mug pigm ind(-1) d(-1) for juveniles. The highest individual ingestion rates were found for E longirostris (between 1.24 and 3.65 mug pigm ind(-1)d(-1)), and the lowest for N. megalops (0.23 mug pigm ind(-1)d(-1)). These ingestion rates were combined with data from the gut fullness technique to estimate the contribution of herbivory to the total daily carbon uptake. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

J	Fauchald, P				Fauchald, Per			Spatial interaction between seabirds and prey: review and synthesis	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												The Ideal Free Distribution theory predicts a close spatial match between predators and prey. Studies have shown that seabird and prey distribution seldom conforms with this prediction. In this study, I review recent theoretical advances in spatial predator-prey interactions and relate these with studies of seabirds and pelagic schooling fish and crustaceans. Studies on seabirds and prey have generally assumed that prey are nonresponsive. Predator-prey interactions should, however, be viewed as a 2-way spatial game where seabirds track concentrations of prey while prey move away from areas with high risk of predation. The outcome of the game depends on how seabirds and prey are spatially constrained. Constraints include the spatial distribution of resources, interspecific competition, the location of spawning and breeding areas, and limitations on diving depth. Although game theoretic models can explain some general aspects of the spatial interaction, the spatial distribution of seabirds and prey is generally much more aggregated and elusive than can be expected from the game theoretic equilibrium. This is because spatial pattern is formed through self-organizing behavior that includes schooling, local enhancement and area-restricted search (ARS). Schooling and local enhancement are processes with strong positive density dependence that destabilize the predator-prey interaction locally. However, the unstable local dynamics might be stabilized by spatial constraints and the effects of ARS processes at large scales.

Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is the most common form of diabetes and results from the body's ineffective use of insulin. Over ten dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-IV) inhibitory drugs have been developed and marketed around the world in the past decade. However, owing to the reported adverse effects of the synthetic DPP-IV inhibitors, attempts have been made to find DPP-IV inhibitors from natural sources. Food-derived components, such as protein hydrolysates (peptides), have been suggested as potential DPP-IV inhibitors which can help manage blood glucose levels. This review focuses on the methods of discovery of food-derived DPP-IV inhibitory peptides, including fractionation and purification approaches, in silico analysis methods, in vivo studies, and the bioavailability of these food-derived peptides. Moreover, food-derived DPP-IV inhibitory peptides discovered during this decade are listed and distributed in a 3D scatter plot graph based on their IC50, molecular weight, and grand average of hydropathicity values, which can help us to understand the relationship between the features of the peptides and their activities.

J	Donnelly, J; Sutton, TT; Torres, JJ				Donnelly, J; Sutton, TT; Torres, JJ			Distribution and abundance of micronekton and macrozooplankton in the NW Weddell Sea: relation to a spring ice-edge bloom	POLAR BIOLOGY												Micronekton and macrozooplankton were collected during the austral spring of 1993 in the NW Weddell Sea. Sampling was done in three areas of the marginal ice zone: pack ice, ice edge, and open water, to examine the short-term effects of the spring phytoplankton bloom on the distribution and abundance of dominant fish and invertebrate species. Significant differences were observed for several common species, including Salpa thompsoni,Euphausia superba, Electrona antarctica, Gymnoscopelus braueri,and G. opisthopterus. Increased abundance seaward of the pack ice for these species is attributed to elevated phytoplankton and zooplankton biomass at the ice edge and in the open water areas. Distribution of the hyperiid amphipods, Cyllopus lucasii and Vibilia stebbingi mirrored that of S. thompsoni. No distributional trends between the areas were observed for Thysanoessa macrura, the amphipods Cyphocaris richardi and Primno macropa, the decapod shrimp Pasiphaea scotiae, the scyphomedusae Atolla wyvilli and Periphylla periphylla, and chaetognaths, indicating a trophic independence from the ice-edge bloom for these species. Lower occurrence of the mesopelagic fish Bathylagus antarcticus and Cyclothone microdon under the ice suggested that trophic repercussions of the spring bloom can also extend to deeper living species.

J	Kibirige, I; Perissinotto, R				Kibirige, I; Perissinotto, R			In situ feeding rates and grazing impact of zooplankton in a South African temporarily open estuary	MARINE BIOLOGY												Recent studies in temporarily open estuaries of South Africa have shown that phytoplankton biomass is at times low, when compared to the high standing stock of the grazers. In situ grazing rates of the dominant zooplankton species were estimated at the Mpenjati Estuary once during the winter closed phase, in August 1999, and once during the summer open phase, in February 2000. The study aimed at determining what proportion of the energetic demands of the dominant grazers of the estuary is met by the available phytoplankton. Results show that the gut of all species exhibited higher pigment concentrations during the night than during the day, both in winter and summer. Gut pigment contents ranged from 0.27 to 5.38 ng pigm individual(-1) in the mysid Gastrosaccus brevifissura, from 0.16 to 1.63 ng pigm individual(-1) in the copepod Pseudodiaptomus hessei, from 0.12 to 0.45 ng pigm individual(-1) in the copepod Acartia natalensis, and from 0.8 to 5.44 ng pigm individual(-1) in the caridean Palaemon sp. [where pigm is the sum of chlorophyll-a (chl-a) and phaeopigments]. During the winter closed phase, gut evacuation rates for G. brevifissura P. hessei, and A. natalensis were 0.62, 0.42, and 0.46 h(-1), respectively. In summer, gut evacuation rates were 0.68, 0.48, and 0.46 h(-1) for G. brevifissura, P. hessei, and Palaemon sp., respectively. The rate of gut pigment destruction for G. brevifissura was 99.6% of the total ingested, one of the highest values ever recorded for any crustacean. A gut pigment destruction of 79.0% was measured for Palaemon sp., 95.7% for P. hessei, and 93.8% for A. natalensis. During winter the total grazing impact of the dominant zooplankton species ranged from 5.05 to 22.7 mg chl-a m(-2) day(-1) and accounted for 34-69% of the available chl-a in the water column. During summer, the grazing impact ranged between 0.45 and 0.65 mg chl-a m(-2) day(-1), accounting for 17-41 % of the available chl-a in the water column. This shows that the dominant zooplankton species of the Mpenjati have a very high grazing impact on algal cells. At times this may exceed 100% of the available phytoplankton production, suggesting that the zooplankton community may often resort to other food sources to meet all its energetic demands.																	0025-3162	1432-1793				FEB	2003	142	2					357	367		10.1007/s00227-002-0963-x							WOS:000181534800018

Analysing the diets of invertebrate predators using terminal restriction fragments	JOURNAL OF PEST SCIENCE												Analysing food webs in agricultural habitats is essential for the development of natural control strategies. Several molecular tools to investigate trophic interactions on a species-specific level have been developed in recent years and their advantages and limitations have been discussed. With this study we introduce another tool, terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (tRFLP). Generalist predators found in Australian brassica crops, their prey and abundant parasitoids were chosen as a model system to adapt and evaluate the tRFLP approach. Using general primers and selecting six restriction enzymes, we obtained species-specific tRF patterns for 21 of the most abundant arthropods in brassica crops. We detected up to three prey species in the gut contents of laboratory-fed predators. Detection rates differed among predators, ranging between 28 and 100%. The identification of a species-specific tRF pattern was strongly affected by the presence and concentrations of DNA from other species. In a preliminary field study, prey could be identified from 20% of the collected brown lacewings. The advantage of the tRFLP method is the possibility of identifying multiple species at once. This advantage is counterbalanced by methodological limitations, among which the most critical one is the fact that it will be difficult to maintain specificity in highly diverse ecosystems. However, if species diversity is limited and the target sequence and the primers are chosen to increase detection success, the tRFLP method can be used to study trophic interactions in the field.

Feeding aquaculture in an era of finite resources	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA												Aquaculture's pressure on forage fisheries remains hotly contested. This article reviews trends in fishmeal and fish oil use in industrial aquafeeds, showing reduced inclusion rates but greater total use associated with increased aquaculture production and demand for fish high in long-chain omega-3 oils. The ratio of wild fisheries inputs to farmed fish output has fallen to 0.63 for the aquaculture sector as a whole but remains as high as 5.0 for Atlantic salmon. Various plant-and animal-based alternatives are now used or available for industrial aquafeeds, depending on relative prices and consumer acceptance, and the outlook for single-cell organisms to replace fish oil is promising. With appropriate economic and regulatory incentives, the transition toward alternative feedstuffs could accelerate, paving the way for a consensus that aquaculture is aiding the ocean, not depleting it.

J	Olsen, SA; Ervik, A; Grahl-Nielsen, O				Olsen, Siri Aaserud; Ervik, Arne; Grahl-Nielsen, Otto			Deep-water shrimp (Pandalus borealis, Kroyer 1838) as indicator organism for fish-farm waste	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY												A feeding experiment was carried out with deep-water shrimp (Pandalus borealis), a common benthic inhabitant of Norwegian fjords. Shrimp were reared in tanks for three months, fed either salmon feed or cod, and the fatty acid profile of their muscle tissue was monitored. The salmon feed pellets and cod had completely different fatty acid compositions, with significant differences in most of the analysed fatty acids, eight of them, 14:0, iso 16:0, 16:1n7. 16:2n11, 18:3n3, 20:0, 22:0 and 22:1n11, differing between the two diets by a factor of 10 or more. The levels of the fatty acids in the diets differed also substantially from the levels in the shrimp tissue at the start of the experiment. The shrimp were fed ad libitum and both groups increased significantly in total fatty acid content in the course of the experiment. Nevertheless, the fatty acids made up no more than 6.5 mg g(-1) muscle tissue, with 88 +/- 1% of them bound in polar, membrane lipids. Their composition in the tissue did also change to a certain extent, but the resulting tissue composition did not reflect the fatty acid composition of the diets. Only two fatty acids, 18:2n6 and 18:3n3, clearly followed the dietary level. They are abundant in commercial salmon feed since they are rich in plant oils used as additives to the commercial feed. Determination of fatty acid levels in shrimp tissue may enable shrimp to be used as indicator organisms for the influence of organic fish-farm waste on the food web in adjacent areas.

The fatty acid profile of N. australis was markedly unsaturated, with a mean total omega 3 fatty acid content of 48.6+/-2.4% of total fatty acids. N. australis contained high levels of the essential long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids eicosapentaenoic (EPA, 20:5 omega 3) and docosahexaenoic (DHA, 22:6 omega 3), ranging from 16.6 to 36.5% and 11.1 to 24.8%, respectively. The concentration of total carotenoids ranged from 137 to 302 mu g g(-1) dry wt, with no significant differences in concentrations found with season or life stage. The carotenoids were comprised of 79.5% astaxanthin and 20.5% canthaxanthin. The lipid and pigment compositions of N. australis suggest that the species could serve as a suitable feed source for cultured salmonids. Like other euphausiids, N. australis contained high levels of fluoride, with a seasonal range between 277 and 3507 mu g g(-1) dry wt. The high fluoride levels found in N. australis would not detract from its potential as a feed source for salmonids because ingested fluoride is largely absorbed by the skeleton.

JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY												Estuarine ecosystems are characterized by high zooplanktonic biomasses, essentially constituted by copepods and mysids whose nutritional requirements are mainly provided by phytoplankton, an easily available carbon form. The Gironde estuary is characterized by high turbidities which limit light penetration in the water column and therefore primary production. Consequently, primary production is low and its availability for higher trophic level is very limited. The main goal of this study was to characterize the total vegetal particulate organic matter (POM) in high turbidity zones of the Gironde estuary during summer (a critical period characterized by high heterotrophic bacterial degradation and high zooplanktonic biomasses) and to analyse its utilization by zooplankton, using prey/predator experiments and trophic biomarkers (fatty acids). The specific goals were to define (i) how vegetal POM was exploited by the different zooplanktonic groups (protozoa, copepods and mysids) and (ii) which alternative preys could be used when vegetal POM was not sufficient to ensure their nutritional requirements. Chlorophyll biomass was very low in the MTZ during summer 2002 (0.48 +/- 0.03 mg m(-3)). Total zooplankton grazing was low (19% d(-1)) probably due to a large contribution of detritus originating from terrestrial plants in vegetal POM compared to phytoplankton. The highest grazing pressure was exercised by the mysid Mesopodopsis slabberi due to its high abundances and by its almost entirely herbivorous diet (phytoplankton and small terrestrial detritus). Grazing rates (19.7 +/- 4.2 and 9.6 mu gC cop(-1) d(-1) for juveniles and adults, respectively) seemed to be sufficient to satisfy their daily carbon requirement. Grazing rate of the copepod Eurytemora affinis (139 ngC cop(-1) d(-1)) seemed to be insufficient to cover its nutritional requirements and the copepods probably needed to complete a great part of their diet from protozoa. Grazing rates of the mysid Neomysis integer (24.7 +/- 0.01 and 20.89 +/- 8.45 mu gC cop(-1) d(-1) for juveniles and adults, respectively) were higher than those of M. slabberi when feeding only on phytoplankton. However, when other preys were introduced in its environment, N. integer only fed on the copepod E. affinis with a preference for nauplii. The study revealed the great importance of protozoa and bacteria in the trophic transfers between vegetal POM and zooplankton in the MTZ during summer, despite the low protozoa grazing pressure on vegetal POM (3.1 %). The detritic food chain probably implies various trophic transfers with little direct relationships between vegetal POM and zooplankton. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Cellular Changes Associated with the Acclimation of the Intertidal Sea Anemone Actinia tenebrosa to Ultraviolet Radiation	PHOTOCHEMISTRY AND PHOTOBIOLOGY												To assess the relative importance of long- and short-term cellular defense mechanisms in seasonally UV-R-acclimated Actinia tenebrosa (Anthozoa, Actiniidae), individuals were exposed to summer doses of PAR, UV-A, UV-B and enhanced UV-B (20%) for a period of 4days. Mycosporine-like amino acids (MAAs) and cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer (CPD) concentrations were quantified, while oxidative damage to lipids and proteins, and the activities or levels of the antioxidant enzymes SOD, CAT, GR, GPOX and total glutathione were determined. Our results show that summer UV-R-acclimated individuals had a higher UV-R tolerance, with no significant increases in CPDs levels, than winter-acclimated sea anemones possibly due to higher MAA concentrations. Summer-acclimated individuals showed increased lipid and protein oxidation and GPOX activity only when they were exposed to UV-B at 20% above ambient UV-R levels. In contrast, winter-acclimated sea anemones showed elevated levels of oxidative damage, GPOX and SOD activities after exposure to UV-A or UV-B at ambient and elevated levels. Thus, this study indicates that long-term UV-R acclimation mechanisms such as the accumulation of MAAs could be more important than short-term increases in antioxidant defenses with respect to reducing indirect UV-R damage in intertidal sea anemones.

Adding the ocean to the study of seabirds: a brief history of at-sea seabird research	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												We review the history of how research directed towards marine ornithology has led to an appreciation of seabirds as highly specialized marine organisms. Beginning with R. C. Murphy (Pacific), V. C. Wynne-Edwards (Atlantic), and associates in the early 1900s, the research approach grew from an emphasis on seabird single-species ecology to an appreciation of interacting species assemblages and finally to seabirds being considered as important components of marine food webs. After a slow, drawn-out beginning, the initial main impetus for developing the field was a need to map seabird abundance and distribution tied to understanding impacts of continental shelf resource exploitation. Coalescing during the 1970s to 1980s to facilitate this line of research were 6 factors: (1) ability to identify birds at sea; (2) standardization of techniques to quantify abundance; (3) resources and techniques for mapping; (4) appreciation of how scale affects seabird relationships to hydrographic features and patchy prey; (5) development of computing power and appropriate statistics; and (6) seabird biologists becoming embedded in, as well as organizing, multidisciplinary marine research projects. Future advances in understanding the role of seabirds in marine food webs will be made by seabird biologists participating in multidisciplinary projects using grid-like surveys relative to oceanographic features in combination with instrumentation that reveals the finer details of seabird foraging behaviors.

A large number of studies document substantial impact of solar UV radiation on individual species, yet considerable uncertainty remains with respect to assessing impacts on ecosystems. Several studies indicate that the impact of increased UV radiation appears relatively low when considering overall ecosystem response, while, in contrast, effects on individual species show considerable responses. Ecosystem response to climate variability incorporates both synergistic and antagonistic processes with respect to UV-related effects, significantly complicating understanding and prediction at the ecosystem level. The impact of climate variability on UV-related effects often becomes manifest via indirect effects such as reduction in sea ice, changes in water column bio-optical characteristics, changes in cloud cover and shifts in oceanographic biogeochemical provinces.																	1474-905X	1474-9092				JAN	2003	2	1					39	50		10.1039/b211160h							WOS:000180797800007	12659538

Automated classification of schools of the silver cyprinid Rastrineobola argentea in Lake Victoria acoustic survey data using random forests	ICES JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE												Biomass of the schooling fish Rastrineobola argentea (dagaa) is presently estimated in Lake Victoria by acoustic survey following the simple "rule" that dagaa is the source of most echo energy returned from the top third of the water column. Dagaa have, however, been caught in the bottom two-thirds, and other species occur towards the surface: a more robust discrimination technique is required. We explored the utility of a school-based random forest (RF) classifier applied to 120kHz data from a lake-wide survey. Dagaa schools were first identified manually using expert opinion informed by fishing. These schools contained a lake-wide biomass of 0.68 million tonnes (MT). Only 43.4% of identified dagaa schools occurred in the top third of the water column, and 37.3% of all schools in the bottom two-thirds were classified as dagaa. School metrics (e.g. length, echo energy) for 49081 manually classified dagaa and non-dagaa schools were used to build an RF school classifier. The best RF model had a classification test accuracy of 85.4%, driven largely by school length, and yielded a biomass of 0.71 MT, only c. 4% different from the manual estimate. The RF classifier offers an efficient method to generate a consistent dagaa biomass time series.

J	Zhang, TT; Xu, J; Wang, YM; Xue, CH				Zhang, Tian-Tian; Xu, Jie; Wang, Yu-Ming; Xue, Chang-Hu			Health benefits of dietary marine DHA/EPA-enriched glycerophospholipids	PROGRESS IN LIPID RESEARCH												A typical feature of marine foods is that they are rich in docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), which have formed a large-scale global industry. DHA/EPA phospholipids (PLs) are ubiquitous in marine foods and are the main DHA/EPA molecular forms in fish roe, shrimp and shellfish. Much attention has been focused on the bioavailability and health benefits that are influenced by the type and esterified form of dietary fatty acids. Recently, numerous findings have suggested that dietary DHA/EPA-PLs are superior to the triacylglycerol (TAG) or ethyl ester forms in exerting their functional properties through specific mechanisms of action. However, there is no comprehensive review covering the health benefits of dietary marine DHA/EPA-enriched PLs. In this paper, we review publications on the nutritional functions of DHA/EPA-enriched glycerophospholipids, including the effects on brain function, antitumor activity, lipid metabolism, and glucose metabolism. The current research status regarding the active ingredients, sources, models, treatment, duration, and mechanisms are presented. In addition, the way in which the structure-activity relationship of DHA/EPA-PLs is affected by ester-bond structure at the sn-1 position, fatty acid at the sn-2 position and polar head group at the sn-3 position is also reviewed. DHA/EPA-PLs are one of the major n-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acid dietary forms in our diet, and we should maximize the ability to fully exploit the nutritional properties of DHA/EPA.																	0163-7827	1873-2194				JUL	2019	75								100997	10.1016/j.plipres.2019.100997							WOS:000487169700004	31442526

J	Lee, RF; Hagen, W; Kattner, G				Lee, RF; Hagen, W; Kattner, G			Lipid storage in marine zooplankton	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												Zooplankton storage lipids play an important role during reproduction, food scarcity, ontogeny and diapause, as shown by studies in various oceanic regions. While triacylglycerols, the primary storage lipid of terrestrial animals, are found in almost all zooplankton species, wax esters are the dominant storage lipid in many deep-living and polar zooplankton taxa. Phospholipids and diacylglycerol ethers are the unique storage lipids used by polar euphausiids and pteropods, respectively. In zooplankton with large stores of wax esters, triacylglycerols are more rapidly turned over and used for short-term energy needs, while wax esters serve as long-term energy deposits. Zooplankton groups found in polar, westerlies, upwelling and coastal biomes are characterized by accumulation of large lipid stores. In contrast, zooplankton from the trades/tropical biomes is mainly composed of omnivorous species with only small lipid reserves. Diapausing copepods, which enter deep water after feeding on phytoplankton during spring/summer blooms or at the end of upwelling periods, are characterized by large oil sacs filled with wax esters. The thermal expansion and compressibility of wax esters may allow diapausing copepods and other deep-water zooplankton to be neutrally buoyant in cold deep waters, and they can thus avoid spending energy to remain at these depths. Lipid droplets are often noted in zooplankton ovaries, and a portion of these droplets can be transferred to developing oocytes. In addition to lipid droplets, zooplankton eggs have yolks with lipovitellin, a lipoprotein with approximately equal amounts of protein and lipid. The lipovitellin lipid is predominantly phosphatidylcholine, so during reproduction females must convert a portion of their storage lipid into this phospholipid. Developing embryos use their lipovitellin and lipid droplets for energy and materials until feeding begins. The various functions storage lipids serve during the different life history stages of zooplankton are very complex and still not fully understood and hence offer a multitude of fascinating research perspectives.

Predictive systems ecology	PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES												Human societies, and their well-being, depend to a significant extent on the state of the ecosystems that surround them. These ecosystems are changing rapidly usually in response to anthropogenic changes in the environment. To determine the likely impact of environmental change on ecosystems and the best ways to manage them, it would be desirable to be able to predict their future states. We present a proposal to develop the paradigm of predictive systems ecology, explicitly to understand and predict the properties and behaviour of ecological systems. We discuss the necessary and desirable features of predictive systems ecology models. There are places where predictive systems ecology is already being practised and we summarize a range of terrestrial and marine examples. Significant challenges remain but we suggest that ecology would benefit both as a scientific discipline and increase its impact in society if it were to embrace the need to become more predictive.
