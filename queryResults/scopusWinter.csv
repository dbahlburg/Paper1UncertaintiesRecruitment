Identifying sea-ice characteristics that serve as indicators of habitat quality will be crucial to the monitoring and management of climate change impacts. In the Southern Ocean, Antarctic krill is a key prey species and fishery target. Krill larvae depend upon sea-ice habitats to survive the winter and recruit to the population in spring. Existing observations of sea-ice characteristics lack sufficient spatiotemporal coverage to quantify which ones contribute to favourable overwintering habitat, leading to uncertainties in how current and future changes in sea ice affect krill populations. Here, we derive regional-scale indices of annual krill recruitment spanning 35 years across the southwest Atlantic. To develop meaningful indicators of sea-ice habitat, we selected variables from a high-resolution sea-ice model that are hypothesized as relevant for larval habitat use. The resulting correlations between recruitment and sea-ice indicators vary by region and show remote connections to sea ice that correspond with established theories of larval transport. Through an improved representation of sea-ice habitat quality, as compared with using more traditional satellite-derived variables such as sea-ice extent and duration, we highlight plausible regions of overwintering habitat. Our findings improve current understanding of how krill are likely responding to changing sea ice and support emerging views that larval habitat use is complex. Furthermore, regional variation in larval dependence on sea ice may provide pockets of resilience to change for the broader krill population. © 2021",2-s2.0-85109067248

One of the earliest implementations was in the Southern Ocean, where decision rules and stock reference points were developed for managing the Antarctic krill fishery, together with an ecosystem-monitoring programme intended to aid management decisions. This latter component has not been incorporated directly into management, so here, we consider variability in the krill fishery at South Georgia, relating it to physical and biological monitoring indices, finding sea surface temperature to be a key correlate with both annual catch and long-term biological indices. Some indices from krill predators showed significant positive relationships with krill harvesting in the preceding winter, presumably indicative of the importance of winter foraging conditions. We explore how ecological structure affects results, examining two monitoring sites 100 km apart. Results suggest different biological conditions at the two sites, probably reflecting different scales of ecosystem operation, emphasizing that an appreciation of scale will enhance krill fishery management. Finally, in reviewing different drivers of ecological change, we identify important additional monitoring that would help better reflect ecosystem status, improve the utility of CEMP, providing information necessary for the ecosystem approach at South Georgia. © 2021 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea.",2-s2.0-85117364854

Due to the challenges of working in polar marine ecosystems, most knowledge on polar zooplankton community structure is derived from summer surveys. Here we examine the spatial distribution, abundance and community structure of macrozooplankton in relation to sea-ice and ocean-climate dynamics within the Antarctic Peninsula marine ecosystem over five consecutive winters. We compare the patterns revealed during winter with historical data collected in the same region during austral summer. Hydrographic and macrozooplankton data were collected from >100 standard stations off the northern Antarctic Peninsula during summer (2003–2011) and winter (2012–2016). Using multivariate methods, the environmental drivers and geographic structuring of the macrozooplankton community during winter and summer were investigated. Eight taxa made up 90% of total macrozooplankton abundance in winter including Metridia species, post-larval and larval Euphausia superba, post-larval Thysanoessa macrura, Limacina helicina, Chaetognatha, Ostracoda and Radiozoa. Eight slightly different taxa including Calanoides acutus, Salpa thompsoni, T. macrura (post-larvae and larvae), Metridia spp., E. superba larvae, Chaetognatha, and Rhincalanus spp. made up 87% of the total abundance in summer. Macrozooplankton clustered into five groups in winter and seven groups in summer. Winter macrozooplankton structure was more spatially consistent among years compared to summer regardless of sea-ice conditions. Salinity, chlorophyll a biomass, upper mixed layer depth and time of day were most strongly correlated with the multivariate ordination in winter whereas salinity, phaeopigment biomass and year had the highest correlations for summer, indicating the importance of similar physical features in both seasons. However, the importance of time scales differed among seasons. Although environmental determinants of summer and winter macrozooplankton community structure indicate that community structure and occurrence were strongly tied to regional variability of salinity and primary productivity gradients, macrozooplankton community structure is likely much more complex than only a few hydrographic variables can explain. Cluster boundaries are likely driven by dynamic locations of currents, fronts and localized eddies in any given season or year. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",2-s2.0-85108450604

To date, the potential implications of this population shift on the biogeochemical cycling of the limiting micronutrient iron (Fe) and its bioavailability to SO phytoplankton has never been tested. Based on uptake of fecal pellet (FP)-released Fe by SO phytoplankton, this study highlights how efficiently krill and salps recycle Fe. To test this, we collected FPs of natural populations of salps and krill, added them to the same SO phytoplankton community, and measured the community's Fe uptake rates. Our results reveal that both FP additions yielded similar dissolved iron concentrations in the seawater. Per FP carbon added to the seawater, 4.8 ± 1.5 times more Fe was taken up by the same phytoplankton community from salp FP than from krill FP, suggesting that salp FP increased the Fe bioavailability, possibly through the release of ligands. With respect to the ongoing shift from krill to salps, the potential for carbon fixation of the Fe-limited SO could be strengthened in the future, representing a negative feedback to climate change. © 2021 The Authors",2-s2.0-85109456715

We hypothesized that sea ice provides additional benefits because it hosts fewer competitors and provides reduced predation risk for krill larvae than the water column. To test our hypothesis, zooplankton were sampled in the Weddell-Scotia Confluence Zone at the ice-water interface (0–2 m) and in the water column (0–500 m) during August–October 2013. Grazing by mesozooplankton, expressed as a percentage of the phytoplankton standing stock, was higher in the water column (1.97 ± 1.84%) than at the ice-water interface (0.08 ± 0.09%), due to a high abundance of pelagic copepods. Predation risk by carnivorous macrozooplankton, expressed as a percentage of the mesozooplankton standing stock, was significantly lower at the ice-water interface (0.83 ± 0.57%; main predators amphipods, siphonophores and ctenophores) than in the water column (4.72 ± 5.85%; main predators chaetognaths and medusae). These results emphasize the important role of sea ice as a suitable winter habitat for larval krill with fewer competitors and lower predation risk. These benefits should be taken into account when considering the response of Antarctic krill to projected declines in sea ice. Whether reduced sea-ice algal production may be compensated for by increased water column production remains unclear, but the shelter provided by sea ice would be significantly reduced or disappear, thus increasing the predation risk on krill larvae. © 2021, The Author(s).",2-s2.0-85105880522

However, the molecular mechanisms generating these rhythms remain far from understood. The aim of this study was to investigate seasonal differences in gene expression in three different latitudinal regions (South Georgia, South Orkneys/Bransfield Strait, Lazarev Sea) and to identify genes with potential regulatory roles in the seasonal life cycle of Antarctic krill. The RNA-seq data were analysed (a) for seasonal differences between summer and winter krill sampled from each region, and (b) for regional differences within each season. A large majority of genes showed an up-regulation in summer krill in all regions with respect to winter krill. However, seasonal differences in gene expression were less pronounced in Antarctic krill from South Georgia, most likely due to the milder seasonal conditions of the lower latitudes of this region, with a less extreme light regime and food availability between summer and winter. Our results suggest that in the South Orkneys/Bransfield Strait and Lazarev Sea region, Antarctic krill entered a state of metabolic depression and regressed development (winter quiescence) in winter. Moreover, seasonal gene expression signatures seem to be driven by a photoperiodic timing system that may adapt the flexible behaviour and physiology of Antarctic krill to the highly seasonal environment according to the latitudinal region. However, at the lower latitude South Georgia region, food availability might represent the main environmental cue influencing seasonal physiology. © 2020 The Authors",2-s2.0-85089250022

However, understanding krill behavior, particularly in the poorly-studied autumn–winter seasons, is key for management and conservation. Here, we used seasonal video observations collected with a profiling camera system of krill along the Western Antarctic Peninsula to reveal krill vertical distribution, aggregation density and individual behaviors that have remained hidden from traditional sampling methods.3 Kane et al. used a lowered camera system to observe krill behaviors, including novel benthic feeding methods and links between individual behaviors and aggregation densities. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.",2-s2.0-85101899214

There was a negative relationship between antecedent winter sea surface temperature (SST) in the Southern Ocean on foetus size. This relationship is proposed as being mediated by a positive effect of the extent of winter sea ice on Antarctic krill (Euphasia superba) abundance on which B. m. intermedia feed. There was also a positive density-dependent effect of a ""krill surplus"" at low B. m. intermedia population sizes. However, the positive effect of a ""krill surplus"" at low B. m. intermedia population size on foetus growth was reversed at elevated winter SST due to a proposed negative impact on E. superba recruitment.

With SERBIK (SEasonally Regulated BIoenergetic Krill growth model), we conduct a numerical experiment which tests the impact of such scaling on krill life history under two different winter food conditions: In the first scenario, we simulate life history of krill when winter food availability is low; in the second scenario, winter food availability is increased within realistic ranges. The results demonstrate that the scaling of metabolism is especially important during low food winters. Reducing metabolism during winter permits individuals to grow to larger body length, reproduce successfully and release a greater number of eggs. It further significantly reduces within-year size fluctuations caused by starvation during months with low food availability.

To better understand how this species has responded to large-scale changes, we tracked individuals during the non-breeding winter period from five colonies across the latitudinal range of breeding sites in the WAP, including from a recently established colony. Results highlight latitudinal gradients in movement; strong associations with shallow, coastal habitats along the entire Antarctic Peninsula; and movements that are independent of, yet constrained by, sea ice.

We considered DVM in relation to krill body length, based on Japanese krill fishery data (1990−2012), and examined DVM in relation to food availability and predator (Antarctic fur seal) avoidance. We report that diel changes in median trawling depth (a proxy for krill vertical distribution) showed significant interannual variation; the overall trend was such that during both daytime and nighttime, the larger the average size of krill, the deeper their median depth. Consistent with the literature, this size-dependent DVM relates to food availability and size-dependent diet; that is, with increasing body length, krill tend to rely less on phytoplankton (which are available in surface layers) as a winter food source. Concerning predator avoidance, and based on analyses using an optimal foraging dive model for fur seals, DVM showed close agreement with size-dependent predation risk; that is, larger krill remained deeper, thereby reducing mortality from fur seals. Therefore, DVM of overwintering krill appears to reflect a compromise between adequate feeding conditions and minimizing predation risk. There was, however, an exception that krill occurred at a shallow depth in winter 2006 when phytoplankton abundance was particularly low and krill density was very high. This supports the hypothesis that physiological demands (i.e. hunger) may become a more important factor affecting DVM than predator avoidance under conditions of insufficient food availability. © Inter-Research 2020.",2-s2.0-85096303934

Few winter studies exist from which to infer impacts of changing environmental conditions on the biology of krill. Here demographic and maturity patterns of krill during five winters are examined at an overwintering hotspot in the northern Antarctic Peninsula. Two different recruitment pulses were present over the 5 years of the study. A large recruitment event was evident in winter 2012, followed by cohort growth tracked through winter 2014. A recruitment event also occurred in 2015, despite lower abundance of larvae in 2013 and 2014. The recruitment pulse in 2015 was correlated with the intrusion of high salinity water, characteristic of the Weddell Sea, during a positive El Niño–Southern Oscillation phase, suggesting recruitment was driven by advection of recruits into the northern Antarctic Peninsula. Despite the inter-annual environmental variability, most female krill were in resting reproductive stages in all years. The lack of variability in female reproductive status during winter may impose a developmental constraint to earlier spawning than previously considered; the time necessary to advance from resting stages to reproductive maturity may limit the ability of krill to adapt to trends in the timing and magnitude of the spring bloom. The observed patterns of recruitment and variation in maturity stages highlight the complexity of krill population dynamics and should be considered when projecting population responses of Antarctic krill to climate-driven changes in the Southern Ocean. © 2020, This is a U.S. Government work and not under copyright protection in the US; foreign copyright protection may apply.",2-s2.0-85089187421

While salp abundance is hypothesized to increase, krill abundance is hypothesized to decline with dramatic consequences for the entire food web of the Southern Ocean. A better understanding of the biotic interaction between krill and salps and their population dynamics is thus crucial. However, the life cycle of salps is complicated and barely understood. Therefore, we have developed an individual-based model describing the whole life cycle to better understand the population dynamics of salps and the conditions for blooms. The model has been used to explore if and under what conditions the empirical pattern of large variability in observed salp abundances at the WAP, generated by the long-term data of the US Antarctic Marine Living Resources Program (AMLR) can emerge from a small seeding population. The model reproduced this empirical pattern if daily growth rates of oozoids were higher than previously reported for the WAP (mean growth rate for oozoids ~ 1 mm d−1) and if growth rates of blastozooids were lower (mean growth rate ~ 0.2 mm d−1). The model suggests that a prerequisite for local salp blooms requires a small founding population in early spring. With climate change it has been suggested that more frequent and earlier transport of salps into the WAP or winter survival will occur. Hence, the risk of salp blooms in the WAP is likely to substantially increase. These findings highlight the importance for an improved quantitative understanding of how primary production and the southward advection of salps will be impacted by climate change. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",2-s2.0-85084937899

Diet indicators (lipid content, ?15N, ?13C, and the fatty acid ratios 16:1n-7/18:4n-3 and 18:1n-9/18:1n-7) in postlarvae were consistent among years regardless of seaice cover, suggesting that post-larval krill do not rely on sea-ice resources for overwinter survival. Diet indicators in larvae were more variable and suggest that larvae may feed on sea-ice resources when they are available but can still persist in the water column when they are not. Principal component analysis between environmental variables and diet indicators showed that water-column chl a was the only variable that significantly affected diet, regardless of annual changes in sea-ice cover. Extensive winter ice in one year did not translate into successful recruitment the following year. Krill demonstrate a high degree of flexibility with respect to overwinter habitat and diet, and the degree to which sea ice is important during different times of year and at different life stages may be more complex than previously thought. © 2020 Inter-Research.

More specifically, we examined how sea-ice concentration and free-drifting icebergs affect the distribution of Antarctic petrels. After breeding, birds moved north to the marginal ice zone (MIZ) in theWeddell sector of the Southern Ocean, following its northward extension during freeze-up in April, and they wintered there in April-August. There, the birds stayed predominantly out of the water (60-80% of the time) suggesting they use icebergs as platforms to stand on and/or to rest. Feather δ15N values encompassed one full trophic level, indicating that birds fed on various proportions of crustaceans and fish/squid, most likely Antarctic krill Euphausia superba and the myctophid fish Electrona antarctica and/or the squid Psychroteuthis glacialis. Birds showed strong affinity for the open waters of the northern boundary of the MIZ, an important iceberg transit area, which offers roosting opportunities and rich prey fields.

Understanding of the characteristics and dynamics of water masses in the euphotic zone can provide basic information for oceanographic research, and also provide scientific support for the distribution and habitat of pelagic organisms, such as the Antarctic krill. In this study, we analyzed temperature and salinity profile data collected from the euphotic zone along five transects around the South Shetland Islands between January and March 2013.

In a year-long laboratory experiment adult krill were exposed to ambient seawater pCO2 levels (400 μatm), elevated pCO2 levels mimicking near-future ocean acidification (1000, 1500 and 2000 μatm) and an extreme pCO2 level (4000 μatm).

Fatty acid composition (%) and fatty acid ratios associated with immune responses and cell membrane fluidity were also unaffected by near-future pCO2, apart from an increase in 18:3n-3/18:2n-6 ratios in krill in 1500 μatm pCO2 in winter and spring. Extreme pCO2 had no effect on krill lipid biochemistry during summer. During winter and spring, krill in extreme pCO2 had elevated levels of 18:2n-6 (up to 1.2% increase), 20:4n-6 (up to 0.8% increase), lower 18:3n-3/18:2n-6 and 20:5n-3/20:4n-6 ratios, and showed evidence of increased membrane fluidity (up to three-fold increase in phospholipid/sterol ratios).

However, questions have been raised about using fatty acids as dietary indicators from whole lipid samples, rather than from separate lipid classes. A drawback of scientific field-based studies is that samples are rarely collected over extended periods, precluding seasonal dietary comparisons. We used fisheries samples obtained over one year to investigate seasonal variations in the fatty acid composition of separated phospholipids and triacylglycerols of Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba). Seasonal variation was observed in fatty acid biomarkers within triacylglycerol and phospholipid fractions of krill. Fatty acids in krill triacylglycerols (thought to best represent recent diet), reflected omnivorous feeding with highest percentages of flagellate biomarkers (18:4n-3) in summer, and diatom biomarkers (16:1n-7c) in autumn, winter and spring. Carnivory biomarkers (∑ 20:1 + 22:1 and 18:1n-9c/18:1n-7c) in krill were higher in autumn. Phospholipid fatty acids were less variable and higher in 20:5n-3 and 22:6n-3, which are essential components of cell membranes. Sterol composition did not yield detailed dietary information, but percentages and quantities of cholesterol, the major krill sterol, were significantly higher in winter and spring compared with summer and autumn. Copepod markers ∑ 20:1 + 22:1 were not strongly associated with the triacylglycerol fraction during some seasons, and neither was 18:4n-3. Krill might mobilise 18:4n-3 from triacylglycerols to phospholipids for conversion to long-chain (≥ C20) polyunsaturated fatty acids, which would have implications for its role as a dietary biomarker.

To quantify the importance of this ‘sympagic carbon’ during summer, the three most abundant Antarctic euphausiids, Euphausia superba, E. crystallorophias, and Thysanoessa macrura, collected off the Filchner Ice Shelf, were analyzed regarding their fatty acid (FA) and stable isotope compositions. Fingerprints of diatom- and dinoflagellate-associated FAs in the euphausiids indicated a mixed carbon source composition for all three species. Bulk and FA-specific carbon stable isotope compositions (δ13C) were used to quantify the contribution of sympagic carbon versus phytoplankton-produced carbon to the euphausiids’ carbon budget, suggesting a lower proportional contribution of sympagic carbon in E. superba (5–18%) compared to E. crystallorophias (16–36%) and T. macrura (15–36%). The latter two species probably received sympagic carbon through heterotrophic prey, a hitherto overlooked source of sympagic carbon for pelagic species. Euphausiids collected close to the surface indicated a higher importance of sympagic carbon to their carbon budget compared to individuals caught at greater depths. Our results imply that, in the southern Weddell Sea, ice algae play a significant, but possibly not critical role as a carbon source for the three euphausiids during summer. Their ability to utilize carbon of different origins implies a certain resilience to environmental change during summer. The winter period, however, remains the critical bottle neck of survival when Antarctic sea ice declines, because during this season of minimal pelagic productivity, ice algae standing stocks constitute the only dependable carbon source. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",2-s2.0-85065880106

We consider the importance of a range of recruitment factors using an environmentally driven model of larval development from spawning to post-larvae. Our model examines the timing of spawning, interaction with bathymetry, susceptibility to cold temperatures, temperature-driven development and the seasonal cycle of sea ice to identify those factors with the greatest impact. The model predicts that the seasonal location of sea ice is the main limiting factor for successful larval recruitment. Spawning in January leads to the greatest area of viable larval recruitment habitat. Dense sea ice cover, which we assume that adult krill do not spawn under, prevents spawning in large areas early in the breeding season (December). Nevertheless, later spawning in February, when sea ice is at a minimum, means there is often insufficient time for the larvae to reach a viable developmental stage before the sea ice advances. Meanwhile, although spawning is possible in more northerly areas throughout the breeding season, these are generally remote from winter sea ice, which is assumed to be necessary for larvae to overwinter. Interaction with bathymetry before hatching further limits suitable habitat. Over a 12 yr period, the model predicted larval re - cruitment from January spawning in all years in the Cooperation, Ross and Weddell Seas, with episodic larval recruitment in the Bransfield Strait in 9 of the 12 years. Additional understanding of the overwintering requirements of larvae, together with regional studies at higher spatial resolution, particularly in shelf regions, will better constrain the uncertainties in the model. © 2019 Inter-Research.

A diet rich in ice algae would promote growth and reproductive development. The Bransfield Strait (northern Antarctic Peninsula, AP) is an important overwintering ground for krill; it has been proposed this region offers a food-rich winter environment. We examined the contribution of ice algae to the energy budget of overwintering juvenile krill during 2 years with contrasting sea ice conditions. Grazing on ice algae contributed 146% to their winter energy budget in 2015, even though ice concentrations were 50% and consisted of newly formed pancake ice.

Iron emanating from its shelf system fuels large phytoplankton blooms downstream of the island, but the actual supply mechanisms are unclear. To address this, we present an inventory of Fe, manganese (Mn), and aluminium (Al) in shelf sediments, pore waters, and the water column in the vicinity of South Georgia, alongside data on zooplankton-mediated Fe cycling processes, and provide estimates of the relative dissolved Fe (DFe) fluxes from these sources. Seafloor sediments, modified by authigenic Fe precipitation, were the main particulate Fe source to shelf bottom waters as indicated by the similar Fe =Mn and Fe = Al ratios for shelf sediments and suspended particles in the water column. Less than 1% of the total particulate Fe pool was leachable surface-adsorbed (labile) Fe and therefore potentially available to organisms. Pore waters formed the primary DFe source to shelf bottom waters, supplying 0.1-44 μmol DFem-2 d-1. However, we estimate that only 0:41±0:26 μmol DFem-2 d-1 was transferred to the surface mixed layer by vertical diffusive and advective mixing. Other trace metal sources to surface waters included glacial flour released by melting glaciers and via zooplankton egestion and excretion processes. On average 6:5±8:2 μmolm-2 d-1 of labile particulate Fe was supplied to the surface mixed layer via faecal pellets formed by Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba), with a further 1:1±2:2 μmol DFem-2 d-1 released directly by the krill. The faecal pellets released by krill included seafloor-derived lithogenic and authigenic material and settled algal debris, in addition to freshly ingested suspended phytoplankton cells. The Fe requirement of the phytoplankton blooms ∼ 1250 km downstream of South Georgia was estimated as 0:33±0:11 μmolm-2 d-1, with the DFe supply by horizontal/ vertical mixing, deep winter mixing, and aeolian dust estimated as ∼ 0:12 μmolm-2 d-1. We hypothesize that a substantial contribution of DFe was provided through recycling of biogenically stored Fe following luxury Fe uptake by phytoplankton on the Fe-rich shelf. This process would allow Fe to be retained in the surface mixed layer of waters downstream of South Georgia through continuous recycling and biological uptake, supplying the large downstream phytoplankton blooms. © Author(s) 2018.",2-s2.0-85052675809

The trophic information for this species during the transition from the austral fall to the winter is important to understand its poorly known overwintering mechanisms. However, the few studies on the topic differ in their results, in terms of both spatial and temporal variables. We investigated the size dependence and monthly and regional variation in δ13C and δ15N values of adult krill in the Antarctic Peninsula, in the austral fall (April to May) and the early winter (June). We aimed to examine the trophic variations of krill occurred during this period, and the relationship between krill and their feeding environment in the Antarctic marine ecosystem. The following results were obtained: (1) no significant relationship was observed between size and the δ13C value of krill, but the δ15N value of krill presented a remarkable association with size; (2) the δ13C values of krill increased during the austral fall, but no remarkable variation existed at the onset of winter, and the δ15N values were not significant different during this period; (3) mean δ15N values of krill differed significantly between the Bransfield Strait and the South Shetland Islands.

Although the adaptive significance of this seasonal metabolic shift seems obvious, the driving factors are still unclear. In particular, it is debated whether the seasonal metabolic cycle is driven by changes in food availability, or if an endogenous timing system entrained by photoperiod might be involved. In this study, we used different long-term photoperiodic simulations to examine the influence of light regime and endogenous rhythmicity on the regulation of krill seasonal metabolic cycle. Krill showed a seasonal cycle of growth characterized by null-to-negative growth rates during autumn-winter and positive growth rates during spring-summer, which was manifested also in constant darkness, indicating strong endogenous regulation. Similar endogenous cycles were observed for the activity of the key-metabolic enzyme malate dehydrogenase (MDH) and for the expression levels of a selection of metabolic-related genes, with higher values in spring-summer and lower values in autumn-winter. On the other side, a seasonal cycle of oxygen consumption was observed only when krill were exposed to simulated seasonal changes in photoperiod, indicating that light-related cues might play a major role in the regulation of krill oxygen consumption. The influence of light-regime on oxygen consumption was minimal during winter, when light-phase duration was below 8 h, and it was maximal during summer, when light-phase duration was above 16 h. Significant upregulation of the krill clock genes clk, cry2, and tim1, as well as of the circadian-related opsins rh1a and rrh, was observed after light-phase duration had started to decrease in early autumn, suggesting the presence of a signaling cascade linking specific seasonal changes in the Antarctic light regime with clock gene activity and the regulation of krill metabolic dormancy over the winter. © 2018 Piccolin, Suberg, King, Kawaguchi, Meyer and Teschke.",2-s2.0-85086081194

The Southern Ocean is roughly the size of Africa and experiences exceptional seasonality. Its many habitats include the permanently open ocean, sea ice, frontal systems and neritic waters, and different zonal (east-west) and meridional (north-south) regions are on different trajectories in terms of climate, sea ice cover and biological populations. The Western Antarctic Peninsula has experienced substantial warming, loss of sea ice and declining Adélie penguin populations, while eastern Antarctica has cooled, shown increased ice cover and increasing numbers of Adélies. In the ocean itself, warming seems to be concentrated north of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current and at depth rather than in surface waters. Densities of Antarctic krill are correlated with ice cover in the previous winter and in the south-west Atlantic have decreased over the last century while salps have shown increasing numbers south of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current. Even in this example, the mechanisms involved are uncertain, making predictions difficult. The historic loss of an enormous biomass of consumers through fisheries, led to top-down ecological effects including competitive release among predators. These pelagic food webs are, however, strongly physically forced, making them particularly vulnerable to changes in environmental conditions. The size and species composition of the primary producers affect food chain length and the efficiency of the biological pump. Critically, the primary producer community is profoundly shaped by factors influencing the availability of light (e.g. season, ice melt and water column stability), micro and macronutrients. Changes in these will have deeply important bottom-up effects, and this brings us to defining biogeography. In these pelagic systems, biogeographic provinces are defined by the frontal systems that delineate sharp discontinuities in conditions in the water column and the taxa that dominate primary production. Because these are not geographically fixed, changes in biogeography in this context describe the expansion, contraction or simple displacement of biomes. The associated food webs revolve around a small number of key species that differ among habitats and biomes. They are not simple, exhibit considerable flexibility and include a number of taxa, particularly the cephalopods, that are difficult to sample and remain poorly studied. A major difficulty in understanding how climate change is likely to manifest is the brevity of relevant datasets. We have few physical or biological benchmarks to use in separating short-term noise from long-term signal. As a physical example, Southern Ocean fronts can exhibit short-term meridional shifts of >100 km in a matter of weeks. Biologically, regional differences in trajectories of Adélie penguin numbers need to be viewed against the background of substantial variability over the last 45,000 years. Except for ice or sediment cores, such data are available for few variables or species. In addition, research efforts are geographically unbalanced for logistic reasons. Remote sensing and the Argo float programme reduce this problem by increasing spatial coverage enormously for some variables, but not others, and even then offer relatively new time series. Important variables that are undergoing, or will undergo, change include: Sea ice cover (essentially habitat loss), sea temperatures, wind and mixing regimes, the positions of fronts, ultraviolet levels and ocean pH. Many of these will have interacting effects, and the areas likely to be exposed to multiple environmental changes far exceed those already experiencing important changes. Species are potentially vulnerable to stressors at all ontogenetic stages and in many cases sublethal effects (e.g. on reproductive success) are likely to affect population dynamics before stressors reach lethal levels. Likely, and complicated, will be possible changes to the microbial plankton, including increased microbe deposition by aeolian dust and greater susceptibility of potential hosts to viral infection because of other stresses. All these stressors can have direct and interacting effects as well as indirect effects. For example, meridional shifts in frontal positions will alter the foraging ranges of top predators that are land-based during the breeding season. The ecosystem-level consequences will depend on individual species reactions, including the rates at which they can respond and stressors to which they respond, with the potential disruption of species interactions through different phenological responses. Perhaps the key characteristic of predictions for the effects of climate change on the Southern Ocean lies in an even greater degree of uncertainty than the norm. © S. J. Hawkins, A. J. Evans, A. C.

Seasonal changes in photoperiod in Antarctica, ranging from midnight sun (24 h light) during mid-summer to very short days (3-4 h light) during mid-winter, represent a challenge for the synchronization of the krill circadian clock. We analyzed clock gene activity and clock output functions in krill exposed to different light conditions during a long-term photoperiodic simulation in the laboratory. In simulated early-autumn (light/dark or LD 16:8) and late-winter (LD 8:16) conditions, the circadian clock of krill was functional and the metabolic output was synchronized to the light/dark cycle, the clock genes Esper and Esclk peaked in antiphase around simulated dusk/dawn and most metabolic-related genes showed upregulation around simulated dusk. In contrast, in simulated mid-summer (light/light or LL) and mid-winter (LD 3:21) conditions, the synchronization of the circadian clock and the metabolic output appeared to be weaker, with clock gene expression becoming arrhythmic and upregulation of metabolic genes occurring at different times during the day. Early-autumn and late-winter photoperiodic cues in the laboratory thus seem to be sufficient to entrain the krill clock and promote metabolic synchronization, whereas mid-winter and mid-summer photoperiodic cues seem to be insufficient for krill entrainment. Krill in the field may overcome the seasonal lack of overt photoperiodic cycle occurring during mid-summer and mid-winter by using alternative light-related Zeitgebers (i.e., varying light intensity rather than the presence or absence of light) to promote basic homeostatic rhythms over 24 h. © 2018 The Author(s) 2018.

Age information for Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) will be important for stock assessment modeling and future feedback management of krill fisheries. Samples stored in 70% ethanol provide an opportunity to detect the growth bands of eyestalk sections. Moreover, information derived from samples preserved in formalin will have a greater impact on the feedback management process because this preservation method was more common in previous decades. Out of 162 Antarctic krill individuals preserved in 5% formalin, the growth bands from eyestalk sections of 134 samples were readable. The relationship between the total length and the growth bands in the eyestalk was analyzed. Three main parameters, including exact percent agreement (EPA), coefficient of variation (CV), and average percentage error (APE), were used to evaluate the precision of the growth bands.Results show decreased CV and APE values and an increase in the EPA value with the accumulation of reading runs. This method is direct and uses a grinding and polishing technique before reading, contrary to Krafft et al. (2016) and Kilada et al. (2017). Combined with published studies, specimens collected from autumn to winter in this study can provide a better understanding of Antarctic krill growth. This study presents important information for age determination, particularly for specimens preserved in formalin, and will benefit the stock assessment and acoustic estimation of this species in the future. Further studies are required to validate the correlation between growth bands and age. Additionally, more samples from different seasons and regions are also needed to fully understand the growth dynamics of this species. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",2-s2.0-85030331221

In contrast, the more open marginal ice zone provides a more favourable food environment for high larval krill growth rates. We found that complex under-ice habitats are, however, vital for larval krill when water column productivity is limited by light, by providing structures that offer protection from predators and to collect organic material released from the ice. The larvae feed on this sparse ice-associated food during the day. After sunset, they migrate into the water below the ice (upper 20 m) and drift away from the ice areas where they have previously fed.

We studied the spatio-temporal variability of the diet in 4 cohorts of AC0 krill in the Northern Weddell Sea during late winter 2013 using stomach contents, fatty acids (FAs) and bulk stable isotope analysis (BSIA). Stomach contents were dominated by diatoms in numbers and occasionally contained large volumes of copepods. Many of the prey species found in the stomachs were sea ice-associated. Our results show that the diet of overwintering AC0 krill varies significantly in space and time. Variability in stomach content composition was related to environmental factors, including chlorophyll a concentration, copepod abundance and sea-ice cover. In contrast, FA composition mainly varied between cohorts, indicating variation in the long-term diet.

The future resilience of krill to climate change depends critically on the winter survival of young krill. To survive periods of extremely low production by pelagic algae during winter, krill are assumed to rely partly on carbon produced by ice algae. The true dependency on ice algae-produced carbon, however, is so far unquantified. This confounds predictions on the future resilience of krill stocks to sea ice decline. Fatty acid (FA) analysis, bulk stable isotope analysis (BSIA), and compound-specific stable isotope analysis (CSIA) of diatom- and dinoflagellate-associated marker FAs were applied to quantify the dependency of overwintering larval, juvenile, and adult krill on ice algae-produced carbon (aIce) during winter 2013 in the Weddell-Scotia Confluence Zone. Our results demonstrate that the majority of the carbon uptake of the overwintering larval and juvenile krill originated from ice algae (up to 88% of the carbon budget), and that the dependency on ice algal carbon decreased with ontogeny, reaching < 56% of the carbon budget in adults. Spatio-temporal variability in the utilization of ice algal carbon was more pronounced in larvae and juvenile krill than in adults. Differences between aIce estimates derived from short- vs. long-term FA-specific isotopic compositions suggested that ice algae-produced carbon gained importance as the winter progressed, and might become critical at the late winter-spring transition, before the phytoplankton bloom commences. Where the sea ice season shortens, reduced availability of ice algae might possibly not be compensated by surplus phytoplankton production during wintertime. Hence, sea ice decline could seriously endanger the winter survival of recruits, and subsequently overall biomass of krill. © 2017 Kohlbach, Lange, Schaafsma, David, Vortkamp, Graeve, van Franeker, Krumpen and Flores.",2-s2.0-85030151428

Research cruises conducted around the South Shetland Islands of the Antarctic Peninsula during winters with contrasting ice conditions provide the first acoustic estimates of krill biomass, habitat use, and association with top predators to examine potential interactions with the krill fishery. Krill abundance was very low in offshore waters during all winters. In Bransfield Strait, median krill abundance was an order of magnitude higher (8 krill m-2) compared to summer (0.25 krill m-2), and this pattern was observed in all winters regardless of ice cover. Acoustic estimates of krill biomass were also an order of magnitude higher (∼5 500 000 metric tons [t] in 2014) than a 15 yr summer average (520 000 t). Looking at krilldependent predators, during winter, crabeater seals Lobodon carcinophagus were concentrated in Bransfield Strait where ice provided habitat, while Antarctic fur seals Arctocephalus gazella were more broadly distributed. Krill overwinter in coastal basin environments independent of ice and primary production and in an area that is becoming more frequently icefree.

In this context, we tested the ""Intersexual Competition Hypothesis"" for penguins by investigating the feeding ecology of Gentoo penguins during their austral winter non-breeding season. We considered this during unusual environmental conditions (i.e. the year 2009 had observations of high sea surface and air temperatures) in comparison with the long term average at Bird Island, South Georgia. Through conventional (i.e. stomach contents) and stable isotopic values from red blood cells, plasma and feathers of both male and female Gentoo penguins, we showed that there were significant differences between sexes, with males feeding mainly on fish (54% by mass) followed by crustaceans (38%) whereas females fed mainly on crustaceans (89% by mass) followed by fish (4%). Themisto gaudichaudii was the most important crustacean prey for males (64% by mass; 82% by number; 53% by frequency of occurrence) and females (63% by mass; 77% by number; 89% by frequency of occurrence), contrasting with all previous studies that found Antarctic krill Euphausia superba were generally the main prey. Stable isotopic data showed that, in terms of habitat use (based on ä13 C), there were significant differences in short-term carbon signatures between males and females (based on plasma and red blood cells), suggesting that both sexes explored different habitats, with females exploring more offshore pelagic waters and males feeding more in coastal benthic waters. Based on ä15 N, males fed on significantly higher trophic level than females (based on plasma and red blood cells), in agreement with our diet results., Thus, Gentoo penguins behave in a similar manner to other non-breeding penguins species (e.g. king, macaroni and rockhopper penguins), albeit at a smaller spatial scale (as they do not disperse as these other penguins do), in that they have a wider habitat and trophic niche during the Antarctic Winter (in comparison to Summer). We also detected individual specialization in feeding/ trophic levels for each gender, with certain males feeding mainly on fish and certain females mainly on crustaceans, which may be driven the prevailing environmental conditions that lead individuals to search for alternative prey, and cause sexual diet segregation.

Evidence for such migrations arises from seasonality of historic whaling catches by latitude, Discovery and natural mark returns, and results of satellite tagging studies. Feeding is generally believed to be limited to the southern polar region, where Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) has been identified as the primary prey item. Non-migrations and / or suspended migrations to the polar feeding grounds have previously been reported from a summer presence of whales in the Benguela System, where feeding on euphausiids (E. lucens), hyperiid amphipods (Themisto gaudichaudii), mantis shrimp (Pterygosquilla armata capensis) and clupeid fish has been described. Three recent research cruises (in October/November 2011, October/November 2014 and October/November 2015) identified large tightly-spaced groups (20 to 200 individuals) of feeding humpback whales aggregated over at least a one-month period across a 220 nautical mile region of the southern Benguela System. Feeding behaviour was identified by lunges, strong milling and repetitive and consecutive diving behaviours, associated bird and seal feeding, defecations and the pungent ""fishy"" smell of whale blows. Although no dedicated prey sampling could be carried out within the tightly spaced feeding aggregations, observations of E. lucens in the region of groups and the full stomach contents of mantis shrimp from both a co-occurring predatory fish species (Thyrsites atun) and one entangled humpback whale mortality suggest these may be the primary prey items of at least some of the feeding aggregations. Reasons for this recent novel behaviour pattern remain speculative, but may relate to increasing summer humpback whale abundance in the region. These novel, predictable, inter-annual, low latitude feeding events provide considerable potential for further investigation of Southern Hemisphere humpback feeding behaviours in these relatively accessible low-latitude waters.",2-s2.0-85014407343

The nature of this interaction is poorly understood, particularly during the critical period of winter–spring transition. To investigate the role of sea-ice and underlying water-column properties in structuring under-ice communities during late winter/early spring, we used a Surface and Under Ice Trawl to sample animals and environmental properties in the upper 2-m layer under the sea ice in the northern Weddell Sea from August to October 2013. The area of investigation was largely homogeneous in terms of hydrography and sea-ice coverage. We hypothesised that this apparent homogeneity in the physical regime was mirrored in the structure of the under-ice community. The under-ice community was numerically dominated by the copepods Stephos longipes, Ctenocalanus spp. and Calanus propinquus (altogether 67 %), and furcilia larvae of Antarctic krill Euphausia superba (30 %). In spite of the apparent homogeneity of the environment, abundance and biomass distributions at our sampling stations indicated the presence of three community types, following a geographical gradient in the investigation area: (1) high biomass, krill-dominated in the west, (2) high abundance, copepod-dominated in the east, and (3) low abundance, low biomass at the ice edge. Combined analysis with environmental data indicated that under-ice community structure was correlated with sea-ice coverage, chlorophyll a concentration, and bottom depth. The heterogeneity of the Antarctic under-ice community was probably also driven by other factors, such as advection, sea-ice drift, and seasonal progression. The response of under-ice communities to changing sea-ice habitats may thus considerably vary seasonally and regionally. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",2-s2.0-85010711337

During winter Pleuragramma antarcticum was dominant, while myctophids were almost absent. Conversely, in summer Electrona antarctica and Gymnoscopelus nicholsi, followed by P. antarcticum, dominated the fish diet.

The results indicated that higher CPUEs were distributed in the first 10 days of July to the last 10 days of August. The highest mean CPUE was 20.5±21.1 t·h-1 in 2014, and the lowest mean CPUE was 10.4±10.5 t·h-1 in 2015. A significant difference was also found in average CPUE values among months.

The spatial effect (positive correla- tion) of fishing depth on CPUE of Antarctic krill fishery was strengthened increasingly from south to north, but no consistent trend was observed for the spatial effect of bottom depth on CPUE. The goodness of fit for GWR model was higher than that of ordinary least square (OLS) model, indicating that GWR model was more suitable to present the spatial effect of drivers on CPUE.

One difficulty in advancing EBFM is parameterizing clear functional responses of predators to indices of prey availability. Alternative characterizations of fishery-predator interactions may therefore benefit the implementation of EBFM. Telemetry data identify foraging areas used by predators and, therefore, represent critical information to mitigate potential competition between predators and fisheries. We analyzed six years (2009±2014) of telemetry data collected at Cape Shirreff, Livingston Island and Admiralty Bay, King George Island, Antarctica, on three species of Pygoscelid penguins and female Antarctic fur seals. In this region, all four species are primarily dependent on Antarctic krill. The tracking data demonstrate local movements near breeding colonies during the austral summer and dispersal from breeding colonies during the winter. We then assessed overlap between predators and the Antarctic krill fishery on a suite of spatiotemporal scales to examine how different data aggregations affect the extent and location of overlap. Concurrent overlap was observed on all spatiotemporal scales considered throughout the Antarctic Peninsula and South Orkney Islands region, including near tagging locations and in distant areas where recent fishing activity has concentrated. Overlap occurred at depths where mean krill densities were relatively high. Our results demonstrate that direct overlap of krill-dependent predators with the krill fishery on small spatiotemporal scales is relatively common throughout the Antarctic Peninsula region. As the krill fishery continues to develop and efforts to implement ecosystem-based management mature, indices of overlap may provide a useful metric for indicating where the risks of fishing are highest. A precautionary approach to allocating krill catches in space would be to avoid large increases in catch where overlap on small spatiotemporal scales is common. © This is an open access article, free of all copyright, and may be freely reproduced, distributed, transmitted, modified, built upon, or otherwise used by anyone for any lawful purpose.

Nephrops are sold either whole, or as ""tails-only"" for the scampi trade. In the ""tailing"" process, the ""head"" (cephalothorax) is discarded as waste. A smaller crustacean species, the Antarctic krill Euphasia superba, represents an economically valuable industry, as its extractable oil is sold as a human dietary supplement. The aim of this study was to determine the amount and composition of the oil contained in discarded Nephrops heads and to compare its composition to the oil extracted from krill. Differences due to Geographical variation and seasonal patterns in the amount and composition of lipid were also noted. Results indicated that Nephrops head waste samples collected from more southern locations in Scotland (Clyde Sea area) contained higher levels of oil when compared to samples collected from northern locations in Iceland. Moreover, seasonal differences within the Clyde Sea area in Scotland were also observed, with oil extracted from Nephrops head waste peaking at around 11.5% during the summer months when larger and more mature females were caught by trawl. At this time of the year, the valuable fatty acids eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) accounted for around 23% of the total fatty acid content in oil extracted from Nephrops head waste. A seasonal effect on EPA content was found, with higher levels obtained in the summer, while no trend was found in DHA percentages. Finally, oil from Nephrops head waste contained a higher proportion of EPA and DHA than krill oil but these fatty acids were more abundantly linked to the neutral lipids rather to than polar lipids. The characterization of lipid that could be extracted from Nephrops head waste should be seen as a first step for the commercial use of a valuable resource currently wasted. This approach is extremely relevant given the current limited supply of EPA and DHA and changes in the Common Fisheries Policy. © 2016 The Author(s).",2-s2.0-85007470624

However, there are no circumpolar assessments of available habitat for larval krill, making it difficult to evaluate how climate change may impact this life stage. We use outputs from a circumpolar sea ice model, together with a set of simple assumptions regarding key habitat features, to identify possible regions of larval krill habitat around Antarctica during winter. We assume that the location and suitability of habitat is determined by both food availability and three-dimensional complexity of the sea ice. A comparison of the combined area of these regions under current conditions with a warm climate scenario indicates that while total areal sea ice extent decreases, there is a consistently larger area of potential larval krill habitat under warm conditions. These findings suggest that decreases in sea ice extent may not necessarily be detrimental for krill populations. ï¿½2016. American Geophysical Union. All Rights Reserved.",2-s2.0-84991494454

Our study assessed the condition of larval (furcilia VI) and one year old juvenile krill collected in East Antarctica (115°E–130°E and 64°S–66°S) from September to October 2012. Krill condition was assessed using morphometric, elemental and biochemical body composition, growth rates, oxygen uptake and lipid content and composition. Diet was assessed using fatty acid biomarkers analysed in the krill. The growth rate of larvae was 0.0038 mm day with an inter-moult period of 14 days. The average oxygen uptake of juvenile krill was 0.30±0.02 μl oxygen consumed per mg dry weight per hour. Although protein was not significantly different amongst the krill analysed, the lipid content of krill was highly variable ranging from 9% to 27% dry weight in juveniles and from 4% to 13% dry weight in larvae. Specific algal biomarkers, fatty acids ratios, levels of both long-chain (≥C20) monounsaturated fatty acids and bacterial fatty acids found in krill were indicative of the mixed nature of dietary sources and the opportunistic feeding capability of larval and juvenile krill at the end of winter. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd",2-s2.0-84961231066

During sampling, furcilia of Euphausia superba demonstrated dietary plasticity between years, herbivory when feeding on sea-ice biota, and with a more heterotrophic diet when feeding from both the sea ice and the water column. Carbon isotope signatures suggested that the pteropod Limacina helicina, small copepods Oithona spp., ostracods and amphipods relied heavily on sea-ice biota. Post larval E. superba and omnivorous krill Thysanoessa macrura consumed both water column and ice biota, but further investigations are needed to estimate the contribution from each source.

DMSP is a methylated substrate produced in large amounts annually by ice-associated microalgae, while DMS plays a significant role in carbon and sulphur cycling in the Southern Ocean. In the East Antarctic study area between 115–125°E and 64–66°S, ice and slush cores, brine, under-ice seawater and zooplankton (Antarctic krill) samples were collected at 6 ice stations. The pack-ice was characterised by high snow loading which initiated flooding events and triggered nutrient supply to the sea-ice surface, while variation in ice conditions influenced sea-ice permeability. This ranged from impermeable surface and middle sections of the sea ice, to completely permeable ice cores at some stations. Chlorophyll a maxima shifted from the sea-ice surface horizon at the first station to the sea ice bottom layer at the last station. Highest DMSP concentrations were detected in brine samples at the sea-ice surface, reflecting a mismatch with respect to the distribution of chlorophyll a. Our data suggest enhanced DMSP production by sea-ice surface algal communities and its release into brine during freezing and melting, which in turn is coupled to flooding events early in the season. A time-cycle of DMS production by DMSP degradation and DMS efflux is evident at the sea ice-snow interface when slush is formed during melt. Seawater under the ice contained only low concentrations of DMSP and DMS, even when brine drainage was evident and the sea ice became permeable. We postulate that in situ grazing by zooplankton may act as sink for the DMSP produced early in the season. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd",2-s2.0-84953807204

How krill utilize sea ice depends on several factors such as region and developmental stage. A comprehensive understanding of sea ice habitat use by krill, however, remains largely unknown. The aim of this study was to improve the understanding of the krill’s interaction with the sea ice habitat during winter/early spring by conducting large-scale sampling of the ice–water interface (0–2 m) and comparing the size and developmental stage composition of krill with the pelagic population (0–500 m). Results show that the population in the northern Weddell Sea consisted mainly of krill that were <1 year old (age class 0; AC0), and that it was comprised of multiple cohorts. Size per developmental stage differed spatially, indicating that the krill likely were advected from various origins. The size distribution of krill differed between the two depth strata sampled. Larval stages with a relatively small size (mean 7–8 mm) dominated the upper two metre layer of the water column, while larger larvae and AC0 juveniles (mean 14–15 mm) were proportionally more abundant in the 0- to 500-m stratum. Our results show that, as krill mature, their vertical distribution and utilization of the sea ice appear to change gradually. This could be the result of changes in physiology and/or behaviour, as, e.g., the krill’s energy demand and swimming capacity increase with size and age. The degree of sea ice association will have an effect on large-scale spatial distribution patterns of AC0 krill and on predictions of the consequences of sea ice decline on their survival over winter. © 2016, The Author(s).",2-s2.0-84953338948

Previous work has shown a general in-shore migration of krill in winter in this region; however, the very near-shore has not often been sampled as part of these surveys. We investigated distribution, abundance, and size structure of krill in 3 fjordic bays along the peninsula, and in the adjacent Gerlache Strait area using vertically stratified MOCNESS net tows and ADCP acoustic biomass estimates. Krill abundance was high within bays, with net estimated densities exceeding 60 krill m-3, while acoustic estimates were an order of magnitude higher. Krill within bays were larger than krill in the Gerlache Strait. Within bays, krill aggregations were observed near the seafloor during the day with aggregations extending to the sediment interface, and exhibited diel vertical migration higher into the water column at night. We suggest these high winter krill abundances within fjords are indicative of an active seasonal migration by krill in the peninsula region. Potential drivers for such a migration include reduced advective losses and costs, and availability of sediment food resources within fjords.

Laboratory evidence suggests that krill may shrink in body length during this time in response to the low availability of food. Nevertheless, verification that krill can shrink in the natural environment is lacking because winter data are difficult to obtain. One of the few sources of winter krill population data is from commercial vessels. We examined length-frequency data of adult krill (>35 mm total body length) obtained from commercial vessels in the Scotia-Weddell region and compared our results with those obtained from a combination of science and commercial sampling operations carried out in this region at other times of the year. Our analyses revealed body-length shrinkage in adult females but not males during winter, based on both the tracking of modal size classes over seasons and sex-ratio patterns. Other explanatory factors, such as differential mortality, immigration and emigration, could not explain the observed differences. The same pattern was also observed at South Georgia and in the Western Antarctic Peninsula. Fitted seasonally modulated von Bertalanffy growth functions predicted a pattern of overwintering shrinkage in all body-length classes of females, but only stagnation in growth in males. This shrinkage most likely reflects morphometric changes resulting from the contraction of the ovaries and is not necessarily an outcome of winter hardship.

Here, the extent to which three sympatric petrels (Antarctic and thin-billed prions, and blue petrel) from the subantarctic Kerguelen Islands modify their foraging ecology during molt was investigated using a combination of complementary tools, namely miniaturized saltwater immersion geolocators (GLS) and the isotopic method. Firstly, molting behavior was first characterized in the blue petrel, a reference species that is known to renew its plumage in autumn. GLS and feather stable isotopes (δ 13 C as a proxy of the birds' foraging habitat) indicated that the post-breeding molt of blue petrel occurred in Antarctic waters. Importantly, activity recorders showed that molt was marked by a strong peak in time spent daily sitting on water, which thereafter declined to lower values during the remaining winter months. Secondly, the peak in time spent sitting on water was used as a proxy to characterize the contrasted molt strategies of the two prion species. As blue petrels demonstrated, thin-billed prions molted during the post-breeding period in cold Antarctic waters where they fed primarily on low trophic level prey, most likely Antarctic krill (δ 15 N as a proxy of the birds' diet). By contrast, Antarctic prions presented an unexpected pre-breeding molt of longer duration that took place further north, in warm subtropical waters. Interestingly, the two Antarctic molting species, the blue petrel and thin-billed prion, renewed their plumage at the same time and within the same oceanic zone that is likely to be a previously undescribed hot spot of seabird diversity during the Austral autumn. The study contributes to a growing body of evidence that closely-related species exhibit various foraging strategies allowing ecological segregation and sheds new light on the poorly known critical molting stage of seabirds. © 2016 Cherel, Quillfeldt, Delord and Weimerskirch.",2-s2.0-84977843378

Experimental krill species were obtained from the Antarctic (South Georgia area), the Humboldt Current System (HCS, Chilean coast) and the Northern California Current System (NCCS, Oregon). Euphausia mucronata from the HCS showed oxyconforming pO2-dependent respiration below 80% air saturation (18 kPa). Normoxic subsurface oxygenation in winter posed a 'high oxygen stress' for this species. The NCCS krill, Euphausia pacifica, and the Antarctic krill, Euphausia superba, maintained respiration rates constant down to low critical pO2 values of 6 kPa (30% air saturation) and 11 kPa (55% air saturation), respectively. Antarctic krill had low antioxidant enzyme activities, but high concentrations of the molecular antioxidant glutathione (GSH) and was not lethally affected by 6 h exposure to moderate hypoxia. The temperate krill species (E. pacifica) had higher superoxide dismutase (SOD) values in winter than in summer, which relates to a higher winter metabolic rate. In all species, antioxidant enzyme activities remained constant during hypoxic exposure at the typical temperature for their habitat. Warming by 7 °C above habitat temperature in summer increased SOD activities and GSH levels in E. mucronata (HCS), but no oxidative damage occurred. In winter, when the NCCS is well mixed and the OMZ is deeper, +4 °C of warming combined with hypoxia represents a lethal condition for E. pacifica. In summer, when the OMZ expands upwards (100 m subsurface), antioxidant defences counteracted hypoxia and reoxygenation effects in E. pacifica, but only at mildly elevated temperature (+2 °C). In this season, experimental warming by +4 °C reduced antioxidant activities and the combination of warming with hypoxia again caused mortality of exposed specimens. We conclude that a climate change scenario combining warming and hypoxia represents a serious threat to E. pacifica and, as a consequence, NCCS food webs. © 2016 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.",2-s2.0-84958637451

Location: Scotia Sea and adjacent waters. Methods: The study focused on the winter period as this is the only time of the year when spatio-temporal overlaps between macaroni penguin foraging and the krill fishery can occur. We tracked adult macaroni penguins from a colony in South Georgia using global location sensors to determine winter distribution, and bioenergetics models to calculate the biomass of food consumed during the winter period. We combined these to produce a surface of the tonnes of krill consumed, which could be compared directly with the spatial distribution of the tonnes of krill caught by the fishery. Results: Adult macaroni penguins from South Georgia consumed 135,826 tonnes of krill (95% CIs: 83,446-188,140) during the winter, which is similar to the 98,431 tonnes caught by fisheries over the same period. However, macaroni penguins had a very wide pelagic distribution across the Scotia Sea, whereas the fishery was restricted to three small areas on shelf edges, such that their spatial overlap was negligible. The proportion of the estimated krill stock taken by macaroni penguins and the krill fishery was small at both the scale of the Scotia Sea and the local areas within which the fisheries operate. Main conclusions: Competition between macaroni penguins and the krill fishery is low under current management and far less than that among the various species of krill predators that occur in the Scotia Sea. Our method will allow quantification of changes in competition between macaroni penguins and krill fisheries should the latter expand in the future, and provides a framework for assessing predator-fishery competition in other systems.

Krill abundance fluctuates with oceanographic conditions, most notably variation in winter sea ice, and is susceptible to environmental change. Although links between local krill availability and performance of land breeding, central place foragers are recognised, the effects of krill variability on baleen whales remain largely unclear because concurrent long-term data on whale condition and krill abundance do not exist. Here, we quantify links between whale body condition and krill abundance using a simple model that links krill abundance to sea ice extent. Body condition of humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) caught in west Australian waters between 1947 and 1963 was estimated from oil yields in whaling records. Annual estimates of krill abundance in the Southern Ocean where those whales foraged (70°–130°E) were correlated significantly with contemporary annual winter sea ice extent. We hindcast sea ice extent for the whaling period from reconstructed temperature data and found that whale body condition was significantly correlated with hindcasted winter sea ice extent, supporting the hypothesis that variations in body condition were likely mediated by associated krill fluctuations. As humpback whales migrate and breed on finite energy stores accrued during summer foraging in the Antarctic, changes in sea ice and concomitant changes in krill abundance have long-term implications for their condition and reproductive success. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",2-s2.0-84937972722

It is not exactly known whether the scarcity of food or an internal clock, set by the natural Antarctic light regime, are responsible for non-feeding. Our research questions were therefore the following: (1) How will physiological and biochemical conditions of krill change during long-term starvation at constant light regime? (2) If and how do enzyme activities change during such starvation? (3) What is the influence of food availability versus that of light regime? To answer these questions, adult krill were starved under laboratory conditions for 12 weeks with constant light regime (12:12; dark/light) and the impact on physiological functions was studied. Initial experimental condition of krill resembled the condition of late spring krill in the field with fully active metabolism and low lipid reserves. Metabolic activity and activities of enzymes catabolising lipids decreased after the onset of starvation and remained low throughout, whereas lipid reserves declined and lipid composition changed. Mass and size of krill decreased while the inter-moult period increased. Depletion of storage- and structural metabolites occurred in the order of depot lipids and glycogen reserves after onset of starvation until proteins were almost exclusively used after 6–7 weeks of starvation. Results confirmed various proposed overwintering mechanisms such as metabolic slowdown, slow growth or shrinkage and use of lipid reserves. However, these changes were set in motion by food shortage only, i.e. without the trigger of a changing light regime. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",2-s2.0-84929946201

Food sources are particularly scarce during winter. Herbivorous krill, such as the arcto-boreal Thysanoessa inermis, are key components in the ecosystem of Kongsfjord and strongly rely on phytoplankton as a food source. During the polar night such species must therefore be adapted to survive long periods without significant nutritional input. We investigated physiological mechanisms and the allocation of energy resources to try to explain how T. inermis manages to survive the Arctic winter. Adult specimens caught in late summer were kept under starvation conditions for 28 d. Changes in metabolic rates (respiration and excretion) and biochemical composition (protein, lipid and fatty acid analyses) were monitored. In contrast to the Antarctic krill Euphausia superba and the subtropical E. hanseni, the arcto-boreal species did not reduce metabolism but utilized lipid reserves for survival. Assessed from total lipid stores and energy demand, the potential survival period was estimated at 63 d without food uptake, which is not sufficient to survive the entire winter. Results were compared to specimens that overwintered in situ and were discussed in relation to other euphausiids. In conclusion, T. inermis is well adapted to survive the Arctic winter provided that alternative food sources are available, but has a different strategy to cope with starvation than krill species from other latitudes. © The authors 2015.",2-s2.0-84924904578

Principal component analysis of 60 fatty acids showed that 3 principal components (PCs) explained approximately 50% of the variability in fatty acid profiles. The first PC separated the fatty acid indicators along a herbivory-omnivory-carnivory gradient.

The interannual variability in the abundance and biomass of krill was examined using a 17-year time-series of acoustic observations undertaken in the Western Core Box (WCB) survey area to the northwest of South Georgia, Southern Ocean. Krill targets were identified in acoustic data using a multifrequency identification window and converted to krill density using the Stochastic Distorted-Wave Born Approximation target strength model. Krill density ranged over several orders of magnitude (0-10 000 g m-2) and its distribution was highly skewed with many zero observations. Within each survey, the mean krill density was significantly correlated with the top 7% of the maximum krill densities observed. Hence, only the densest krill swarms detected in any one year drove the mean krill density estimates for the WCB in that year. WCB krill density (μ, mean density for the area) showed several years (1997/1998, 2001-2003, 2005-2007) of high values (μ &gt; 30 g m-2) interspersed with years (1999/2000, 2004, 2009/2010) of low density (μ &lt; 30 g m-2).

Cross correlation analyses of variability in krill density with current and lagged indices of ocean (sea surface temperature, SST and El Niño/Southern Oscillation) and atmospheric variability (Southern Annular Mode) found the highest correlation between krill density and winter SST (August SST) from the preceding year.

Altogether, 132 species were identified. Species composition changed with depth from a euphausiid-dominated community in the surface layer, via a siphonophore-dominated community in the epipelagic layer, to a chaetognath-dominated community in the deep layer. The surface layer community predominantly changed along gradients of surface water temperature and sea ice parameters, whereas the epipelagic community mainly changed along hydrographical gradients. Although representing only 1% of the depth range of the epipelagic layer, mean per-area macrofauna densities in the surface layer ranged at 8% of corresponding epipelagic densities in summer, 6% in autumn, and 24% in winter. Seasonal shifts of these proportional densities in abundant species indicated different strategies in the use of the surface layer, including both hibernal downward and hibernal upward shift in the vertical distribution, as well as year-round surface layer use by Antarctic krill. These findings imply that the surface layer, especially when it is ice-covered, is an important functional node of the pelagic ecosystem that has been underestimated by conventional depth-integrated sampling in the past.

Across 92 stations, representing a year-round average, the food volume in krill stomachs comprised 71 ± 29% algae, 17 ± 21% protozoans, and 12 ± 25% metazoans. Fatty acid trophic markers showed that copepods were consistently part of krill diet, not a switch food. In open waters, both diatom and copepod consumption increased with phytoplankton abundance. Under sea ice, ingestion of diatoms became rare, whereas feeding on copepods remained constant. During winter, larvae contained high but variable proportions of diatom markers, whereas in postlarvae the role of copepods increased with krill body length. Overwintering differed according to habitat. Krill from South Georgia had lower lipid stores than those from the Bransfield Strait or Lazarev Sea. Feeding effort was much reduced in Lazarev Sea krill, whereas most individuals from the Bransfield Strait and South Georgia contained phytoplankton and seabed detritus in their stomachs. Their retention of essential body reserves indicates that krill experienced most winter hardship in the Lazarev Sea, followed by South Georgia and then Bransfield Strait. This was reflected in the delayed development from juveniles to adults in the Lazarev Sea. Circumpolar comparisons of length frequencies suggest that krill growth conditions are more favorable in the southwest Atlantic than in the Lazarev Sea or off East Antarctica because of longer phytoplankton bloom periods and rewarding access to benthic food. © 2014, by the Association for the Sciences of Limnology and Oceanography, Inc.",2-s2.0-84892762721

However, our understanding of the processes governing variability in the supply of these food resources is limited by the poor spatial and temporal resolution of available data. Here, we use a numerical modeling approach to examine the underlying physical processes driving the recruitment and retention of zooplankton to the South Georgia shelf. Variability in the magnitude and spatial distribution of recruitment was dominated by the proximity and orientation of the southern Antarctic Circumpolar Current front to the shelf edge. Shelf retention was highest for source sites on the southwest shelf, with the main transport routes off the shelf to the north and northwest. Retention was lowest in the austral summer and winter; in summer increased glacial melt drives stronger off-shelf near-surface currents, while in winter, stronger winds lead to an increase in off-shelf transport. Of particular note was the prediction of a significant increase in retention for particles released throughout the shelf in April and July 2000. This period coincided with the development of pronounced anticlockwise shelf flows, associated with horizontal density gradients due to reduced wind mixing of shelf waters, and differences between shelf and oceanic waters, which significantly reduced off-shelf transport rates.

Variability in energetic demands during phases of the breeding period has the capacity to shape foraging behaviour and influence at-sea foraging behaviour of seabirds due to the changing requirements of the young. Short-tailed shearwaters (Puffinus tenuirostris) (STSH) are a migratory species that migrates between foraging grounds in the northern Pacific Ocean and breeding colonies in south-east Australia. They are known to traverse large sectors of the Southern Ocean to find prey; however the at-sea foraging locations of this species are not spatially and temporally well defined during the breeding season, when energetic requirements are at their peak. We aimed to define key foraging areas of STSH over the pre-laying, incubation and chick-rearing phases of the breeding cycle and identify associations with broad scale oceanographic features. Using light-level geolocation archival tag technology, 27 adults from a southern Tasmanian colony were tracked from their arrival in October to March (2010-2011), providing information on a total of 77 pre-laying exodus, incubation and chick-rearing flights throughout the Southern Ocean. During the pre-laying exodus and incubation phases, the birds visited waters of the sub-Antarctic Front and Polar Frontal Zone. After hatching, the birds made direct flights to the Marginal Ice Zone between 155°E and 90°E. The Antarctic pack ice is a key nursery ground for Antarctic krill (Euphasia superba) over the winter months, and as the ice retreats they become more accessible to STSH when energetic demands, due to chick provisioning, are at their greatest. During late chick-rearing, the birds used waters in the region of the Antarctic Divergence. A foraging index created from activity data collected by the tags indicated that adults spent the greatest amount of time foraging at the furthest extent of each trip. This study has shown that STSH alter their foraging movements over the course of the breeding season, using areas that are likely to provide predictable food resources. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.",2-s2.0-84889598465

The transport and fate of the embryo and larva under present and modified conditions was investigated with Lagrangian particle tracking simulations. The two modeling studies were implemented using temperature and density (embryo-larva model) and circulation distributions (Lagrangian particle tracking) obtained from a high resolution version of the Regional Ocean Modeling System configured for the wAP shelf region. Additional simulations used temperature and circulation distributions obtained from simulations that were forced with increased wind speed and increased transport of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC), both projected to possibly occur with climate change in the wAP region. Simulations using present conditions showed that successful completion of the descent-ascent cycle occurred along the outer shelf and on the shelf in regions with bottom depths of 600-700. m. Estimated residence times for the shelf regions that support success of the embryo and larva were 20-30 days. Thus, krill spawned in the mid and inner shelf regions can be retained in these regions through development to the first feeding stage (calyptopis 1). Increased winds and ACC transport resulted in more onshelf transport of Circumpolar Deep Water (CDW), which increased the volume of warm (1-1.5. °C) water at depth. These conditions supported a moderate increase in success of the krill embryo and larva, but only for limited areas of the shelf where hatching depths decreased by 10-30. m (<5%) and development time to the calyptopis 1 stage decreased by 15-20%. The modified circulation conditions also supported increased advection of krill larvae into areas of the shelf that would experience the largest reduction of sea ice, especially in winter. Projected changes in wind strength and CDW transport may potentially enhance larval survival and advection onto the wAP shelf, but recruitment may be decreased by modifications to local sea ice distributions that would impede survival of Antarctic krill that overwinter on the shelf. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",2-s2.0-84883197741

Most organisms' life cycles in this region are attuned to ice seasonality. The annual retreat and melting of sea ice in the austral spring stratifies the upper ocean, triggering large phytoplankton blooms. The magnitude of the blooms is proportional to the winter extent of ice cover, which can act as a barrier to wind mixing. Antarctic krill, one of the most abundant metazoan populations on Earth, consume phytoplankton blooms dominated by large diatoms. Krill, in turn, support a large biomass of predators, including penguins, seals, and whales. Human activity has altered even these remote ecosystems. The western Antarctic Peninsula region has warmed by 7°C over the past 50 years, and sea ice duration has declined by almost 100 days since 1978, causing a decrease in phytoplankton productivity in the northern peninsula region. Besides climate change, Antarctic marine systems have been greatly altered by harvesting of the great whales and now krill.

A key species of the Southern Ocean ecosystem, the Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) has evolved rhythmic physiological and behavioral mechanisms to adapt to daily and seasonal changes. The molecular organization of the clockwork underlying these biological rhythms is, nevertheless, still only partially understood.Methodology/Principal Findings:The genome sequence of the Antarctic krill is not yet available. A normalized cDNA library was produced and pyrosequenced in the attempt to identify large numbers of transcripts. All available E. superba sequences were then assembled to create the most complete existing oligonucleotide microarray platform with a total of 32,217 probes. Gene expression signatures of specimens collected in the Ross Sea at five different time points over a 24-hour cycle were defined, and 1,308 genes differentially expressed were identified. Of the corresponding transcripts, 609 showed a significant sinusoidal expression pattern; about 40% of these exibithed a 24-hour periodicity while the other 60% was characterized by a shorter (about 12-hour) rhythm. We assigned the differentially expressed genes to functional categories and noticed that those concerning translation, proteolysis, energy and metabolic process, redox regulation, visual transduction and stress response, which are most likely related to daily environmental changes, were significantly enriched. Two transcripts of peroxiredoxin, thought to represent the ancestral timekeeping system that evolved about 2.5 billion years ago, were also identified as were two isoforms of the EsRh1 opsin and two novel arrestin1 sequences involved in the visual transduction cascade.Conclusions:Our work represents the first characterization of the krill diurnal transcriptome under natural conditions and provides a first insight into the genetic regulation of physiological changes, which occur around the clock during an Antarctic summer day. © 2013 De Pittà et al.",2-s2.0-84880429841

Using the data obtained during 14 shipboard surveys sampled on a fixed grid (150 K km2) during mid- to late summer, I quantified the spatial distribution and intra-seasonal variability of fur seal sightings relative to distance to land and hydrographic boundaries. I test the hypothesis that fur seals display an increase in their at-sea abundance during mid- to late summer near the Antarctic Peninsula as they prepare to take up wintering grounds. I also test whether abundances of their potential prey, krill and myctophids, exhibit intra-seasonal variability. During midsummer, high-abundance areas are located near major breeding colonies; however, during late summer, there is an order-of-magnitude increase in fur seal abundance, coinciding with an increase in the number of high-abundance areas located in Bransfield Strait. Coincidently, abundance of Euphausia superba decreased and the myctophid Electrona antarctica increased between mid- and late-summer surveys. High-abundance areas of fur seals are not associated with the southern Antarctic Circumpolar Current front but are concentrated within 100 km from land, potentially indicating the location of haul out and important coastal habitat use areas. The dynamic increase in the number and location of high-abundance areas during late summer represents a considerable amount of mammalian predators entering the Antarctic Peninsula marine ecosystem.

They therefore provide a useful basis for developing comparative analyses of ocean ecosystems around the Antarctic. There are clear and expected differences in seasonality and species composition between the two ecosystems, but these mask an underlying similarity in ecosystem structure and function. This similarity results from the two ecosystems being part of a continuum, from more ice covered regions in the south to open water regions in the north. Within this continuum the major factors affecting ecosystem structure and function are the sea ice, the biogeochemical conditions and the connectivity generated by the flow of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current. Antarctic krill are central to the food web in both ecosystems, but the other species of plankton and predators present are different. These different species provide alternative pathways of energy transfer from primary production to the highest trophic levels. The relative dominance of these species can provide indicators of change in ecosystem structure and function. Both ecosystems are changing as a result of physically and biologically driven processes, and the ecological responses being observed are complex and variable across different species and within the two regions. Species in parts of the northern Antarctic Peninsula are being replaced by species that currently dominate farther north in more oceanic areas such as at South Georgia. The similarity of structure and strong connectivity, mean that projections of future change will require generic models of these ecosystems that can encompass changes in structure and function within a connected continuum from ice covered to open water in winter. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.",2-s2.0-84869865574

How krill adapt to these conditions has yet to be determined, and it was the purpose of this study to gain more insight by investigating the differences between summer and winter krill populations at the molecular level. To achieve this, we used a cDNA microarray to compare gene expression between female adult krill caught during summer and winter near the Antarctic Peninsula (60° S), and between Peninsula krill and krill caught near South Georgia (54° S) during the same winter. The Peninsula seasonal comparison showed up-regulation in summer krill of genes involved in feeding and digestion, respiration, motor activity and immunity. Summer krill also showed evidence of increased vitellogenesis, with an insulin-related peptide up-regulated and neuroparsin down-regulated. The comparison between the different overwintering locations showed an up-regulation in the South Georgia krill of genes involved in feeding and digestion, and immunity. There was, however, no differential expression of genes involved in respiration, motor activity or vitellogenesis, suggesting that despite the above differences, both populations of overwintering krill were in a quiescent state.

The core data set consists of four RMT-net-sampling surveys that were conducted in early summer (December 2005 and 2007), autumn (April 2004) and winter (July to August 2006). Supplementary data were analysed from the 1980s to view the results in a wider geographical context. The major observations are the following: (1) krill abundance and distribution showed geographical, seasonal and interannual fluctuations. Krill abundance was almost one order of magnitude lower compared to the Southwest Atlantic. (2) Krill density showed substantial differences between day and night for autumn and winter surveys. (3) A spatial gradient was observed for krill size groups, with larger sized (adult spawning) krill further south and medium-sized juveniles and immatures mainly between 60° and 67°S. (4) Data on maturity stage composition and larvae occurrence indicate an active and successful spawning in these high-latitude areas even under the conditions of sea-ice cover. At the end of the spawning season, females and males regressed in their external sexual characteristics ('re-juvenation') to overwintering immature stages. Major conclusions relate to a conceptual view of the spatial distribution of krill size classes and the occurrence of larvae in the context of major oceanographic features and current systems in the Lazarev Sea and adjacent ocean sectors. The Lazarev Sea obviously does not support a single self-maintaining population, but represents a complex transition zone of stocks with different origins from the Scotia Sea and the Cosmonaut Sea. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.",2-s2.0-84864356636

During recent years, harvesting of krill has in - creased, possibly enhancing stress on krill and Antarctic ecosystems. Here we review the overall impact of climate change on krill and Antarctic ecosystems, discuss implications for an ecosystem-based fisheries management approach and identify critical knowledge gaps. Sea ice decline, ocean warming and other environmental stressors act in concert to modify the abundance, distribution and life cycle of krill. Although some of these changes can have positive effects on krill, their cumulative impact is most likely negative. Recruitment, driven largely by the winter survival of larval krill, is probably the population parameter most susceptible to climate change. Predicting changes to krill populations is urgent, because they will seriously impact Antarctic eco - systems. Such predictions, however, are complicated by an intense inter-annual variability in recruitment success and krill abundance. To improve the responsiveness of the ecosystem-based management ap - proach adopted by the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR), critical knowledge gaps need to be filled. In addition to a better understanding of the factors influencing recruitment, management will require a better un - derstanding of the resilience and the genetic plasticity of krill life stages, and a quantitative understanding of under-ice and benthic habitat use. Current precautionary management measures of CCAMLR should be maintained until a better understanding of these processes has been achieved. © Inter-Research 2012.",2-s2.0-84863563644

We identified a positive significant effect of seal mass on δ13C values, as well as a significant seasonal effect (higher δ13C values in austral winter), which likely resulted from changes in the composition of the community of primary producers. δ15N values for crabeater seals, on the other hand, were affected by year, with individuals in 2002 having higher δ15N values.

A vesselmounted acoustic Doppler current profiler (ADCP) and a calibrated EK-60 echo sounder were used to assess circulation patterns and krill distributions in the bay, and a multiple opening and closing net (with 333 μm mesh) and environmental sensing system (MOCNESS) was used to collect live samples of mesozooplankton and krill for taxonomic composition analysis.

This super-aggregation of krill covered ̃100 km 2, had a concentration of 1000s of individuals m -2 and was associated with more than 306 humpback whales present in Wilhelmina Bay. Our results from the mesozooplankton study revealed that krill continuously conducted diel vertical migrations and formed aggregations in the inner bay, while the chlorophyll concentration at the surface decreased from 2.2 to 0.6 g C m -2 due to the decrease of daylight, and zooplankton concentrations increased from 0.5 to 1.5 g C m -2 probably from advective influx. Most zooplankton were distributed below 200 m while krill fed in the upper 150 m. The spatial and temporal correlations between krill and small- to medium-sized mesozooplankton imply that krill may become omnivorous when there is a lack of phytoplankton in the late austral fall. Though both phytoplankton and zooplankton biomasses contributed only small fractions of the daily ration needed for krill metabolism in Wilhelmina Bay, it is not clear what caused krill to aggregate on such a large scale, as this led to high mortality as a result of starvation and predation by whales and other top predators. © Inter-Research 2012.",2-s2.0-84860253970

Field and experimental observations from Southern Ocean Global Ocean Ecosystems Dynamics cruises in 2001 and 2002 and the Palmer Long-Term Ecological Research program were used to parameterize the model. Growth was modeled by partitioning total body carbon between length and condition factor. Total body carbon was simulated with empirical temperature- dependent rates of ingestion of phytoplankton and respiration, and ingestion of algae grown on a surface to simulate sea ice algae. Light-driven diel vertical migration modulated ingestion of phytoplankton and sea ice algae as a function of latitude, season and sea ice cover. Simulations highlighted 3 environmental processes that controlled food availability, and consequently, physiological condition of krill: the fall phytoplankton decline, sea ice advance and development of sea ice microbial communities, and the late winter increase in sea ice microbial community biomass. Fall phytoplankton dynamics were identified as a major driver of the physiological condition of larval krill throughout this critical period.

Data were obtained using novel Surface and Under Ice Trawls (SUIT), which sampled the 0-2 m surface layer both under sea ice and in open water. Average surface layer densities ranged between 0.8 individuals m -2 in summer and autumn, and 2.7 individuals m -2 in winter. In summer, under-ice densities of Antarctic krill were significantly higher than in open waters. In autumn, the opposite pattern was observed. Under winter sea ice, densities were often low, but repeatedly far exceeded summer and autumn maxima. Statistical models showed that during summer high densities of Antarctic krill in the 0-2 m layer were associated with high ice coverage and shallow mixed layer depths, among other factors. In autumn and winter, density was related to hydrographical parameters. Average under-ice densities from the 0-2 m layer were higher than corresponding values from the 0-200 m layer collected with Rectangular Midwater Trawls (RMT) in summer. In winter, under-ice densities far surpassed maximum 0-200 m densities on several occasions. This indicates that the importance of the ice-water interface layer may be under-estimated by the pelagic nets and sonars commonly used to estimate the population size of Antarctic krill for management purposes, due to their limited ability to sample this habitat. Our results provide evidence for an almost year-round association of Antarctic krill with the under-ice habitat, hundreds of kilometres into the ice-covered area of the Lazarev Sea. Local concentrations of postlarval Antarctic krill under winter sea ice suggest that sea ice biota are important for their winter survival. These findings emphasise the susceptibility of an ecological key species to changing sea ice habitats, suggesting potential ramifications on Antarctic ecosystems induced by climate change. © 2012 Flores et al.",2-s2.0-84857517510

However, direct observations during spring are rare. Here we studied krill body condition and maturity stage in relation to feeding (i.e. stomach fullness, diet, absorption of individual fatty acids and defecation rate) across the Scotia Sea in November 2006. The phytoplankton concentrations were low at the marginal ice zone (MIZ) in the southern Scotia Sea (Stn. 1, 2, and 3), high in open waters of the Southern Antarctic Circumpolar Current Front (SACCF) in the central Scotia Sea (Stn. 5), and moderate further north (Stn. 6 and 7). Krill had low lipid reserves (~6.5% of dry mass, DM), low mass:length ratios (~1.7mgDMmm -1), and small digestive glands (~7% of total DM) near the ice edge. The stomachs contained lithogenic particles, diatom debris, and bacterial fatty acids, but low proportions of diatom-indicating fatty acids, which suggest that these krill were feeding on detritus rather than on fresh ice algae. In the SACCF, krill had higher lipid reserves (~10% of DM), high mass:length ratios (~2.2mgDMmm -1), and large digestive glands (~16% of total DM). Stomach content and tissue composition indicate feeding on diatoms. In the north, moderate food concentrations co-occurred with low lipid reserves in krill, and moderate mass:length ratios and digestive gland sizes. Only in the phytoplankton bloom in the SACCF had the mating season already started and some females were about to spawn. Based on the way krill processed their food at the different stations, we indicate two mechanisms that can lead to fast regeneration of body reserves and oocyte maturation in E. superba. One is ""superfluous"" feeding at high food concentrations, which maximises the overall nutrient gain. The other is a preferential absorption of crucial fatty acids: 20:5(n-3) and 22:6(n-3) when regaining body condition after the winter, and 14:0 and 16:1(n-7) during accumulation of oocyte yolk. Multi-year time series of phytoplankton distribution show that an early spring bloom, as found in 2006, is not unusual for the central Scotia Sea and coincides with high krill larval concentrations in this area. In conclusion, the Scotia Sea is a main spawning ground of Antarctic krill and this is linked to phytoplankton blooms in open waters of the SACCF rather than to ice edge blooms. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.",2-s2.0-84855947024

The study involved the weekly sampling of the population and its potential food with a Rectangular Midwater Trawl (RMT1) at weekly intervals between May 2005 and October 2006. Offshore samples were taken the previous austral summer using an RMT8 net. T. gaudichaudii produced one main cohort in the spring (September/October) and a secondary weaker cohort in the late summer (January/February). The main cohort appeared at the time of phytoplankton increase, about 3 weeks before an increase in mesozooplankton. Larger individuals (20-25mm) resided offshore but not within the Bay during the main recruitment period. T. gaudichaudii grew at an average rate of 0.1mmd -1 during the first four months after release and then by 0.07mmd -1 for the subsequent four months. At these rates, it is possible that the main cohort reaches reproductive size in time to spawn the autumn cohort, although the relative weakness of the autumn cohort suggests that few manage this. T. gaudichaudii biomass reached its highest levels in November at a mean value of 5.4mgDWm -3 while daily production was also highest in November at a mean value of 0.17mgDWm -3d -1. The P/Bd -1 ratio varied between 0.03d -1 in the summer to below 0.01d -1 in the winter. Daily mortality rate was initially 0.12d -1 during the first two months post-recruitment, falling to 0.03d -1 for the remainder of the year. Integrating production over the year gave a value of 10.04mgDWy -1, equivalent to 3.62mgCm -3y -1, making T. gaudichaudii a relatively productive component of the pelagic community. During the summer, the species was estimated to consume around 1-2% of available mesozooplankton biomass and a mean of 15% of mesozooplankton daily productivity. T. gaudichaudii may have a controlling influence on mesozooplankton dynamics as well as on the recruitment of the larval stages of important commercially fished species such as Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) and Mackerel icefish (Champsocephalus gunnari). © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.",2-s2.0-84855943469

A second aim is to clarify the extent to which seasonal variation in larval and adult krill physiology is mediated by environmental factors with a strong seasonality, such as food supply or day light. Experimental studies on adult krill have demonstrated that specific physiological adaptations during autumn and winter, such as reduced metabolic rates and feeding activity, are not caused simply by the scarcity of food, as was previously assumed. These adaptations appear to be influenced by the local light regime. The physiological functions that larval krill adopt during winter (reduced metabolism, delayed development, lipid utilisation, and variable growth rates) are, in contrast to the adults, under direct control by the available food supply. During winter, the adults often seem to have little association with sea ice (at least until early spring). The larvae, however, feed within sea ice but mainly on the grazers of the ice algal community rather than on the algae themselves. In this respect, a miss-match in timing of the occurrence of the last phytoplankton blooms in autumn and the start of the sea ice formation, as has been increasingly observed in the west Antarctic Peninsula (WAP) region, will impact larval krill development during winter in terms of food supply and consequently the krill stock in this region. © 2011 The Author(s).",2-s2.0-82255191953

We affixed archival temperature tags to gentoo penguins (Pygoscelis papua) from two colonies in the South Shetland Islands to measure the frequency, timing, and duration of foraging trips and to estimate minimum food requirements during winter. Foraging trip frequencies ranged from 0.85 to 1.0 trips day-1 and were positively correlated with day length. Early winter foraging trips more closely matched day length than late winter foraging trips. The data suggest that individuals maximize foraging time during the early winter period, likely to recover body mass following the breeding season and molt. The more attenuated response of foraging trip durations to increasing day length in late winter may be related to differences in local resource availability or individual behaviors prior to the upcoming breeding season. Minimum food requirements also exhibited a seasonal cycle with a mid-winter minimum. On average, minimum food requirements were estimated at 0.70 ± 0.12 kg day-1.

In total, 57 quantitative hauls were conducted in the Lazarev Sea (Southern Ocean) during 3 different seasons (autumn 2004, winter 2006, summer 2007/2008). At least 46 species from eight phyla were caught in all 3 seasons combined. Biomass density was dominated by Antarctic krill Euphausia superba. The average biomass density was highest under the winter sea ice and lowest under the young ice in autumn. In summer, macrozooplankton biomass was dominated by ctenophores in open water and by Antarctic krill under ice. The community composition varied significantly among seasons, and according to the presence of sea ice. The response of the community composition to the presence of sea ice was influenced by species that were significantly more abundant in open water than under ice (Cyllopus lucasii, Hyperiella dilatata), only seasonally abundant under ice (Clione antarctica), or significantly associated with sea ice (Eusirus laticarpus). A number of abundant species showed distinct diel patterns in the surface occurrence both under ice and in open water, indicating that the surface layer serves as a foraging ground predominantly at night. Our results emphasize the potential of a number of non-euphausiid macrozooplankton and micronekton species to act as energy transmitters between the production of sea ice biota and the pelagic food web.

Euphausiids were collected from six discrete depth layers, primarily between 0 and 2000 m, using an RMT 8 net. Euphausia frigida and Euphausia triacantha mainly occurred north of the Southern Boundary of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (SB) whereas E. superba was distributed south of the SB, and occurred abundantly in the continental slope area where Antarctic Winter Water was observed. E. frigida and E. triacantha occurred in the upper 200 m during the night whereas they were mainly found below 200 m during the daytime. Cluster analysis on stations suggested that the SB is an important biological boundary for euphausiid communities. The population structure of E. superba in 2003 was different from that of 2005 and 2008. While large mature individuals dominated in 2003, small immature krill (juveniles and subadult males) were more abundant in 2005 and 2008. Further sea-ice extension in the preceding winter in 2005 and 2008 likely provided favourable conditions for spawning and survival. A cluster analysis based on similarity of the maturity stages of E. superba revealed that mature males and gravid females (stage IIIC-E) were mainly distributed in the offshore area and mesopelagic zone, while juveniles and subadult males were found in the epipelagic zone of the continental slope area.

Crustaceans dominated the system in both seasons, accounting for 32 of the 55 species captured in the fall and 30 of the 48 species captured in winter. In both seasons, a very few species made up the majority of the catch. In the fall, the euphausiids Euphausia crystallorophias, Euphausia superba, and Thysanoessa macrura, and the mysid Antarctomysis ohlinii numerically dominated the assemblage, contributing over 85% of the total. In the winter, the same three euphausiids and the chaetognath Pseudosagitta gazellae were the numerical dominants, comprising over 90% of the catch. A significant increase in total abundance and biomass was observed from 2001 to 2002. The invertebrate micronekton/macrozooplankton communities found in the Marguerite Bay region of the WAP were a mixture of oceanic and neritic fauna: a direct result of local hydrographic conditions. Near the shelf break and in the outer reaches of the Marguerite Trough, a deep canyon transecting the shelf in a south-southeast direction, the communities were more diverse, dominated by oceanic species such as Euphausia triacantha, Salpa thompsoni, and Themisto gaudichaudi. The assemblages present in the nearshore fjords exhibited lower diversity and were dominated by neritic species such as E. crystallorophias and A. ohlinii. At the mid-shelf and mid-trough locations, the assemblages were composed of a variable mixture of oceanic and neritic fauna. The faunal mixing and overall species composition in those areas is the result of episodic Circumpolar Deep Water (CDW) intrusions onto the shelf via deep bathymetric features such as the Marguerite Trough. Species diversity and integrated abundance for the upper 200. m of the water column were similar between seasons in the WAP study region, but integrated biomass was nearly three times greater in fall than in winter. Integrated estimates from the WAP study region were similar to those from other studies conducted in the Scotia and Weddell Seas, but were orders of magnitude lower than estimates from a study in Croker Passage, primarily due to a large catch of E. superba.

Total macrozooplankton biomass, however, increased significantly from summer (0.88 and 0.97g dry weight 1000m-3 in Summer 05/06 and Summer 07/08, respectively) to Autumn 04 (2.66g dry weight 1000m-3) and Winter 06 levels (1.75g dry weight 1000m-3). This biomass increase was due to both an increased occurrence of Euphausia superba and fish and a shift to a larger size structure in the latter group.

However, a strong and distinctive change in assemblage structure was observed between seasons. Key amongst these was a shift within the euphausiids from a dominance of T. macrura in summer to that of E. superba in autumn and winter; a winter decrease in E. hamata; an autumn and winter decrease in Tomopteris sp.; and a winter increase in the abundance of the grazers Clio pyramidata sulcata and Ihlea racovitzai, hyperiids, and the myctophid fish Electrona antarctica. Carnivorous macrozooplankton formed the major trophic group in all seasons, contributing 44-60% to total macrozooplankton abundance and 39-58% to total macrozooplankton biomass in all four surveys. The combined predation pressure of carnivores and potential increased winter carnivory by E. superba and other omnivorous species, was expected to be high. In view of low winter primary production, we suggest that the epipelagic food web of the Lazarev Sea shifted from being bottom-up controlled in summer to top-down controlled in winter. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.",2-s2.0-79957988169

A MOCNESS net system was used to sample the vertical distribution and abundance of zooplankton relative to physical features (hydrography and circulation) during four broad-scale survey cruises in the fall and winter of 2001 and 2002. Four species were found throughout the study area on all four cruises: Euphausia superba, Euphausia crystallorophias, Euphausia triacantha, and Thysanoessa macrura. The species had significantly different horizontal and vertical distributions. Both E. superba and T. macrura were broadly distributed throughout the area, but the central 50% of their vertical distributions were distinct with E. superba most abundant in the upper 100. m in the coldest, freshest water (average temperature and salinity: -1.13 °C; 33.80) and T. macrura occurring between 100 and 250. m (at 0.01 °C; 34.228). E. crystallorophias had a more coastal distribution and was usually found deeper in slightly warmer and saltier water (-0.44 °C; 33.9982) than E. superba and either overlapped or was above T. macrura in depth. E. triacantha was much rarer and sporadically distributed in the study area and was found substantially deeper (center of distribution about 300. m) in the warmest saltiest water (1.40 °C; 34.65) than the other three euphausiid species. Larval distributions for E. superba indicated that at least some proportion of the populations resulted from reproduction and development on the continental shelf, and not solely from offshore reproduction and transport onto the shelf. A neutral particle tracking model was used to gain insight into the relative importance of shelf versus off-shelf origins for the larvae. The results suggest that a combination of offshore and onshore reproduction can account for the observed E. superba larval distributions in the U.S. SO GLOBEC study site. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.",2-s2.0-79955970036

This region is also among the fastestwarming areas on the planet, with 5-6 °C increases in mean winter air temperatures and associated decreases in winter sea-ice cover. These biological and physical perturbations have affected the ecosystem profoundly. One hypothesis guiding ecological interpretations of changes in top predator populations in this region, the ""sea-ice hypothesis,"" proposes that reductions in winter sea ice have led directly to declines in ""ice-loving"" species by decreasing their winter habitat, while populations of ""ice-avoiding"" species have increased. However, 30 y of field studies and recent surveys of penguins throughout the WAP and Scotia Sea demonstrate this mechanism is not controlling penguin populations; populations of both ice-loving Adélie and ice-avoiding chinstrap penguins have declined significantly. We argue in favor of an alternative, more robust hypothesis that attributes both increases and decreases in penguin populations to changes in the abundance of their main prey, Antarctic krill. Unlike many other predators in this region, Adélie and chinstrap penguins were never directly harvested by man; thus, their population trajectories track the impacts of biological and environmental changes in this ecosystem. Linking trends in penguin abundance with trends in krill biomass explains why populations of Adélie and chinstrap penguins increased after competitors (fur seals, baleen whales, and some fishes) were nearly extirpated in the 19th to mid-20th centuries and currently are decreasing in response to climate change.",2-s2.0-79956298592

Krill were found to be in good condition, with mean growth rate of 0.95% per moult for postlarvae and 14.79% for larvae, and mean lipid content of 24.1% for postlarvae and 6.6% for larvae. Fatty acid profiles and stomach content analysis revealed two main feeding strategies - krill below the ice were feeding mostly on sea-ice diatoms, while those in open water were ingesting copepods and detritus. Krill below the ice had larger digestive glands than those in open water. Furciliae fatty acid profiles indicated a diet of heterotrophic flagellates and/or detritus. Postlarval krill survived 207 days of food deprivation by using body protein and lipid reserves for energy. In contrast, krill furciliae were severely depleted after just 5 days of food deprivation, indicating that they must feed continually at this time of year. Krill, copepods and sea-ice biota were all low in polyunsaturated fatty acids, indicating that krill must rely on later spring phytoplankton blooms to obtain these essential nutrients required for reproduction. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.",2-s2.0-79954631978

To gain a better understanding of this fundamental process in the Antarctic winter sea ice, we produced a model that estimates the time-integrated exposure of seasonal Antarctic sea ice to PAR through the use of remotely sensed sea ice concentrations, sea ice movement and spatially distributed PAR calculations that account for cloud cover and have applied this model over the past three decades. The resulting spatially distributed estimates of sea ice exposure to PAR by mid-winter are evaluated in context of changes in the timing of sea ice formation that have been documented along the Western Antarctic Peninsula (WAP) region and its potential effects on the variation (seasonal and inter-annual) in the accumulation of sea ice algae in this region. The analysis shows the ice pack is likely to have large inter-annual variations (10-100 fold) in productivity throughout the autumn to winter transition in the sea ice along the WAP. Moreover, the pack ice is likely to have spatial structure in regards to biological processes that cannot be determined from analysis of sea ice concentration information alone. The resulting inter-annual variations in winter processes are likely to affect the dynamics of Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba). © 2010 Springer-Verlag.",2-s2.0-79954426161

A critical aspect in the understanding of the effect of climate change on pelagic systems is the need to progress beyond correlative studies towards a mechanistic understanding. How exactly do changes-oscillations-trends in the environment affect sensitive life cycle stages and thus dictate population size of key species, which in turn have a large impact on the environment? The Polar Regions represent one of the most rapidly warming areas on the globe. Therefore, a model polar organism to study and to understand the effect of climate change on the Southern Ocean ecosystem is Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba). This organism plays a key role in the food web of the Southern Ocean both as grazer of a variety of pelagic invertebrates and algae and as prey for a wide range of Antarctic fish, birds and mammals. The progressing climate change might alter krill's habitat in different ways (e.g. reduced sea ice coverage, changes in food quality and quantity, and a rise in sea water temperature). Long-term studies have already demonstrated that the krill population in the SW Atlantic decreased by about 80 % over the last 30 years and that this decrease is associated with a decline in winter sea ice coverage. It is suggested that the recruitment success of krill is related to seasonal sea ice dynamic but the knowledge of the mechanisms, which link krill population size to environmental variability is lacking. Up to now, the adaptability of krill to their extreme changing environment in short terms due to seasonality (daylight duration, food availability, sea-ice cover) and in long terms due to climate change (increasing sea-water temperature, decline in sea-ice cover, food quantity and quality) is unknown in many cases. However, this knowledge is essential to understand the impact of the progressing global warming trend on the population size of krill and consequently on the Antarctic marine ecosystem.",2-s2.0-84858260455

It also preyed on Antarctic fur seals and gentoo and macaroni penguins during its 2-month temporary residency around the island. The varied diet of this seal exemplifies the generalist prey utilization typical of its species.

Metabolic data, elemental and biochemical composition as well as morphological parameters revealed that, at the beginning of the experiment, krill was in transition from winter to summer physiology, with some features typical for late winter/spring (low lipid reserves, low C:N ratio, elevated O:N ratio) and others for summer (high respiration rates, high MDH activity, large green digestive gland, short intermoult period (IMP) and fast growth). Starvation reduced body reserves drastically by more than 1% C per day. In relative terms, lipids (40%) and glycogen (30%) were reduced most and proteins by 10% of the initial value. Absolute consumption, however, was approximately 4% DM for lipids and proteins each, whereas contribution of glycogen was negligible. Within lipids, triacylglycerols (TAG) and phospholipids (PL) fell most dramatically from already low levels by 84% and 39%, respectively. Phosphatylcholine (PC) constituted 57% of PL and declined by 46%. As a result, proportions of the lipid classes changed with sterols increasing relatively. Metabolite changes were similar in cephalothorax and abdomen, although TAG in the cephalothorax fell more drastically. High metabolic activity at the beginning of starvation was quickly reduced to reach 53% after 18 days, accompanied by a reduction in the abdominal activity of malate dehydrogenase (MDH) by 25%. Our results may provide some explanation why recruitment of some year-classes of krill fails. Despite execution of the experiment in spring (i.e. transitional physiology state) and its short duration, some changes in the activity of metabolic enzymes in the abdomen, representing lipolytic, glycolytic and proteolytic pathways, respectively, were measured. Rising activities of 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase (HOAD) and glyceralaldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) indicated increased lipolytic and glycolytic fluxes, respectively, whereas declining glutamate dehydrogenase (GluDH) activity suggests reduced proteolytic flux. Activities of other enzymes from protein catabolism, alanine aminotransferase (AlaAT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AspAT), however, remained unchanged. Ratios calculated from these trends indicated a declining importance of protein use during the course of starvation compared with consumption of lipids and glycogen. These results suggest that constant-proportion enzymes from different catabolic pathways, and calculated ratios thereof, may be useful in detecting shifts between the consumption of different body reserves. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

We examined this process at the molecular level, to identify processes that are affected when passing a photoperiodic threshold. Antarctic krill captured in the austral autumn were divided into two groups and immediately incubated either under a photoperiod of 12 h light:12 h darkness (LD), simulating the natural light cycle, or in continuous darkness (DD), simulating winter. All other conditions were kept identical between incubations. After 7 days of adaptation, krill were sampled every 4 h over a 24 h period and frozen. Total RNA was extracted from the heads and pooled to construct a suppression subtractive hybridisation library. Differentially expressed sequences were identified and annotated into functional categories through database sequence matching. We found a difference in gene expression between LD and DD krill, with LD krill expressing more genes involved in functions such as metabolism, motor activity, protein binding and various other cellular activities. Eleven of these genes were examined further with quantitative polymerase chain reaction analyses, which revealed that expression levels were significantly higher in LD krill. The genes affected by simulated photoperiodic change are consistent with known features of quiescence, such as a slowing of moult rate, a lowering of activity levels and a reduction in metabolic rate. The expression of proteases involved in apolysis, where the old cuticle separates from the epidermis, showed particular sensitivity to photoperiod and point to the mechanism by which moult rate is adjusted seasonally. Our results show that key processes are already responding at the molecular level after just 7 days of exposure to a changed photoperiodic cycle. We propose that krill switch rapidly between active and quiescent states and that the photoperiodic cycle plays a key role in this process. Crown Copyright © 2009.",2-s2.0-70349961490

Here we consider data collected at South Georgia during 3 summer surveys that recorded substantial hydrographic variability. A suite of bottom-up and top-down controlling factors were measured simultaneously at the mesoscale. Sea surface temperature varied by &gt;2°C, macronutrients ranged from near-winter concentrations to near-depleted, while mean densities of a major grazer, krill Euphausia superba, varied between near-zero and &gt;400 g wet mass m-2. A general linear model was used to identify the main factors implicated in the observed differences in phytoplankton biomass. Despite east-to-west and on-to off-shelf temperature gradients, temperature per se was not implicated in phytoplankton variability. Also, while there was an abundance of NO3-N in surface waters, NH4-N was the key nutrient throughout. A domed relationship between phytoplankton and krill peaked between 2 and 4 mg chlorophyll a m-3 and 6 and 30 g krill m-2. The positive side of this dome was represented by the west off-shelf region downstream of South Georgia. Here, an ample supply of micro-and macronutrients promoted high primary production, and low densities of krill presumably had little grazing effect. This positive relationship between krill and phytoplankton biomasses was interpreted as krill accumulating in areas of good feeding conditions. The negative side of the dome was typified by the east off-shelf region, where macronutrients remained high, primary production rates were low, and krill densities were very high. The grazing rates calculated here suggested that krill affect their food stocks severely, and the negative krill-phytoplankton relationship in this region may reflect locally high krill densities driving down their food supply. © 2009 Inter-Research.",2-s2.0-70450191254

We focused on the macaroni penguin Eudyptes chrysolophus at Kerguelen, the single largest consumer of marine prey among all seabirds. Overall, macaroni penguins performed very long winter trips, remaining at sea during approximately six months within the limits of the Southern Ocean. They departed from Kerguelen in an eastward direction and distributed widely, over more than 3.106 km2. The penguins spent most of their time in a previously unrecognized foraging area, i.e. a narrow latitudinal band (47-49° S) within the central Indian Ocean (70-110° E), corresponding oceanographically to the Polar Frontal Zone. There, their blood isotopic niche indicated that macaroni penguins preyed mainly upon crustaceans, but not on Antarctic krill Euphausia superba, which does not occur at these northern latitudes.

The dominant krill species in the Northeast Pacific Euphausia pacifica and Thysanoessa spinifera, were compared to the two major Antarctic species, Euphausia superba and E. crystallorophias. Analysis comprised total lipid and lipid classes together with individual fatty acid and sterol composition in adults, juveniles, and larvae. Antarctic krill had much higher lipid content than their temperate relatives (10-50 and 5-20% of dry mass for Antarctic and temperate species, respectively) with significant seasonal variations observed. Phospholipids were the dominant lipid class in both temperate krill species, while neutral storage lipids (wax esters and triacylglycerols for E. crystallorophias and E. superba, respectively) were the major lipid class in Antarctic krill and accounted for up to 40% of the total lipid content. Important fatty acids, specifically 16:0, 18:1ω9, 20:5ω3, and 22:6ω3, were detected in all four krill species, with minor differences between species and seasons. Detailed lipid profiles suggest that krill alter their lipid composition with life stage and season. In particular, larval Antarctic krill appear to utilize alternate food resources (i.e., sea-ice associated organisms) during austral winter in contrast to juveniles and adults (i.e., seston and copepods). Lipid dynamics in krill among krill in both systems appear closely linked to their life cycle and environmental conditions including food availability, and can provide a more complete comparative ecology of euphausiids in these environmentally distinct systems. © 2009 Springer-Verlag.",2-s2.0-67349155314

The one remaining seal then migrated north, to the east side of the South Sandwich Islands in 3 weeks, whereafter it headed east, until contact was lost at 55°S in early September. From mid-May to late September this animal always stayed close to the edge of the pack ice.

The condition of larvae was quantified in both seasons by determining their body length (BL), dry weight (DW), elemental and biochemical composition, stomach content analysis, and rates of metabolism and growth. Overall the larvae in autumn were in better condition under the ice than in open water, and for those under the ice, condition decreased from autumn to winter. Thus, growth rates of furcilia larvae in open water in autumn were similar to winter values under the ice (mean, 0.008 mm d″1), whereas autumn under-ice values were higher (0.015 mm d-1). Equivalent larval stages in winter had up to 30% shorter BL and 70% lower DW than in autumn. Mean respiration rates of winter larvae were 43% lower than of autumn larvae. However, their ammonium excretion rates doubled in winter from 0.03 to 0.06 μg NH4 DW-1 h-1, resulting in mean O:N ratios of 46 in autumn and 15 in winter. Thus, differing metabolic substrates were used between autumn and winter, which supports a degree of flexibility for overwintering of larval krill. The larvae were eating small copepods (Oithona spp.) and protozoans, as well as autotrophic food under the ice. The interplay between under-ice topography, apparent current speed under sea ice, and the swimming ability of larval krill is probably critical to whether larval krill can maintain position and exploit suitable feeding areas under the ice. © 2009, by the American Society of Limnology and Oceanography, Inc.",2-s2.0-67949090996

Exposure occurs in spring to autumn during vertical diel migration and during occasional daytime surface-swarming. We have investigated colour change in Antarctic krill, Euphausia superba, during summer and winter in the Lazarev Sea in response to ultraviolet radiation (UVR) and photosynthetically active radiation (PAR). Short-term physiological colour change and long-term (seasonal) morphological colour change are present. Both are facilitated by a single type of monochromatic red chromatophore, i.e. erythrophores, of 20-450μm diameter. Superficial erythrophores cover large dorsal areas, especially above vital organs (brain, sinus glands), additional 'profound' erythrophores cover internal organs (heart, gut, nerve cords). Short-term change in light regime causes rapid physiological colour change along dense bundles of microtubules: pigment disperses into chromorhizae upon exposure to PAR and UVA and to a lesser extent to UVB. Darkness leads to aggregation of pigment in the centre and hence blanching. There is no circadian rhythm in the dispersal state of erythrophores present in winter. Physiological colour change in adult krill is two to three times more rapid in summer than in winter. Furthermore, seasonal changes in light regime also result in a profound morphological colour change: in summer animals, abdominal astaxanthin concentration is 450% and erythrophore count is 250-480% higher than in winter krill. We conclude from our results, that pigmentation of E. superba serves in the protection from harmful solar radiation and is adapted to the varying diel and seasonal light conditions.",2-s2.0-57449121402

Even though the Antarctic Ecosystem as a whole has been identified as a functional unit, subsystems could be identified and characterized, among which, the Antarctic Peninsula stands out for its particular geography, oceanography and trophic web. The aim of this work is to construct a mass balanced model describing the main trophic interactions of this community. The model is built using the software Ecopath with Ecosim 5.0, which yields a representation of the trophic web and estimations of global ecosystem properties. Phytoplankton, zooplankton and krill accounted for most of the mass flow. Flows to the trophic level II (TL II; detritivores and herbivores) were attributed to zooplanktonic and benthic organisms mainly. Flows to the TL III were explained by fish, birds (flying birds and penguins), Balaenoptera acutorostrata and baleen whales. Flows to the TL IV were dominated by some fish, birds (flying birds and penguins) and mammals. Finally, in TL VI, the flows were dominated by Orcinus orca. O. orca was the top predator in the ecosystem with a TL of 4.88, followed by Physeter catodon (4.63) and Hydrurga leptonyx (4.62). Krill was found at the intermediate TL (2.33). Resulting ecosystem indexes (e.g. total transfer efficiency, connectance index, etc.) were consistent and characteristic of ecosystems of high temporal and spatial variability. The model gives a comprehensive description of the food web dominated by phytoplankton-krill-top predators chain, and complemented with alternative food pathways (e.g. through Electrona antarctica), which together gives an enhanced complexity to the system. Despite the limitations of the model in data gaps, particularly for winter season, grouping of functional groups, steady state assumptions, etc., it improves the description of the trophic structure and ecosystem functioning of the Antarctic Peninsula and highlights gaps in knowledge. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

In addition, assessments of change in this region are hampered by the strong seasonal bias in sampling, with the vast majority of data collected during the austral summer. However, oceanographic measurements near South Georgia span most of the last century, and we here consider almost year-round data from this location over an 81-year period (1925-2006). We observe significant warming between the early and late 20th century, with differential warming between summer and winter months and an indication that late 20th century summer temperatures peaked ∼6 days earlier. To quantify the long-term warming trend in this highly variable data, a mixed model utilising a Residual Maximum Likelihood (REML) method was used. Over the 81-year period, a mean increase of ∼0.9 °C in January and ∼2.3 °C in August was evident in the top 100 m of the water column. Warming diminished below 100 m and approached 0 at 200 m. Thus the long-term warming around South Georgia is substantial-more so than documented previously for the circumpolar warming of the Southern Ocean. We examine potential causal effects of this trend, including local atmospheric and cryospheric change, the influence of upstream waters and the role of coupled modes of climate variability such as El Niño/Southern Oscillation and the Southern Annular Mode (SAM). It is likely that all of these play a part in the observed temperature increase. However, the role of the SAM is strongly indicated, via its likely role in the circumpolar warming trend in the Southern Ocean, and also by the atypical response of the South Georgia region to changes in heat fluxes associated with the SAM. Furthermore, the combination of a regional decline in ice extent and strong upstream warming likely explains a significant part of the strong seasonal variation apparent in the warming trend. In addition, we consider the implications that long-term warming has for South Georgia's lower trophic levels. For Euphausia superba, at their northern limit, we find a significant negative relationship between summer South Georgia water temperatures and mean summer density of E. superba across the southwest Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean. Simple abundance and growth rate relationships with our long-term temperature data appear to show declining habitat suitability for E. superba. In contrast, the warming trend is likely to favour other macro- and mesozooplankton species that occupy the more northerly parts of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current, and it is likely to promote phytoplankton growth. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Identification of DNA sequence diversity is a powerful means for assessing the species present in environmental samples. The most common molecular strategies for estimating taxonomic composition depend upon PCR with universal primers that amplify an orthologous DNA region from a range of species. The diversity of sequences within a sample that can be detected by universal primers is often compromised by high concentrations of some DNA templates. If the DNA within the sample contains a small number of sequences in relatively high concentrations, then less concentrated sequences are often not amplified because the PCR favours the dominant DNA types. This is a particular problem in molecular diet studies, where predator DNA is often present in great excess of food-derived DNA. Results. We have developed a strategy where a universal PCR simultaneously amplifies DNA from food items present in DNA purified from stomach samples, while the predator's own DNA is blocked from amplification by the addition of a modified predator-specific blocking primer. Three different types of modified primers were tested out; one annealing inhibiting primer overlapping with the 3' end of one of the universal primers, another annealing inhibiting primer also having an internal modification of five dI molecules making it a dual priming oligo, and a third elongation arrest primer located between the two universal primers. All blocking primers were modified with a C3 spacer. In artificial PCR mixtures, annealing inhibiting primers proved to be the most efficient ones and this method reduced predator amplicons to undetectable levels even when predator template was present in 1000 fold excess of the prey template. The prey template then showed strong PCR amplification where none was detectable without the addition of blocking primer. Our method was applied to identifying the winter food of one of the most abundant animals in the world, the Antarctic krill, Euphausia superba. Dietary item DNA was PCR amplified from a range of species in krill stomachs for which we had no prior sequence knowledge. Conclusion. We present a simple, robust and cheap method that is easily adaptable to many situations where a rare DNA template is to be PCR amplified in the presence of a higher concentration template with identical PCR primer binding sites. © 2008 Vestheim and Jarman; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",2-s2.0-49749128451

To study the nature of the black spots, the krill were sampled in the winter of 2003, 2006, and 2007 in the South Georgia region, the Antarctic Ocean. Histological observations revealed that the black spots were melanized nodules that were composed of hemocytes surrounding either bacteria or amorphous material. In the 2007 samples, 42% of the krill had melanized nodules. Most of the nodules had an opening on the body surface of the krill. A single melanized nodule often contained more than one type of morphologically distinct bacterial cell. Three bacteria were isolated from these black spots, and classified into either Psychrobacter or Pseudoalteromonas based on the sequences of 16S rRNA genes. More than three bacterial species or strains were also confirmed by in situ hybridization for 16S rRNA. The melanized nodules were almost always accompanied by a mass of atypical, large heteromorphic cells, which were not observed in apparently healthy krill. Unidentified parasites were observed in some of the krill that had melanized nodules. These parasites were directly surrounded by the large heteromorphic cells. Histological observations suggested that these heteromorphic cells were attacking the parasites. These results suggest the possibility that the krill had been initially affected by parasite infections, and the parasitized spots were secondary infected by environmental bacteria after the parasites had escaped from the host body. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

In this modeling approach data sets on the biochemical composition of krill and its food sources are combined into a model that takes food quality into account rather than just food availability during different seasons. Krill is defined in terms of protein, neutral lipid, polar lipid, carbohydrate, chitin, and ash content, and the model tracks krill neutral lipid content separately from weight. The model includes parameterizations of filtration, ingestion, and metabolic processes which determine krill growth rate. Initial ratios of protein, neutral lipid, polar lipid, carbohydrate and ash change in chitin response to the biochemical composition of food as krill grows. Model results show that a diet of phytoplankton food alone may be sufficient for krill to grow to observed sizes but may not be sufficient to provide the summer lipid resources that are observed in the field and that are necessary for krill to reproduce and survive winter. The inclusion of sea ice algae as an additional food is beneficial for krill at the end of winter but does not significantly change summer krill lipid content. However, the amount of lipids accumulated within krill increases significantly when krill feeds on lipid-rich heterotrophic food, which points to the importance of carnivory, even in times when phytoplankton food is available. The strategy of combusting body components to produce energy (shrinking) is found to provide the greatest source of energy for krill of all sizes during times of prolonged starvation. © Inter-Research 2008.",2-s2.0-46949098936

The sexual maturity of female and male krill exposed to LL and LD 12:12 showed an accelerated succession of external maturity stages during the experimental period, while krill exposed to continuous darkness showed no changes in external maturity during the course of the study. Changes in the maturity development of krill between the different light regimes are reflected in changes in body composition. Krill exposed to LL and LD 12:12 showed an increase in lipid utilization, indicating that the development of external maturation may be fuelled preferentially by lipid reserves. In contrast, values of total lipid content of krill held under continuous darkness indicated an unchanged lipid catabolism during the course of the study. Thus, the maturity development of krill was affected either directly or indirectly by the different simulated light conditions. Based on these results, and observations on the effects of simulated light regimes on feeding and metabolic rates of krill available from a previous study, we suggest that the Antarctic light regime is an essential cue governing the seasonal cycle of krill physiology and maturity, and highlight the importance of this environmental factor in the life history of krill. © 2008 Springer-Verlag.",2-s2.0-41849131444

The distribution of krill aggregations was characterized by many small aggregations closely spaced relative to one another, punctuated by much fewer aggregations of very large size that accounted for the majority of overall biomass in the region. The greatest number of aggregations was found at depths less than 100 m, but biomass was usually greatest at deeper depths. Similar biomass levels were estimated for both the fall surveys and the winter of 2002 survey, while biomass during the winter of 2001 was an order of magnitude smaller. During fall, biomass estimates vertically integrated over the sampled portion of the water column were negatively associated with chlorophyll a concentrations, and some suggestion was observed of highest biomass in regions of lowest current magnitude and horizontal current gradient. Generalized additive models indicated that highest krill biomass was consistently associated with regions close to land where the temperature maximum below 200 m depth was cooler than what was available over the shelf as a whole. Krill were thus not associated with regions where intrusions of warm and nutrient-rich circumpolar deep water onto the shelf were present, despite such intrusions being thought to be an important driver of primary productivity. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Here, we investigate how the diving patterns of crabeater seals vary in response to these habitat characteristics, and interpret seal behaviors in light of information on the distribution of their primary prey, krill (Euphausia superba or Euphausia crystallorophias). Diving and movement patterns were obtained from 34 seals (16 male, 18 female) fitted with satellite-relayed data loggers (SRDLs) during the 2001 and 2002 Southern Ocean GLOBEC cruises. Tags transmitted position and dive information for 4-174 days, during which time we received an average of 21 positions/day, and information on a total of 124,681 dives. A series of generalized linear mixed-effect models (GLMM) were used to evaluate the relationship between diving behavior and temporal and physical features of the habitat, and models contrasted using AICc and BIC weights. Overall, we found that the most parsimonious models included year, month, and period (day, dusk, night). In general, seals dived deeper (158 vs. 73 m) and longer (432 vs. 360 s) during the day than at night. In addition, daytime dives included slightly more time at the foraging depths (142 vs. 102 s), and were slightly more efficient (24% vs. 21% of the dive cycle spent at the bottom). When dive patterns were examined with respect to bathymetry, models indicated that seals were foraging in shallower waters (366 vs. 410 m) and closer to the bottom (dives were 50.3% vs. 26.3% of bathymetric depth) during the day than at night. In combination, these findings suggest that crabeater seals foraging during the day exploited zooplankton schools compressed along the bottom. At night, when zooplankton were dispersed and light levels low, foraging activity was less frequent and seals concentrated their diving closer to the surface over a broader range of habitat depths. As individual seals moved an average of only 4.1±1.4 km between daytime and nighttime positions, these results suggest that crabeater seals diving along the Western Antarctic Peninsula select areas of high bathymetric gradients so that they can maximize foraging success over a 24-h cycle without the need to travel long distances. However, annual differences in behavior and the generally low amount of deviation explained by models also suggests that seals vary their diving behavior in response to finer-scale biological, temporal, and/or physical features that were not monitored as part of this study. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

There were no differences in body composition between adult males and females or between autumn and late winter. These findings suggest that by autumn, adult seals have replenished their energy stores following reproduction and molt. Similarly, the absence of seasonal variation in adults indicates that seals are successfully foraging throughout winter.

Melatonin was quantified by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) purified extracts of eyestalks and hemolymph of krill sampled in the Lazarev Sea during the Antarctic winter and summer. In addition, oxygen uptake rates and the activities of the metabolic enzyme malate dehydrogenase (MDH) were recorded to assess the metabolic status of krill. Validation of melatonin measurements was carried out on the basis of three different extraction methods with parallel determination of melatonin by ELISA in crude extracts and in HPLC purified extracts, and after derivatization of melatonin under alkaline conditions in the presence of hydrogen peroxide. A significantly higher respiration rate and MDH activity was found in summer krill than in winter krill indicating that krill was in a state of reduced metabolic activity during winter. However, neither during winter nor during summer there were detectable melatonin concentrations in the visual system or hemolymph of krill.

Here we examine the role of physical and biological processes in generating fluctuations in the ecosystem around South Georgia in the South Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean. Anomalies in sea surface temperature (SST) in the South Pacific sector of the Southern Ocean have previously been shown to be generated through atmospheric teleconnections with El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO)-related processes. These SST anomalies are propagated via the Antarctic Circumpolar Current into the South Atlantic (on time scales of more than 1 year), where ENSO and Southern Annular Mode-related atmospheric processes have a direct influence on short (less than six months) time scales. We find that across the South Atlantic sector, these changes in SST, and related fluctuations in winter sea ice extent, affect the recruitment and dispersal of Antarctic krill. This oceanographically driven variation in krill population dynamics and abundance in turn affects the breeding success of seabird and marine mammal predators that depend on krill as food. Such propagating anomalies, mediated through physical and trophic interactions, are likely to be an important component of variation in ocean ecosystems and affect responses to longer term change. Population models derived on the basis of these oceanic fluctuations indicate that plausible rates of regional warming of 1°C over the next 100 years could lead to more than a 95% reduction in the biomass and abundance of krill across the Scotia Sea by the end of the century. © 2007 The Royal Society.",2-s2.0-36849007105

The backscattering strength is used to determine the characteristics of the near-surface scattering layer, which south of the Southern Antarctic Circumpolar Current Front (SACCF) is dominated by Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba). Diel vertical migration in the upper 150 m was the dominant variability observed in any single transect. When averaged over depth, there was a well-defined annual cycle in backscattering strength, with a factor of four increase from a late-winter minimum to a spring-summer maximum over a period of four months, followed by a more gentle decline during late summer and autumn. In addition, there were significant differences in scattering strength north and south of the Polar Front (PF) on both seasonal and interannnual time-scales. The average summer maximum to the north of the PF was more than twice the maximum to the south, but the winter minima were about the same. On interannual time-scales, scattering strength south of the PF displayed a negative linear trend primarily attributable to a fourfold decrease in backscattering strength south of the SACCF. No significant long-term trend in the scattering strength north of the SACCF was observed. © 2007 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea. Published by Oxford Journals.

A distinct seasonal pattern in krill density, recurring consistently over all three years, was detected. Krill densities in winter were predominantly low (mean = 18.7 g m-2, SD = 24.3), but had risen substantially by summer in each year (mean = 89.5 g m-2, SD = 64.2). A sinusoidal regression model (period = 52 weeks) with time as the independent variable explained 64% of the observed week-toweek variation. Estimates of krill density from moored instruments were not statistically different (P &gt; 0.05) from estimates derived from standard ship-based krill surveys in adjacent time periods, suggesting that the point estimates from moored instruments were representative of krill density in a wider spatial context (ship surveys cover c. 100 × 100 km). Data from moored instruments were used to explore whether high-frequency temporal variation (i.e. within-year) could have led to the perceived between-year variation in krill density arising from previous summer surveys in the South Georgia western core box region between 1990 and 2005. Comparison of these 'snap-shot' ship survey estimates with the observed pattern of within-year variability showed that some of the apparent 'year-to-year' variation could simply be attributed to sampling on different dates of the year (e.g. November cf. February). However, there were some survey estimates that were significantly different (P &lt; 0.01) from the regression-predicted within-year variation. Years that stand out for markedly low krill density (i.e. densities below the range expected due to intra-annual variation) were 1993/94, 1998/99 and 1999/2000. Moored instruments provide valuable data that could be important for ecosystem-based management at South Georgia because, for example, they will enable predator-prey functional responses to be explored there for the first time at appropriate temporal scales, and will enable hypotheses relating variation in krill abundance to physical oceanographic variability to be tested.",2-s2.0-36249006056

Moving from correlations with environmental parameters to an understanding of the mechanisms that lead to these correlations may allow predictions of the consequences of climate change on the distribution of favourable habitat for Antarctic krill. During winter cruises in 2001 and 2002 in the region west of the Antarctic Peninsula, one of the most rapidly warming regions on the planet, ice camps were established for periods of 3-9 days. Timing of sea ice advance, chlorophyll a concentrations in ice cores, and growth rates and pigment content of larval krill all differed significantly between winters. Growth rates and pigment content of larval krill from the same ice floe were correlated, suggesting that growth rates in winter are a function of the biomass of the sea ice microbial community. A possible mechanism underlying the correlation between recruitment success and timing of ice advance is proposed. In conjunction with other postulated habitat requirements, this proposed mechanism allows for speculation about future changes in the geographic location of favourable habitat for Antarctic krill. © Antarctic Science Ltd.",2-s2.0-34249045953

We investigated whether reproduction and early larval development are the cause of local recruitment failure. It was found that the majority of adult females were reproductively active in summer and that there was a comparatively high investment in the ovary, reaching up to 46 % of the total wet weight of the krill. The corresponding egg batches were amongst the largest ever reported for E. superba. A semi-empirical model predicted that 11 % of females completed just 1 spawning episode per year, 60 % completed 2, and 29 % completed 3 or more. On average, a South Georgian krill released 12 343 eggs yr-1. The eggs were unable to complete the descent-ascent developmental cycle on-shelf because the bathymetry was too shallow but, off-shelf, they were predicted to sink to between 490 and 520 m and return to the surface either as a metanauplius or 1st calyptopis stage with plenty of energy reserves remaining. Feeding conditions were adequate for the development of later larval stages once these reserves were exhausted. Although net surveys found calyptopis and early stage furcilia in the vicinity of South Georgia, numbers were mostly lower than predicted. Overall, reproduction or early stage development are successful in this region, leaving predation on larvae and advective export during winter as the main potential causes of local recruitment failure. © Inter-Research 2007.",2-s2.0-33947109411

The eastward-flowing Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) and waters from the Weddell-Scotia Confluence dominate the physics of the Scotia Sea, leading to a strong advective flow, intense eddy activity and mixing. There is also strong seasonality, manifest by the changing irradiance and sea ice cover, which leads to shorter summers in the south. Summer phytoplankton blooms, which at times can cover an area of more than 0.5 million km2, probably result from the mixing of micronutrients into surface waters through the flow of the ACC over the Scotia Arc. This production is consumed by a range of species including Antarctic krill, which are the major prey item of large seabird and marine mammal populations. The flow of the ACC is steered north by the Scotia Arc, pushing polar water to lower latitudes, carrying with it krill during spring and summer, which subsidize food webs around South Georgia and the northern Scotia Arc. There is also marked interannual variability in winter sea ice distribution and sea surface temperatures that is linked to southern hemisphere-scale climate processes such as the El Niño-Southern Oscillation. This variation affects regional primary and secondary production and influences biogeochemical cycles. It also affects krill population dynamics and dispersal, which in turn impacts higher trophic level predator foraging, breeding performance and population dynamics. The ecosystem has also been highly perturbed as a result of harvesting over the last two centuries and significant ecological changes have also occurred in response to rapid regional warming during the second half of the twentieth century. This combination of historical perturbation and rapid regional change highlights that the Scotia Sea ecosystem is likely to show significant change over the next two to three decades, which may result in major ecological shifts. © 2006 The Royal Society.",2-s2.0-34249978520

The glacially sculpted coastline along the peninsula is highly convoluted and characterized by deep embayments that are often interconnected by channels that facilitate transport of heat and nutrients into the shelf domain. The ecosystem is divided into three subregions, the continental slope, shelf and coastal regions, each with unique ocean dynamics, water mass and biological distributions. The WAP shelf lies within the Antarctic Sea Ice Zone (SIZ) and like other SIZs, the WAP system is very productive, supporting large stocks of marine mammals, birds and the Antarctic krill, Euphausia superba. Ecosystem dynamics is dominated by the seasonal and interannual variation in sea ice extent and retreat. The Antarctic Peninsula is one among the most rapidly warming regions on Earth, having experienced a 2°C increase in the annual mean temperature and a 6°C rise in the mean winter temperature since 1950. Delivery of heat from the Antarctic Circumpolar Current has increased significantly in the past decade, sufficient to drive to a 0.6°C warming of the upper 300 m of shelf water. In the past 50 years and continuing in the twenty-first century, the warm, moist maritime climate of the northern WAP has been migrating south, displacing the once dominant cold, dry continental Antarctic climate and causing multi-level responses in the marine ecosystem. Ecosystem responses to the regional warming include increased heat transport, decreased sea ice extent and duration, local declines in ice-dependent Adélie penguins, increase in ice-tolerant gentoo and chinstrap penguins, alterations in phytoplankton and zooplankton community composition and changes in krill recruitment, abundance and availability to predators. The climate/ecological gradients extending along the WAP and the presence of monitoring systems, field stations and long-term research programmes make the region an invaluable observatory of climate change and marine ecosystem response. © 2006 The Royal Society.",2-s2.0-34249056225

We developed an alternative approach to predicting the trajectory of length over time, using a step-growth function that combines models of instantaneous growth rate (IGR) at moult calibrated from direct measurements of individual pre- and post-moult krill sampled from the wild with a model of temperature-dependent inter-moult period (IMP). Using summer and early autumn data for juveniles and males sampled from the Indian Ocean sector of the Southern Ocean, we modelled IGR as a function of pre-moult length and season using linear mixed models (LMM) incorporating cubic smoothing splines. We generated a number of growth trajectories starting from an Age 1+ yr mean length, for different scenarios of winter and spring growth. We then provided convenient parametric approximations to these step trajectories for use in population dynamic modelling systems using either a punctuated-growth model based on an F-distribution or a seasonal-growth VB model. Alternatively, step-trajectories could be used directly. Our models indicated that, when allowing for shrinkage, at the start of the sixth winter after hatch (Age 5+ yr) the mean length of krill for the Indian Ocean sector was close to 53 mm, compared to 56 mm obtained from studies for the southwest Atlantic Ocean sector. In contrast, when shrinkage was not allowed for, a slightly higher mean length was obtained for krill from the Indian Ocean sector (57.5 mm) compared to krill from the southwest Atlantic Ocean sector. © Inter-Research 2006.",2-s2.0-32644445767

Average acoustically derived krill biomass across the 5 study years was 2.6 g C m-2, 4 to 5 times that of Stages CIV and CV of C. acutus. Mean length of krill was 41 ± 4 mm, and the average growth rate was 0.10 mm d-1, giving an average mass-specific growth rate of 0.0084 d-1.

However, like many top predators, very little information exists on their foraging behaviour outside the breeding season. We investigated the foraging behaviour of the macaroni penguin Eudyptes chrysolophus continuously for 2 consecutive years, from the end of December 2001. This allowed us to investigate whether foraging behaviour varied between sexes, years or phases of the annual cycle. Male penguins tended to dive deeper and longer than female penguins, but at a lower frequency, probably as a result of their larger body size. There was little variation in foraging behaviour between the 2 years studied, although neither year included a notable period of low Antarctic krill abundance. Diving behaviour varied substantially within years and general linear models were used to investigate this variability. In summary, all penguins tended to dive deeper, longer and more efficiently during their winter migration than during the summer breeding season. The penguins dived predominantly during daylight hours at all times of the year, but appeared to be more constrained by daylight during the short winter days.

This time of the year may be a critical period in the krill life cycle because their larvae must switch from feeding on summer phytoplankton blooms to winter ice algae. FIV utilized mainly lipids overall, but also protein during the second half of the 12 d period. After 6 d of starvation most of the larvae lost half of their body C. Body lipid content decreased from 12.7 to 1.5% of dry mass (DM), whereas protein fell from 32.7 to 25.8% of DM. Respiration rates decreased from 1.3 to 0.7-0.8 μl O2 (mg DM)-1 h-1 in the first 3 d, after which they remained roughly constant. These rates correspond to C losses of 2.7 and 2.0% body C d-1 respectively. Excretion rates decreased from 0.04 to 0.02 μg NH4 (mg DM)-1 h-1 until the middle of the starvation period and then rose to 0.05 μg NH4 (mg DM) -1 h-1 by the end, which is probably related to the increase in protein breakdown. Based on these losses of body C and lipid, the FIV larvae may pass their point of no return, where they lose their ability to recover from nutritional stress, after 6 d. © Inter-Research 2005.",2-s2.0-20444494012

To examine spatial and temporal changes over larger scales, we have combined all available scientific net sampling data from 1926 to 2003. This database shows that the productive southwest Atlantic sector contains >50% of Southern Ocean krill stocks, but here their density has declined since the 1970s. Spatially, within their habitat, summer krill density correlates positively with chlorophyll concentrations. Temporally, within the southwest Atlantic, summer krill densities correlate positively with sea-ice extent the previous winter. Summer food and the extent of winter sea ice are thus key factors in the high krill densities observed in the southwest Atlantic Ocean. Krill need the summer phytoplankton blooms of this sector, where winters of extensive sea ice mean plentiful winter food from ice algae, promoting larval recruitment and replenishing the stock. Salps, by contrast, occupy the extensive lower-productivity regions of the Southern Ocean and tolerate warmer water than krill. As krill densities decreased last century, salps appear to have increased in the southern part of their range.

Ten instantaneous growth rate experiments were conducted with larvae collected from the under-ice habitat on the outer shelf, mid-shelf, and just south of Adelaide Island in the mouth of Marguerite Bay.

Lipids in seston and major copepods representing potential diets were collected from the water column and quantified to compare with krill. Stomach contents also were examined in selected adult krill to provide a visual snapshot of ingested material and comparison with lipid biomarkers. Total lipids in adult E. crystallorophias were significantly higher than adult E. superba (30.0% and 20.2% of dry weight, respectively). Wax esters were the major storage lipid in E. crystallorophias, accounting for over half (mean of 55.9%) of the total lipid in adult animals. In contrast, E. superba contained triacylglycerols as the dominant storage lipid in adults (mean of 45.5% of total lipid). Fatty acid and sterol distributions in krill showed minor differences between species and life stages. Larval krill, however, contained higher polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) than sub- and adult krill. While only trace amounts of fatty alcohols were found in E. superba, significant amounts were found in E. crystallorophias, particularly 14:0 and 16:0, which were major components of wax esters. Results for lipid classes, individual lipids, and stomach content suggest that E. superba is less dependent on stored lipid for overwintering than E. crystallorophias. E. superba are omnivorous, with copepods representing a significant dietary source for adults in winter. Furciliae of both species contain lower levels of lipid storage in winter and feed largely on detritus or organisms associated with ice. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",2-s2.0-9744253904

Overwintering survival of larvae has been linked to annual sea-ice formation and extent, as sea-ice biota may provide food when other sources are scarce in the water column. During autumn 2001, larvae were very abundant (1-19 individuals m -3), with younger stages dominant offshelf and older stages dominant on-shelf. On-shelf larvae were in better condition than offshore larvae. During autumn 2002, larvae again were abundant offshelf (0.01-110 m -3), whereas all stages were scarce on-shelf. Declining diatom and radiolarian blooms were present during autumn in both years. Average chlorophyll concentrations were low (0.10 vs. 0.22 μg l -1) in autumn and an order of magnitude lower in winter. Carbon content of larvae during autumn 2001 and 2002 (41% vs. 38% C of DW) suggested that lipid storage was moderate. The median autumn larval growth rate (0.027 mm d -1) was lower and the intermolt period (19 d) longer than reported summer values. During winter, larvae appeared to be food-limited based on the following observations: (1) the median growth rate decreased (0.00 mm d -1) and the intermolt period increased (40 d), (2) larval length-specific dry weight (DW) and % carbon and nitrogen of DW decreased, and (3) 88% of furcilia 6 did not develop to the juvenile stage, but remained at the same stage after molting. Experimental results demonstrated that some larvae could survive starvation for a month by combusting body reserves (ca. 1% decrease in DW and body C and N d -1), implying that a portion of the population was resilient to the suboptimal food supply. Although sea ice formed up to 2 months earlier in 2002, ice algae at the ice-water interface, where it is accessible to krill, was not an abundant food source in either year (0.05 vs. 0.07 μg chl l -1). In winter 2001, furcilia were commonly observed near the undersurface of sea-ice, but only rarely in 2002 until mid-September, when ice algae began to accumulate. Low gut fluorescence values also indicate that little nutrition was derived from autotrophs in winter. Instead, larvae were likely opportunistic scavengers exploiting all available food sources, including microzooplankton, benthic larvae, detritus, scarce phytoplankton and sea-ice biota. In summary, larval krill exhibited several overwintering behaviors: (1) flexible feeding, (2) flexible morphology (i.e., delayed development), (3) flexible physiology (i.e., increased intermolt period, reduced growth), (4) moderate lipid storage, and (5) ability to withstand starvation by combusting body C and N. Because most larvae did not shrink in length, this measure may not be a good indicator of the body combustion strategy. At these high latitudes, sea-ice biota may not be a primary source of food during winter, but progressively more important in spring as irradiance levels increase. Winter survivors during 2001 resulted in a significant recruitment to the juvenile size class during spring. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",2-s2.0-9744247720

During summer, the retreating pack ice creates a meltwater lens in the euphotic zone, allowing primary producers and microheterotrophs to flourish in a discrete bloom just seaward of the retreating ice edge that lasts about 60 days. The purpose of the present study was to see if the ice-edge bloom had a discernible effect on the metabolism and physiological condition of Antarctic micronekton similar to that observed in zooplankton species. We also wished to assess the importance of the summer season to species' life cycles. Two major data sets were collected on 25 species in the following taxonomic groups: amphipods, cephalopods, decapods, euphausiids, isopods, mysids, ostracods, and polychaetes. The first data set described the metabolic rates of individuals in areas of the marginal ice zone with widely different levels of chlorophyll biomass to investigate the effect of the ice-edge bloom on metabolism. Additionally, summer metabolic rates were compared with data from other seasons. The second data set detailed the levels of protein, water, ash, RNA and DNA, and the activities of metabolic enzymes (citrate synthase and malate dehydrogenase) to examine the efficacy of biochemical indices as predictive tools for metabolism. Results suggested that the mobility of the micronektonic species eliminated most direct effects of the bloom on metabolism. Individuals captured in very different productivity regimes showed few significant differences in the metabolic indicators listed above. Isolated cases of changes in body composition and enzyme activity, however, implied that longer-term effects of the bloom may be exhibited. Seasonal increases in metabolism from winter to summer were observed in the euphausiids Euphausia superba, E. triacantha, and Thysanoessa macrura and the amphipod Vibilia stebbingi. It was concluded that the seasonal shifts were indicative of a ""type 2"" or compromise overwintering strategy whereby metabolism drops without an accompanying dormant state. Protein content and MDH activity were found to be the best predictors of respiration rate, while nucleic acid measures only correlated with respiration in immature specimens. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

Previous studies have provided evidence that krill utilize zooplankton through austral winter when the primary production is negligible. Though they are different, all survival strategies produce the same result, a decrease in total zooplankton biomass. It is difficult to examine the total zooplankton biomass balance and process rates from traditional net tow samples because of the spatial variation in zooplankton distribution and the lack of applicable mathematical methods to estimate population process rates. This study focuses on short-term (overnight) loss rates of mesozooplankton associated with adult krill grazing in austral fall and the long-term (winter) body growth and removal rates of mesozooplankton in austral winter based on measurements of zooplankton size structures obtained using an Optical Plankton Counter (OPC) mounted on a Multiple Opening and Closing Nets and Environmental Sensing System (MOCNESS). In order to target an adult Euphausia superba aggregation for a short period, a 153 kHz Vessel-Mounted (VM) Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP) was used for the acoustic backscattering. The in situ process rates of growth and mortality are estimated based on the biomass balance and biomass spectrum theory. The overnight in situ grazing by adult E. superba on mesozooplankton is examined based on the in situ measurements of mesozooplankton biovolume within the water where an adult E. superba aggregation remained during a short study period in late April. The measurements show that approximately 16% of the existing mesozooplankton biovolume was removed in 4 h, which leads to an average specific daily grazing rate of 0.96day -1 assuming a daily feeding period of 16 h from dusk to dawn. From the amount of biovolume removed and the abundance of adult euphausiids of approximately 3 individuals m -3 estimated from the volume backscattering strength and the size of adult euphausiids, the daily ration for an adult euphausiid is approximately equal to 7% body biovolume or biomass day -1. The total mesozooplankton biovolume decreased at a specific rate of 0.017day -1 over the austral winter 2002, while the specific individual body growth was approximately 0.045day -1. The sum of these two rates leads to the specific mortality rate equal to approximately 0.07day -1 for the winter. These rates lead to a system efficiency of 67% for recycling the biomass during the winter. The measurements indicate that approximately 90% of biovolume (biomass) was removed in the period between the fall cruise in April-May and the winter cruise in August-September 2002. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

Subsurface intrusions of upper circumpolar deep water (UCDW) onto the shelf provide much of the nutrient flux into the region. Here we describe the small-scale processes that contribute to upward diapycnal fluxes of heat, salt, and nutrients from the UCDW to the surface-mixed layer. The study makes use of conductivity-temperature-depth and vessel-mounted acoustic Doppler current profiler data collected during three research cruises between April and September 2001. Near-inertial baroclinic waves generated by wind stress provide most of the shear across the sharp pycnocline at the base of the mixed layer. The mean vertical diffusivity associated with shear instability is estimated at ≤1×10-5 m2 s -1, corresponding to a heat flux into the base of the mixed layer of &lt;2 W m-2.

The origin and fate of krill observed during the CCAMLR 2000 survey were studied using output from the OCCAM model. Lagrangian particle tracking for the period prior to the survey showed the expected dominance of the west to east flow of material associated with the main direction of the current flow, but there was no simple association of particle transport with any of the fronts of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current. Most of the krill were associated with areas to the south of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current in the Weddell-Scotia Confluence (WSC) and farther east in Weddell Sea-influenced waters. Examining the pathways of krill transport in relation to satellite-derived sea-ice distributions suggests that particles present in the high krill biomass regions in January would have come from areas that were covered by sea-ice during late winter/early spring (September-October). The results of Eulerian grid-based simulations of the development of the biomass distribution after the survey period showed transport of particles around South Georgia, probably in association with the Southern Antarctic Circumpolar Current Front. However, many of the krill encountered in the eastern Scotia Sea would have exited toward the east, passing north of the South Sandwich Islands, probably in association with the Southern Boundary of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current and Weddell Sea waters that penetrate to the north in this area. These krill may return to more southern regions where further spawning is possible in later years. Simulations of particle tracks that included diurnal vertical migration showed that krill behavior could modify the pathways of transport, although the current flows probably dominate the movement of krill in open ocean regions. This study suggests that the summer distribution of krill in the Scotia Sea is connected to the winter sea-ice distribution and probably to the pattern and rate of the spring sea-ice retreat. Many of the krill in the survey region in the summer of 1999/2000 came from under the sea-ice in the eastern Scotia Sea, the southern Scotia Arc, and the northern Weddell Sea. This highlights that the spatial association of the sea-ice with the Weddell-Scotia Confluence and frontal regions of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current during winter and spring will be crucial in determining the summer krill distribution. Variation in the extent and timing of sea-ice retreat, and fluctuations in Weddell-Scotia Confluence and Scotia Sea flows, will change the pathways of transport resulting in large changes in the distribution of the krill during summer. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

The relationships between the body length and weight of both krill species were exponentially correlated with no significant differences between the two species (p>0.05). The ratio between eye diameter and body length of individual krill was examined in an expectation that it could be used as an indicator of the body shrinkage as previously suggested by Shin and Nicol (2002). These ratios were significantly different between the two krill species. Especially, E. crystallorophias had bigger eyes than E. superba. In both krill species, eye diameters were highly correlated with body lengths (regression coefficients ≥ 0.70). For E. crystallorophias, no significant differences of the ratio of eye diameter/body length were detected between fall and winter. Even though the ratios for E. superba were seasonally varied, it was not clear whether body shrinkage was an actual and critical overwintering mechanism for the krill population found in this study area.

All experiments were carried out during fall and winter months (April through September) on nine separate cruises west of the Antarctic Peninsula between 1987 and 1999. A consistent seasonal pattern across years was observed: growth rates decreased during fall (April/ May), were minimal in early winter (June), and increased to maximum rates by late winter (September). Habitat-specific differences (water column vs under-ice) in growth rates of larvae collected on the same cruise were not observed in early winter (June 1993; within-year comparison). However, in a between-year comparison, larvae from the under-ice habitat (June/July 1987) had significantly higher growth increments than larvae from the open-water habitat (July 1989). The difference between these two comparisons may be a function of the degree of contrast in food availability in the water column and the sea ice at different times in the winter. Daylength at the time of collection explained 74% of the variation in larval and juvenile growth rates.

Intra-and inter-seasonal variations in krill biomass density and dispersion were derived from the re-processed data set for surveys conducted in the austral summers of 1991/1992 through 2001/2002. Estimated biomass density ranged from 1 to 60 g m-2, decreasing from mid-range levels in 1991/1992 to a minimum in 1992/1993-1993/1994, increasing to a peak in 1996/1997-1997/1998, and decreasing again through 2000/2001-2001/2002. Although this variability may be attributed to changes in the spatial distribution of krill relative to the survey area, comparisons with the proportion of juvenile krill in simultaneous net samples suggest that the changes in biomass density are consistent with apparent changes in reproductive success. A truncated Fourier series fit to the biomass density time series is dominated by an 8-year cycle and predicts an increase in krill biomass density in 2002/2003 and 2003/2004. This prediction is supported by an apparent association between cycles in the extent of sea ice cover and per-capita krill recruitment over the last 23 years and indications that ice cover in the winter of 2002 is seasonally early and extensive. © 2003 Éditions scientifiques et médicales Elsevier SAS and Ifremer/IRD/Inra/Cemagref.

A mean oxygen consumption and nitrogen excretion ratio of 31.1 measured on board ship at ambient ocean temperatures suggested that larval and juvenile krill from ice-covered waters were primarily herbivorous.

It has been previously shown that laboratory-shrunk krill tend to conserve the size of the eye. This study examined whether the relationship between the eye diameter and body length could be used to detect whether krill had been shrinking. By tracking individuals over time and examining specimens sampled as groups, it was demonstrated that fed and starved krill are distinguishable by the relationship between the eye diameter and body length. The eye diameter of starved krill did not decrease, even when the animals had shrunk in overall body length. The eye diameter of well-fed krill continued to increase as overall length increased. This created a distinction between fed and starved krill, while no separation was detected in terms of the body length to weight relationship. Eye growth of krill re-commenced with re-growth of krill following shrinkage although there was some time lag. It would take approximately 2 moult cycles of shrinkage at modest rates to significantly change the eye diameter to body length relationship between normal and shrunk krill. If krill starve for a prolonged period in the wild, and hence shrink, the eye diameter to body length relationship should be able to indicate this.

In winter the pack ice canopy extends to cover almost 20 million square kilometres - some 8% of the southern hemisphere and an area larger than the Antarctic continent itself (13.2 million square kilometres) - and is one of the largest, most dynamic ecosystems on earth. Biological activity is associated with all physical components of the sea-ice system: the sea-ice surface; the internal sea-ice matrix and brine channel system; the underside of sea ice and the waters in the vicinity of sea ice that are modified by the presence of sea ice. Microbial and microalgal communities proliferate on and within sea ice and are grazed by a wide range of proto- and macrozooplankton that inhabit the sea ice in large concentrations. Grazing organisms also exploit biogenic material released from the sea ice at ice break-up or melt. Although rates of primary production in the underlying water column are often low because of shading by sea-ice cover, sea ice itself forms a substratum that provides standing stocks of bacteria, algae and grazers significantly higher than those in ice-free areas. Decay of sea ice in summer releases particulate and dissolved organic matter to the water column, playing a major role in biogeochemical cycling as well as seeding water column phytoplankton blooms. Numerous zooplankton species graze sea-ice algae, benefiting additionally because the overlying sea-ice ceiling provides a refuge from surface predators. Sea ice is an important nursery habitat for Antarctic krill, the pivotal species in the Southern Ocean marine ecosystem. Some deep-water fish migrate to shallow depths beneath sea ice to exploit the elevated concentrations of some zooplankton there. The increased secondary production associated with pack ice and the sea-ice edge is exploited by many higher predators, with seals, seabirds and whales aggregating there. As a result, much of the Southern Ocean pelagic whaling was concentrated at the edge of the marginal ice zone. The extent and duration of sea ice fluctuate periodically under the influence of global climatic phenomena including the El Niño Southern Oscillation. Life cycles of some associated species may reflect this periodicity. With evidence for climatic warming in some regions of Antarctica, there is concern that ecosystem change may be induced by changes in sea-ice extent. The relative abundance of krill and salps appears to change interannually with sea-ice extent, and in warm years, when salps proliferate, krill are scarce and dependent predators suffer severely. Further research on the Southern Ocean sea-ice system is required, not only to further our basic understanding of the ecology, but also to provide ecosystem managers with the information necessary for the development of strategies in response to short- and medium-term environmental changes in Antarctica. Technological advances are delivering new sampling platforms such as autonomous underwater vehicles that are improving vastly our ability to sample the Antarctic under sea-ice environment. Data from such platforms will enhance greatly our understanding of the globally important Southern Ocean sea-ice ecosystem.",2-s2.0-0036322973

Both nonfeeding strategies (reduced metabolism, lipid use, or shrinkage in size) and switching to other foods (carnivory, ice algae, or detritus) have been suggested. We examined these alternatives in the southwest Lazarev Sea in autumn (April 1999), when sea ice was forming and phytoplankton was at winter concentrations. Both juveniles and adults had a very high lipid content (36% and 44% of dry mass, respectively) of which >40% was phospholipid. However, their low O:N ratios suggested that these reserves were not being used. Results from gut contents analysis and large volume incubations agreed that juveniles fed mainly on phytoplankton and adults fed on small (<3 mm) copepods. This dietary difference was supported possibly by elevated concentrations of 20:1 and 22:1 fatty acids in the adults. The feeding methods also confirmed that feeding rates were low compared with those in summer. Even when acclimated to high food concentrations, clearance and ingestion rates were <30% of summer rates. Respiration and ammonium excretion rates of freshly caught krill were 60%-80% of those in summer and declined significantly during 18 d of starvation. These findings suggest both switch feeding and energy conservation strategies, with a trend of reduced and more carnivorous feeding with ontogeny. This points to a ""compromise"" strategy for postlarvae, but there are alternative explanations. First, the krill may have reduced their feeding in an autumn transition to a nonfeeding mode, and, second, some of the population may have maintained a high feeding effort whereas the remainder was not feeding.",2-s2.0-0036073040

This paper summarizes data on breeding success of a krill-dependent predator, the Wilson's storm petrel Oceanites oceanicus, in a colony on King George Island, South Shetland Islands, Antarctica, over four breeding seasons from 1995/1996 to 1999/2000. The seasons differed greatly in environmental conditions and in the resulting food availability which was reflected in inter- and intra-annual variations in feeding frequency. The breeding success was consequently variable. Starvation, the main cause of chick mortality in three out of four breeding seasons was associated with reduced sea ice cover in winter, which is known to depress food availability in the following breeding season. Food delivery rates also depended on the prevailing winds, which drive the transport of zooplankton-rich water masses. Snowstorms caused additional chick mortality in two out of four seasons when nest burrows became blocked.

Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) and krill-dependent predators such as fish, seals, and birds are abundant there, and most krill fisheries have operated in this area since 1970s. The hottest issues for the proper management of krill resources nowadays are to determine total biomass in this area, and to identify environmental forces controlling stock fluctuation. This paper reviews and collates information on ongoing oceanographic activities in the Antarctic Peninsula region concerning these issues. To delineate the status and function of Antarctic krill population in Antarctic marine ecosystems, multinational researches along the Antarctic Peninsula area have been developing recently. Four member states of CCAMLR (Japan, Russia, UK, and USA) had conducted acoustic surveys in January-February 2000 (socalled CCAMLR-2000 survey), and krill standing stock at 120 kHz was estimated to be 44.29 million metric tonnes in the western Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean. On the other hand, the Southern Ocean GLOBEC (SO-GLOBEC) Programme has prepared a serial winter survey to examine the factors that govern krill survivorship and distribution in relation to shelf circulation processes. Ship-based surveys using ice-breakers are being conducted by three nations (Germany, UK, and USA) around the Marguerite Bay during the austral fall and winter 2001 and 2002. In addition to these two large-scale surveys, some CCAMLR members have carried out joint oceanographic surveys near the South Shetland Islands to detect ecosystem changes since 1994. Especially from December 1999 to February 2000, in conjunction with CCAMLR-2000 survey, four nations (Japan, Korea, Peru, and USA) conducted acoustic surveys to produce time-series information on krill distribution and biomass near the South Shetland areas. Though the aims of each program and the approach to solve the scientific questions were different each other, the results from each program fill the gaps between programs. Further cooperation and exchange in these activities could be beneficial to each program.",2-s2.0-0035735421

The total-lipid data for E. superba exhibited seasonal variations, with low lipid levels in late winter/early spring and the highest levels in autumn. Seasonal changes were most pronounced in the immature and adult specimens, increasing from about 10% lipid of dry mass to more than 40%. The fatty-acid compositions of the younger stages were dominated by 20:5(n-3), 22:6(n-3) and 16:0. These are typical phospholipid fatty acids, which are major biomembrane constituents. The phospholipid composition was similar in the older stages. With increasing storage of triacylglycerols in the lipid-rich immature and adult stages, the fatty acids 14:0, 16:0 and 18:1(n-9) prevailed, comprising about 70% of total triacylglycerol fatty acids. The trophic-marker fatty acids 16:1(n-7) and 18:4(n-3), indicating phytoplankton ingestion, were less abundant. They reflected, however, the dependence of the larvae on phytoplankton as well as the seasonal changes in algal composition. The generally close linear relationships between fatty acids and lipid suggest that the fatty-acid compositions of the collected specimens were largely independent of the respective developmental stage, season and region. The linear fit indicates that triacylglycerol accumulation started at a level of about 5% of total lipid. Considering the various overwintering scenarios under discussion, the life cycle and reproductive strategies of krill are discussed in the context of the lipid metabolism and fatty-acid composition of E. superba. Lipid production is effective enough to accumulate large energy reserves for the dark season, but E. superba does not exhibit the sophisticated biosynthetic pathways known from other Antarctic euphausiids and copepods. Although important, lipid utilisation appears to be just one of several strategies of E. superba to thrive under the extreme Antarctic conditions, and this pronounced versatility may explain the success of this species in the Southern Ocean.",2-s2.0-0034895642

The Arctic Thysanoessa inermis and the Antarctic Euphausia crystallorophias contain high levels of wax esters and higher concentrations of 18:4(n-3) and 20:5(n-3) and a lower ratio of 18:1(n-9)/(n-7) fatty acids in their neutral lipids than the Arctic Thysanoessa raschii and the Antarctic Thysanoessa macrura and Euphausia superba.

The metabolic processes included in the model are ingestion, a baseline respiration, respiratory losses due to feeding and digestion, and an activity-based respiration factor. The total of these processes, net production, was used as the basis for determining the growth or shrinkage of individuals. Size-dependent parameterizations for the metabolic processes were constructed from field and laboratory measurements. Environmental effects were included through time series of pelagic phytoplankton concentration that were derived from data sets collected west of the Antarctic Peninsula. Simulated growth rates during the spring and summer for all krill size classes were consistent with published growth rates; however, initial results indicated that winter shrinkage rates were too large. Although the use of a seasonally varying respiration activity factor (reduced winter respiration rates) resulted in winter shrinkage rates of adults that were consistent with observations of experimentally starved individuals, the annual change in length of specific size classes was still inconsistent with observations. Subsequent simulations examined the effect of ingestion of sea ice algae by krill in the late winter and early spring. The annual growth cycle best matched observations, particularly those for larval and subadult krill (<35 mm), when reduced winter respiration rates and ingestion of sea ice algae were both included. These results suggest that the ability of krill to exploit a range of food sources and reduced winter metabolism rates are the mechanisms that allow krill to successfully overwinter.

Analyses of acoustic observations revealed distinct seasonal variations in estimates of krill abundance, the dimensional parameters used to characterize individual krill aggregations, the geographic area over which krill were acoustically detected, and the depth distribution of krill biomass. Spatially averaged estimates of krill biomass were an order of magnitude higher in spring (32 gm-2) and summer (95 gm-2) compared to fall (12 g m-2) and winter (8 g m-2).

This paper investigates their coincidence across a wide range of temporal and spatial scales to examine whether copepod distribution is related to that of krill. During 2 summers of high krill abundance near South Georgia (1996 and 1997) copepod abundance was <40% of that during an abnormally low krill year (1994). No such depletion was found north of the Polar Front, where krill were rare. Analysis of 2 mesoscale data sets showed that krill, rather than food or environmental factors, were most strongly implicated in copepod distribution. An area of persistently high krill abundance just north of South Georgia was characterised by exceptionally few copepods. Fine-scale relationships between patches of krill and copepods were studied with a Longhurst Hardy Plankton Recorder. Within krill swarms copepod abundance was low, but more dispersed krill associated with high concentrations of copepods. Copepods also appeared to live deeper and to make more extensive vertical migrations when krill were present. The inverse relationship between krill and copepod abundances thus occurred repeatedly and across a wide range of scales. The facts that krill swarms are mobile and were unrelated to hydrography further suggest that the inverse relationship was caused by krill. This could arise from competitive exclusion, direct predation or both. Evidence for competition is that South Georgia copepods rely on high phytoplankton biomass for recruitment and krill can remove this. Predation is suggested by the fact that crustaceans were found in krill guts in this region during both summer and winter. During the 1996 summer, experimentally derived predation rates on copepods, combined with krill biomass values, suggested a significant impact on small copepods. Therefore we suggest that copepod numbers can be controlled by a combination of competition and predation by krill.",2-s2.0-0033580049

Depending on their ecological niche and trophic position, zooplankton species at high latitudes have developed a variety of reproductive strategies and energetic adaptations to cope with these extreme environmental conditions. Life-cycle strategies of the herbivorous copepods and euphausiids, which make up the major portion of polar zooplankton biomass, include seasonal vertical migration, dormancy (diapause, quiescence) and the accumulation of energy reserves. These lipid stores help to buffer the pulsed seasonal food supply, and they play an important role in fueling reproduction independent of phytoplankton. Only a smaller fraction of the lipid reserves accumulated during spring and summer are usually catabolized for metabolic maintenance during the food-limited dark season. These deposits are retained until the end of winter and allow early egg production and spawning prior to—or coinciding with—the onset of vernal primary production. It enables the new generation to make full use of the short productive season for growth and development to reach viable overwintering stages. The Antarctic krill Euphausia superba is an exception since it uses its depot lipids for metabolic maintenance during the dark season. It therefore relies on external resources (Primary production) for reproductive processes, resulting in a later spawning period as compared to the other euphausiids. Another important component of the herbivorous Antarctic zooplankton, the salps, have developed a very different reproductive strategy. They are able to switch from sexual reproduction to asexual budding (metagenesis), which allows extreme multiplication rates under favourable feeding conditions. Due to these successful adaptations, herbivores are able to build up huge stocks, in spite of the short productive period. Omnivorous and carnivorous zooplankton species, e.g., amphipods or chaetognaths, are not much constrained by the seasonality problem, but experience a more constant food supply. They show a tendency towards K strategies with a prolonged reproductive period, reduced egg numbers and increasing parental care. However, they do not exhibit such typical “polar adaptations” as developed by the herbivorous species. © 1999 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",2-s2.0-0032875991

The females were also injected with tritiated water (HTO) to estimate food consumption, and non-instrumented females were stomach sampled upon return to the colony to determine their diet. The same data were collected in August/September from 3 males foraging after their 4 me prenuptial and incubation fast. Both females and males foraged in pack-ice within 120 km of the colony along a relatively narrow band of the continental shelf in water depths ranging from 200 to 500 m.

As day-length increased after winter, the penguins' daily swimming time increased from 7.83 ± 1.50 h in August to 12.23 ± 1.25 h in September and 12.95 ± 1.24 h in October. Accordingly, the penguins dive rate increased from 92.7 ± 28.5 to 149.4 ± 23.4 and 161.6 ± 19.3 dives d-1 in the respective months. The birds targeted prey in the vicinity of the continental slope mainly at depths &lt;100 m, although some individuals frequently hunted at depths &gt;200 m, and the maximum depth achieved was 438 m. Antarctic krill Euphausia superba were the most common prey taken overall, 41% of the diet by mass, and dominated the diets between August and October. The contribution of Antarctic krill to the diet reduced over time from 68% in August to 1% in early December. In November, the glacier squid Psychroteuthis glacialis dominated the diet (47 to 63%), and in early December the diet comprised various species of fish, Trematomus species (27%), Pagothenia borchgrevinki (24%), and Pleuragramma antarcticum (8%), and squid, P. glacialis (13%) and Alluroteuthis antarcticus (9%).

Our analysis of the relationship between annual sea-ice cover and a longer time series of air temperature measurements indicates a decreased frequency of winters with extensive sea-ice development over the last five decades.

The study was conducted between late May and early August, when male emperors remain at the colonies to incubate eggs and females forage at sea for self-maintenance. During winter, two satellite-tracked penguins from Auster foraged ≃100 km northeast of the colony in open Water 200-500 m deep, over the outer Continental shelf and shelf slope. Ten Auster and four Taylor Glacier penguins that carried time-depth recorders took ≃8 d to reach the ice edge, spent 50-60 d at sea foraging, and took 4 d to return across the fast ice to the colony. The females occasionally huddled together to minimize heat loss while in transit to the ice edge and between foraging days. The penguins foraged on 93.2% of their days at Sea and rested for the remainder. On each foraging day, penguins usually entered the water just after dawn and averaged 4.71 h in the water before exiting at dusk. The hourly dive rate was constant throughout winter, but the daily dive rate increased as day length increased, suggesting that day length is a primary determinant of hunting effort. Penguins exhibited behavior indicative of foraging on 47% of their dives, the remainder being travel or search dives. Penguins made, on average, 26 foraging dives/d. Females from Auster targeted prey at water depths of 20-70 m and 100-150 m, whereas Taylor Glacier birds targeted prey at 10-70 m, 250-300 m, and 330-400 m, suggesting between-colony differences in prey distribution. The stomach contents of 17 females returning to Auster to brood their chicks were dominated by pelagic prey species: Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba, 70% by mass) and Antarctic silverfish (Pleuragramma antarcticum, 13% by mass). Food consumption rates during winter for five penguins from both colonies were similar and averaged 62.6 ± 5.8 g·kg-1·d-1 (1.8± 0.1 kg/d for a 28.8 kg female), which equated to a metabolizable energy intake of 236.6 ± 22.0 kJ/kg for each day they foraged (all values are mean ± 1 SD). This enabled the birds to gain ≃6.1 kg for a trip spanning ≃70 d. Based on mean prey masses and the penguins' dive rates, the penguins consumed ≃115 X 0.6 g krill or 16 x 4.3 g Antarctic silverfish per foraging dive, or some combination of both.

Copepods and chaetognaths dominated numerically, while chaetognaths and krill Euphausia superba dominated in biomass wet weight. Salpa thompsoni occurred in low densities (median 0.1 to 0.4/1000 m3), although during the same period a mass development was recorded from the South Shetland Island region. Density values for Euphausia crystallorophias were in the same range as reported from the southern Weddell Sea. Krill, Euphausia superba, biomass was lower than generally found in the Antarctic Peninsula and Elephant Island region. A distinct spatial separation for size groups was observed for salps, Euphausia crystallorophias and krill. Small salp size groups dominated in the East Wind Drift zone and larger ones further north under the influence of West Wind Drift waters. Larger size classes of E. crystallorophias concentrated in nearshore areas. Krill was smaller in neritc and larger in oceanic waters. The overall krill length frequency distribution was similar to that reported from the South Shetland Island region for the same period. The recruitment index for E. crystallorophias and Thysanoessa macrura age group 1+ indicated a very successful year-class 1992/93 in the region (Ri = 0.412 and Ri = 0.609, respectively), while krill showed the opposite, a poor recruitment of the 1992/93 year class (Ri - 0.076). Spawning was late during the 1994 season for E. crystallorophias and E. superba; no larvae were found in the area. These findings are discussed in the light of recently described correlations between winter sea-ice conditions and krill spawning and recruitment success, and lead to the conclusion that recruitment of the 1993/94 krill year-class will be poor.",2-s2.0-0000511867

This study reports on the seasonal lipid dynamics of E. superba (25 to 56 mm) collected in the Weddell Sea in late winter/spring, summer, autumn and mid-winter. Total lipid data provide evidence of large seasonal accumulation of reserve lipids in austral summer with a mean lipid content of 28.2% of dry mass and particularly in autumn, when mean lipid levels peak with 39.2% of dry mass. After the overwintering period mean lipid contents decrease to a minimum of 10.5% of dry mass, indicating extensive utilisation of lipid reserves during winter. These data suggest that lipids contribute significantly to the overwintering success of this extremely versatile species. Lipid class analyses of spring and summer specimens (10 to 56 mm) from the Antarctic Peninsula and the Weddell Sea revealed that not only triacylglycerol, but also phosphatidylcholine may serve as important storage lipids of E. superba In the other dominant Antarctic krill species, E. crystallorophias (10 to 40 mm) and Thysanoessa macrura (10 to 27 mm), wax esters are the primary depot lipid, but phosphatidylcholine also functions as a storage lipid in these species. Phosphatidylcholine is unusual as a reserve lipid, being an essential component of biomembranes. In contrast, phosphatidylethanolamine, the other major phospholipid class, seems to have exclusively membrane functions, since it does not increase (in percent of dry mass) with increasing lipid levels in these 3 euphausiid species.",2-s2.0-0029668783

The mean time for E. crystallorophias eggs to develop to furcilia stage VI was 235.5 days, which is virtually identical to the developmental time already reported in the laboratory, but almost twice that of E. superba.

The vertical distribution and developmental stage composition of Rhincalanus gigas, Calanoides acutus, Calanus propinquus and krill, Euphausia superba larvae, were a good index for a general assessment of the seasonal condition of the plankton communities. There were five zones differing in seasonal situation: (1) The Polar Front and the southern ACC (not studied in detail). (2) The Weddell Front. (3) The Weddell Gyre interior, (4) The Maud Rise area, and (5) The Coastal Current zone. In the Weddell Front, the planktonic community resembled an autumnal situation with moderate phytoplankton biomass; the overwintering stock of copepods was not completely formed and the occurrence of calyptopes larvae of E. superba indicated that krill continued to reproduce until May. In the Weddell Gyre interior, a typical winter plankton community was found even before sea ice had formed. The specific hydrographic regime of the Maud Rise (governed by the mesoscale circulation over the seamount) support the late autumn conditions similar to the Weddell Front (but without early krill larvae). The plankton of the Coastal Current was a winter community. We conclude that in the eastern part of the Weddell Front (compared to the western part) seasonal development of both phytoplankton and herbivorous zooplankton is delayed in spring but prolonged in late autumn. Furthermore, it appears that the Weddell Sea ecosystem exhibits a much higher degree of spatial and temporal variability than thought before.

Recent studies have also demonstrated that is. superba individuals may be shrinking in the field during winter.

In this study, the correlation between the body-length and the crystalline cone number of the compound eye was examined. Samples collected in the late summer show an apparent linear relationship between crystalline cone number and body-length. From a laboratory population, it appears that when krill shrink the crystalline cone number remains relatively unchanged. If crystalline cone number is little affected by shrinking, then the crystalline cone number may be a more reliable indicator of age than body-length alone. The ratio of crystalline cone number to body-length offers a method for detecting the effect of shrinking in natural populations of krill.

Weight-specific excretion rates of freshly caught Euchaeta antarctica, Conchoecia sp., Thysanoessa macrura, Euphausia superba, and early stage copepodites of Metridia gerlachei were not significantly different from those reported in summer.

Theoretical estimates of target strength based on a straight cylinder model and applied to the numbers and sizes of euphausiids in net samples yielded estimates of mean volume backscattering strength (MVBS) that compared favorably with observed values at low abundances. However, net samples underestimated biomass by almost two orders of magnitude at high abundances, a feature we attribute to net avoidance.

Distributions of euphausiids were similar to those observed in summer; we found no evidence for abundant aggregations immediately below surface sea-ice. Euphausia superba dominated the biomass at all stations; individuals of approximately 22 mm were most abundant at 30-70 m depth, whereas 40-mm individuals were most abundant at 90-130 m. Thysanoessa macrura was positioned deeper in the water column, from 150 to 250 m, and Euphausia crystallorophias was centered on 100 m.

Euphausia superba occurs in large aggregations south of the Antarctic Convergence, living in extreme climatic conditions. In the Mediterranean Sea, populations of Meganyctiphanes norvegica experience moderate seasonal variations and a stable temperature regime (13 °C). Both species release their eggs in the water column and have similar basic patterns of development. The early seasonal development of the gonads of E. superba (especially ovarian previtellogenesis) is associated with the ice-edge in spring. Egg production is strictly limited to the summer (December, January and February), but multiple spawns are then produced by individual females through a succession of short vitellogenic cycles. Both males and females undergo a sexual regression in winter when only basic activity of the gonads (gametogenesis) is maintained. Ovarian development of M. norvegica starts in January (previtellogenesis) in the Ligurian Sea before the spring bloom. Eggs are produced from February to May by successive vitellogenic cycles. Gonadal activity is reduced during summer and autumn. This timing is different from the northern populations of the species that rather spawn in spring and summer. In both species the seasonal variability in food availability is tempered by storage of carbohydrates and lipids in the fat body for subsequent yolk accumulation in the eggs. These two krill species appear to have adapted their reproductive cycle to different habitats by using the flexibility of the physiological cycles involved in gonad development, a strategy that allows them to enhance fecundity and to tune the reproductive effort with food availability for the offspring. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",2-s2.0-0001686467

Two other seal species, the southern elephant seal (Mirounga leonina) and the fur seal (Arctocephalus gazella) (the only eared seal of this region) generally occur further to the north and use land rather than ice during the period of birth of young.

The behavioral and physiological characteristics that foster this success are: (1) the ability to find concentrations of food in several types of habitat and efficiently exploit whatever food is available; (2) the close correspondence of the life cycle with seasonal cycles of food availability; and (3) a combination of physiological mechanisms that enable krill to survive the long winter period of low food availability. We evaluated the relative importance of the following four major winter-over mechanisms that have been proposed for adult krill west of the Antarctic Peninsula. The three-fold reduction in metabolic rate is the most important winter-over mechanism for these adults, although lipid utilization and shrinkage also help satisfy energy requirements in the winter. Alternate food sources did not appear to contribute significantly as a winter energy source. However, the extent, predictability and complexity of the ice cover in a region during winter may have a great influence on the relative importance of these winter-over mechanisms for different populations. Ice cover in the waters west of the Antarctic Peninsula is unpredictable and smooth surfaced when it occurs, providing the krill with little refuge from predation. In multi-year pack ice of the Weddell Sea, however, ice cover is predictable and extensive, and there is a complex undersurface that provides hiding places. In this multi-year ice, adult krill have been observed under the ice feeding, whereas west of the Antarctic Peninsula most adult krill are in the water column in the winter and are not feeding. The balance between acquiring energy and avoiding predation may be different in these two regions in the winter because of differences in predictability and complexity of the ice cover. © 1991 by the American Society of Zoologists.",2-s2.0-77957217258

The aggregations of birds and mammals are expected to reflect aggregations of their principal food, krill (Euphausia superba) wintering underneath the ice cover. The distribution pattern of krill predators coincides with the course of a warm water belt upwelling near Maud Rise.

However, despite the short day length, several of the most common mesopelagic fish and crustaceans did migrate. Fish moved into shallower depths at night but apparently most did not continue into the near-freezing upper mixed layer, leaving that zone to the migratory crustaceans. In the upper 1000 m, the dominant species were, in order of decreasing biomass, Euphausia superba, the cnidarian Atolla wyvillei, the ctenophore Beroe sp., and the mesopelagic fish Electrona antarctica, Bathylagus antarcticus and Gymnoscopelus braueri.

Incidence of food in the stomachs in several important species was low, suggesting a low impact on their Zooplankton prey. Specimens of S. thompsoni had high quantities of food in their guts but this species was uncommon so its net impact would also have been low.

A total of 153 eggs from two species and 1368 larvae or juvenile stages from 12 species were obtained. These included pelagic species, and demersal species with a long pelagic larval or juvenile phase. Most abundant were larvae of Pleuragramma antarcticum and Notothenia kempi, and eggs of Notothenia neglecta. The distribution of notothenioid and paralepidid larvae was apparently unaffected by ice cover, whereas myctophid larvae were confined to ice-free waters. Areas where newly hatched Chionodraco hamatus occurred coincided with dense aggregations of Euphausia superba (Krill) furcilia larvae which is a potential food resource during winter. The hatching of icefish larvae during winter is apparently independent of the seasonal production cycle. Epipelagic eggs of Notothenia neglecta were found during the spawning season, which suggests that eggs ascend to the surface after demersal spawning and that development takes place near the sea surface during winter. Larvae of Notothenia kempi were chiefly confined to shelf and slope waters to the west of the Antarctic Peninsula, with larger larvae found in coastal shelf areas. Pleuragramma antarcticum occurred in the coastal waters off the Biscoe Islands, in the Gerlache Strait, and in the northern Bransfield Strait. The smallest larvae were found in the northern Bransfield Strait, whereas those at the Biscoe Islands and in Gerlache Strait waters were larger and of a similar size. A cyclonic gyre to the west of the Antarctic Peninsula observed in the austral summer was likely to have affected the larval drift of Pleuragramma antarcticum and Notothenia kempi. Differences in the timing of spawning and hatching and the vertical distribution of these larvae will lead to different transport and spatial distribution patterns. It is hypothesized that early winter conditions do not imply severe limitations on the year-class success of larval fish. Dispersal and increased mortality may occur during the second half of the winter. © 1991 Springer-Verlag.",2-s2.0-0000770434

Physical processes control the extent of ice cover, the magnitude and location of food, and the distribution of pack ice predators; however, physical processes did not appear to directly affect krill. Instead, the seasonal distribution and behavior of krill was interpreted to be a function of the need to acquire food and avoid predators. These two factors also are hypothesized to be the proximate cause of swarming. Seasonal sea ice plays an integral role in the ecology of krill. Ice-edge blooms are an important and predictable food supply, particularly for reproducing adults and first-feeding larvae. Ice floes provide protection for larvae and juveniles, and sea ice biota, a widespread food source, are important to the survival of larvae during winter. In the marginal ice zone, overwintering strategies of adults included regression to an immature (sub-adult) stage, reduction of metabolic rate, and omnivorous feeding in the water column. Adults were not observed feeding on the undersurface of ice floes probably because of increased risk of predation from pack ice predators, but adult krill may migrate deeper into the pack ice in winter and also feed on ice biota. Sea ice biota act as a stabilizing mechanism against extreme seasonal oscillations of food supply for overwintering krill, thus contributing to the persistence of krill populations. -from Authors",2-s2.0-0026394971

The first critical period occurs during development of the non-feeding stages. Release of embryos over warm deep water (250-400 m) is advantageous for these early larval stages. The geographical distribution of spawning populations combined with the observed pattern in sinking rates of embryos during development form a reproductive strategy that maximises survival of the early non-feeding stages. The first winter is the second critical period. Physiological condition of larvae and juveniles is an index of their nutritional history and ability to survive and enter the adult population the following summer. Significant differences were found in the physiological condition of larvae collected during two winters which differed primarily in the degree of ice cover.

This paper uses Principal Components Analysis to elucidate the mesoscale features of zooplankton distribution within the two survey grids. During both surveys the major contrast was between the plankton of the shelf and the surrounding ocean. However, within the oceanic part of each grid, localized areas of warmer water were inhabited by a fauna characteristics of warmer latitudes to the north. The biological and oceanographic evidence suggests that areas represents core rings or similar intrusions from north of the Polar Front. Not all of the characteristic warm- and cold-water species showed a clear correlation with water origin. For example, the swarming behaviour of Euphausia superba limited its usefulness as a mesoscale tracer. Likewise, the distribution of the Antarctic copepod Calanoides acutus was poorly related to water temperature during the summer survey because the timing of sampling coincided with its annual spawning cycle. Large-scale movement of oceanic fronts has already been identified as being important in dictating overall species composition around the island, but at a smaller scale these intrusions of warmer water may be an important intermediary mechanism of community advection into the area. © 1990.",2-s2.0-0025632374

Amounts of krill washed onto the ice during ice-breaking along transects were noted. Juvenile and sub-adult krill were found, often in high numbers, in association with seasonal pack-ice, from the outer marginal ice zone to at least 200 nautical miles [3 50 km] into the closed pack-ice zone. Krill caught with the RMT or observed within or close to the ice usually had full guts. They were frequently seen feeding on ice algae, and seemed to concentrate in pressure zones, melting ice and infiltration layers, ie where ice provided both confining crevices and rich algal growth. During twilight numbers of krill increased in open water close to the ice, though ROV observations at night revealed even greater numbers remaining in ice cavities. Direct observations from deck, by divers and by ROV, confirmed that most of the krill population in the uppermost water layer was confined to ice habitats, though in three out of 20 RMT catches krill reached densities of 0.1 m3 ie normal summer values. ‘Miniswarms’ forming in early November may indicate seasonal transition of at least part of the krill population from winter ice habitat and grazing on ice-algae, to summer pelagic life and filter-feeding on phytoplankton. © 1990, Cambridge University Press.

Chrysophyte cysts (archaeomonads) of unknown affinity and dinoflagellate cysts are abundant and may serve as overwintering stages in ice. The ice fauna includes a variety of heterotrophic flagellates, ciliates, and micrometazoa. The abundance of heterotrophs indicates an active food web within the ice community. Ice may serve as a temporary habitat or refuge for many of the microbial forms and some of these appear to provide an inoculum for planktonic populations when ice melts.

In Euphausia superba, shortly before moult the activity increased in chitinase and N-acetyl-β-D-glucosaminidase to pronounced maxima indicating the onset of massive resorption of cuticular material. Enzymatic activity of E. superba corresponded to values in Meganyctiphanes norvegica, a boreal euphausiid which was investigated for comparison, as well as in insecta. Antarctic krill from winter catches displayed activities comparable to summer material suggesting physiological preparation for moulting. Accordingly, moulting did not cease during winter. Both enzymes were also active in the digestive tract in summer as well as in winter krill: chitin containing food of phyto-and zooplankton origin is digestable. Seasonally stable activities did not point to changes in nutritional preference. In contrast to other crustacea, digestive enzyme activity was not reduced around moult, suggesting a high capacity to continuously utilize food sources including chitin. This property can be linked directly to the high energy need caused by the necessity of constant active swimming in both krill species. © 1989 Springer-Verlag.",2-s2.0-0000707780

The diets of 40 species of zooplankton and micronekton occurring in the epipelagic zone were examined and compared using non-hierarchical clustering procedures. Over half the species were in three clusters of predominantly small-particle (phytoplankton; protozoans) grazers. These included biomass dominants Calanoides acutus, Calanus propinquus, Metridia gerlachei and Salpa thompsoni. Six clusters contained omnivores that had diets consisting of small particles as well as a substantial fraction of metozoan food. Among these was Euphausia superba. Seven groups were carnivorous, including species of copepods (1), chaetognaths (3), and fishes (5). Copepods were the most frequent food of carnivores; however krill also were important in the diets of three fish species. Among small-particle grazers, phytoplankton occurred more frequently in guts of individuals from open water; carnivory was more in evidence in samples collected under the pack ice. Regional comparisons of material taken on this and several previous cruises indicate that, in most of the dominant species, diets remain relatively consistent with respect to major food categories. Seasonal impact on feeding dynamics appears to be great: the guts of grazing species were generally much more full (visual evidence) during summer bloom conditions than during the autumn. The following trophic sequence is suggested for grazing zooplankton species in ice-covered regions of the Antarctic: (1) Active small-particle grazing during the summer bloom period; (2) reduced ingestion rates in autumn as primary production declines and the system becomes more oligotrophic, with some species augmenting grazing with carnivory; (3) descent of zooplankton biomass species into the mesopelagic zone in late autumn-early winter with feeding largely terminated. The sequence applies to the dominant zooplankton biomass species. Feeding dynamics and vertical distribution of several of the important larger sized grazing species, such as Euphausia superba and Salpa thompsoni, remain largely unknown. © 1989.",2-s2.0-0024921117

Results presented here, show that known aspects of krill morphology and behavior are actually adaptations to the ice habitat, suggesting that the dominance of krill in the Antarctic marine ecosystem is a result of its capacity to grow and reproduce in the water column in summer, and find both food and shelter in the ice cover during the rest of the year.

This initial paper compares zooplankton biomass, vertical distribution and species composition from RMT 1 catches in the oceanic portion of the grid (water depth greater than 2000 m) during the two surveys. In the winter survey, mean zooplankton biomass within the top 1000 m of the water column was 68% of its summer level. This drop was largely due to a decrease in abundance of krill (Euphausia superba), although biomass of copepods and remaining zooplankton also decreased. Copepods averaged 48% of total biomass in summer and winter, but outnumbered all other taxa put together by a factor of 10. Antarctic epipelagic species predominated around the island in the summer survey but tended to be replaced by sub-Antarctic or cosmopolitan species during the winter survey. The majority of zooplankton also showed a downwards seasonal migration out of the top 250 m layer in winter. However, several epipelagic species, including E. superba, did not migrate, and these tended to have the largest summer-winter differences in overall abundance. These trends were attributed to variation in the position of the Polar Front, which lay north of the island during the summer survey but lay across the survey area in winter, resulting in a greater influence of sub-Antarctic water and the displacement of Antarctic species. © 1988 Springer-Verlag.",2-s2.0-0001446033

Copepod concentration, copepod size, phytoplankton concentration, the duration of krill starvation and the volume of experimental vessels were altered to determine effects on ingestion and clearance rates. Krill allowed to feed on phytoplankton and copepods in 50-litre tubs showed greatly increased feeding rates relative to animals feeding in the much smaller volumes of water traditionally used for krill-feeding studies. Clearance rates on copepods remained constant over the range of concentrations offered, but clearance rates on phytoplankton increased linearly with phytoplankton concentration. Feeding rates increased when larger copepods were offered and when krill were starved for two weeks prior to experiments. Clearance rates of krill feeding on copepods were higher than, but not correlated with, their clearance rates on phytoplankton in the same vessel. E. superba may have a distinct mechanism for capturing copepods, perhaps through mechanoreception. Although our observed clearance rate of 1055 ml krill-1 h-1 indicates that krill can feed very efficiently on copepod prey, such feeding would meet less than 10% of their minimum metabolic requirements at the ""typical"" copepod concentrations reported for Antarctic waters. However, substantial energy could be gained if krill fed on the patches of high copepod concentrations occasionally reported during the austral summer, or if krill and copepods were concentrated beneath the sea ice during the winter or spring months. Our results, indicating efficient feeding on zooplankton and higher clearance rates on phytoplankton than previously believed, represent a step towards balancing the energy budget of E. superba in Antarctic waters. © 1988 Springer-Verlag.",2-s2.0-34250085566

Growth rates calculated using the ELEFAN computer program yielded values comparable with laboratory rates, but gave slow positive growth rather than negative or zero growth during winter. Seasonal growth rates closely followed water column pigment concentration, and indicated that both krill age class and food concentration should be included in models of krill growth. Growth rate of Group 0, I and II age classes was a hyperbolic function of food concentration. Maximum growth rates varied with age class and occurred only at concentrations greater than about 50 μg Chl a m-2. Age class specific thresholds for zero growth occurred at water column concentrations of 9.2-17.5 μg Chl a m-2 or 0.06-0.1 μg Chl a l-1 with homogeneous pigment concentration. Negative growth is expected at concentrations below these thresholds. The analysis demonstrates that krill growth was food limited for six months of the year, but also shows that krill can often meet their minimum requirements for growth at the low concentrations of phytoplankton characterizing offshore Southern Ocean waters. © 1988.",2-s2.0-0024258027

The most numerous species (&gt;1000/100 m3) were the copepods Metridia gerlachei, Microcalanus pygmaeus, Oncaea antarctica and Oncaea curvata. Oncaea curvata alone constituted half the zooplakton population. Zooplankton biomass was dominated by three copepod species, Metridia gerlachei, Calanoides aculus and Euchaeta antarctica,which comprised 74% of the biomass. Size analysis revealed most of the zooplankton numbers were in the &gt;1 mm fraction. The biomass distribution was polymodal with major maxima in the &gt;1 mm and the 4-4.9 mm size classe. The &gt;1 mm peak, exclusive of protozoans, was primarily copepod nauplii and copepodites of Oncaea, Metridia and Microcalanus. The 4-4.9 mm peak was mostly Calanoides acutus and Metridia gerlachei.

There was some suggestion of diel vertial migration by Metridia gerlachei and Euchaeta antarctica, with segments of their populations migrating into the upper 100 m and 200 m, respectively, at night. Most of the dominant and subdominant species were concentrated below 200 m,with only the subdominant Oithona similis having its maximum in the epipelagic zone.

The greatest increase in BL over a series of 4-5 moults ranged from 0.024 to 0.070 mm/day, which is equivalent to 0.0020 to 0.0086/day in body weight, assuming exponential growth. This maximum growth rate is about half the rate predicted from the growth scheme of Mauchline (1980) for wild krill. Comparison of growth data for other euphausiids suggests that Mauchline's scheme produces anomalous growth rate. The slower growth rate observed in the present study would extend the estimated life span of krill from 3-4 years, as calculated by Mauchline (1980), to 4-7 years. If krill undergo body shrinkage during the Antarctic winter the estimated life span might be even longer. Examination of the external sexual characters of moults showed both progression and regression of maturity stage in association with changes in BL. © 1985 Springer-Verlag.",2-s2.0-0003154869

The decline could not be attributed to any of the environmental factors investigated, including phytoplankton biomass which was higher than expected. One effect of the reduced krill population, observed during the 1983 to 1984 summer, was a much lower than average breeding success for bird and seal predators of krill on Bird Island, South Georgia. Historical evidence suggests that drastic reductions in krill abundance may not be uncommon, and will have profound consequences for the developing krill fishery. © 1985.",2-s2.0-0022183460

Knowledge of energy flow between Antarctic krill Euphausia superba and the higher predators is better. Little is known about the role of dissolved or particulate organic carbon, or of fluxes to the benthic community. Winter metabolic rates are very low, hence there is no need for the large lipid stores so characteristic of the plankton.

A significant reduction in body size (32.1-56.1% of initial wet wt) was observed. Compared with wild animals starved E. superba decreased their oxygen uptake, ammonia excretion and phosphate excretion considerably (24-52%), but no significant changes in wet: dry wt ratio, and chemical compositions (C, N, P) were observed. The mortality of the starved group was similar to that of controls fed Tetra Marin and frozen copepods and less than that of controls fed a mixture of microalgae (Dunaliella and Phaeodactylum). Because of insufficient lipid storage, E. superba is hypothesized to switch from herbivorous feeding to omnivorous or carnivorous during the Antarctic winter. The present results suggest, however, that body shrinkage could be an alternative way for this animal to conserve energy during the winter. The advantage of this is discussed in the light of the characteristics of body structure and life style of E. superba. © 1982.",2-s2.0-0000382649

The principal methods of investigation are (a) anatomical examination, (b) observations at sea, (c) the marking of whales, (d) analysis of the statistics of the whaling industry, (a) The whalebone whales are migratory animals, inhabiting high latitudes in summer where food is plentiful, and moving into warmer waters in winter where there is little or no food, but where breeding takes place. The Greenland right whale does not move far from the Arctic regions and is not found in the southern hemisphere. The black right whales of the north and south do not migrate far and are separated by a wide tropical belt. The humpback migrates from the polar ice to the equator, and frequents tropical coastal waters in the winter months. In the southern hemisphere it is segregated into several communities which have separate migration routes, and between which there can be little interchange. Blue and fin whales undertake less regular and extensive migrations. They are not segregated like the humpbacks, but show a slight tendency to concentrate in the same regions. Grey whales inhabit the North Pacific and undertake regular migrations along the coasts of North America and in Japanese waters. There is less information on the distribution of the sei, lesser rorqual, pigmy right, and Bryde's whale. (3).Certain planktonic Crustacea form the principal food of the whalebone whales. In the Antarctic they feed virtually exclusively on the shoals of Euphausia superba. In the northern seas the diet seems to be more varied. Meganyctiphanes norvegica is probably the most important food organism in the North Atlantic, but further investigations are needed. Little food is taken in winter, though fish and small quantities of other Crustacea are sometimes eaten. (4) Examination of the reproductive organs and measurements of foetuses at different times of year show that breeding mainly takes place in winter and that the period of gestation is about a year. Normally one young is born at a time, and the usual interval between successive pregnancies is probably two years. This applies to blue and fin whales, but other species are probably similar. Blue and fin whales are believed to become sexually mature in about two or three years. The old corpora lutea of the ovaries persist and accumulate, and constitute the best indication so far found of the age of an adult whale. There is some evidence that the rate of increment is about one per year, but this again needs confirmation. The largest recorded number is fifty‐four. Indications of periodic growth in the baleen plates constitute a new method of determining the ages of young whales. The rate of growth is faster in the anterior than in the posterior part of the body. (5) Whalebone whales are more plentiful in the southern than in the northern hemisphere. The sexes are nearly equal. The existing ratio of blue, fin and humpback whales is estimated to be of the order of 15, 75 and 10 respectively in the Southern Ocean, but no estimate has yet been made of the absolute numbers in the populations. Most whaling is carried out by the Antarctic pelagic factories, and little is done now in the northern hemisphere. The stocks of blue and humpback whales have been depleted by the modern industry, but fin whales have been less affected, and progress has been made in the international regulation of whaling. (6) In the future it will be necessary to continue research to some extent on the same lines as before, but new or modified methods could be developed, and aircraft and modern technical devices might be used with advantage.
