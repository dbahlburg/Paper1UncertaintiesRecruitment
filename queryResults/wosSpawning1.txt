J	SIEGEL, V; LOEB, V				SIEGEL, V; LOEB, V			RECRUITMENT OF ANTARCTIC KRILL EUPHAUSIA-SUPERBA AND POSSIBLE CAUSES FOR ITS VARIABILITY	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												Between-year variability of krill Euphausia superba year class success and recruitment during the 1977 to 1994 period are described based on data from German expeditions and U.S. Antarctic Marine Living Resources Program cruises in the Elephant Island area. The recruitment index (R(1)), based on the relative abundance of the 1+ age class, varies substantially between years, whereas it is quite similar between different surveys within the same field season. The overall mean recruitment index for all years was R(mean) = 0.210. Good recruitment was observed for the 1980/81, 1985/86, 1987/88, and 1990/91 year classes; exceedingly poor recruitment occurred for the 1976/77, 1982/83, 1983/84, 1988/89, 1991/92 and 1992/93 year classes. Pairwise correlations between the stock parameters, recruitment indices, and available environmental data indicate that good and poor year class success are directly and indirectly related to sea ice conditions during the preceding winter season, the timing of krill spawning, and the occurrence of dense salp concentrations. No correlation is shown with upper water column temperature or krill stock/spawning stock size. A concept is developed describing the interactions of various parameters leading to good or poor krill recruitment.																	0171-8630					JUL	1995	123	1-3					45	56		10.3354/meps123045							WOS:A1995RQ34100006						
J	Fach, BA; Hofmann, EE; Murphy, EJ				Fach, BA; Hofmann, EE; Murphy, EJ			Modeling studies of antarctic krill Euphausia superba survival during transport across the Scotia Sea	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												Antarctic krill Euphausia superba spawned on the outer continental shelf of the west Antarctic Peninsula can be entrained into the Southern Front of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current and transported across the Scotia Sea to South Georgia. A time-dependent, size-structured, physiologically based krill growth model was used to assess the food resources that are needed to sustain Antarctic krill during transport across the Scotia Sea and to allow them to grow to a size observed at South Georgia. Initial Lagrangian simulations provide trajectories that are followed by particles released on the west Antarctic Peninsula shelf. Pelagic phytoplankton concentrations along these trajectories are extracted from historical Coastal Zone Color Scanner measurements from the Antarctic Peninsula-Scotia Sea region and are input to the growth model. The results of these simulations show that pelagic phytoplankton concentrations are not sufficient to support continuous growth of Antarctic krill during the 140 to 160 d needed for transport to South Georgia. The inclusion of a supplemental food source during part of the transport time, such as sea ice algae (up to 80 mg chl a m(-3)), does not significantly alter this result. Survival and growth of larval krill during modeled transport is, however, enhanced by encounters with mesoscale patches of high chlorophyll concentrations (1 mg m(-3)), while subadults and adults benefit less from these conditions. Further simulations show the importance of an additional food source, such as heterotrophic food, for the survival of subadult and adult Antarctic krill. For all planktonic food scenarios tested, krill that begin transport at the Antarctic Peninsula did not reach the smallest age group often observed at South Georgia, the 2+ group, during the 140 to 160 d of transport. Including the effect of increasing temperature across the Scotia Sea on krill growth rate does not significantly alter these results, since the maximum increase in growth due to increased temperature obtained in the simulations was 1.0 mm for both 2 and 22 mm Antarcic krill. These simulations suggest the possibility of alternative transport scenarios, such as Antarctic krill beginning transport at the Antarctic Peninsula in austral summer and overwintering under the sea ice that extends northward from the Weddell Sea into the Scotia Sea. Such an interrupted transport would allow the Antarctic krill to overwinter in a potentially better food environment and begin transport again the following year, growing to a size that is within the range observed for Antarctic krill populations at South Georgia.

J	Jager, T; Ravagnan, E				Jager, Tjalling; Ravagnan, Elisa			Parameterising a generic model for the dynamic energy budget of Antarctic krill Euphausia superba	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												Dynamic Energy Budget (DEB) theory is a generic and comprehensive framework for understanding bioenergetics over the entire life cycle of an organism. Here, we apply a simplified model derived from this theory (DEBkiss) to Antarctic krill Euphausia superba. The model was parameterised using growth curves, and conversion factors for body composition and length-weight relationships. Subsequently, the model was used to predict a series of life-history traits (as function of body size) that were not used for parameterisation: instantaneous growth rates, ingestion and respiration rates, weight loss on starvation, and the number of eggs produced at spawning. Within the DEB framework, these traits are not intrinsic properties of the organism, but tightly coupled model outputs that depend on body size, life stage, and environmental conditions. Overall, the model predictions are consistent with the patterns in the (rather uncertain) observations, lending credence to the model assumptions underlying the DEBkiss model. More work is needed to fully elucidate the bioenergetics of the E. superba life cycle, but this analysis demonstrates how a dynamic budgeting framework can ensure consistency among the different life-history traits. Thereby, such models help in the interpretation of experimental results and the comparison of species, but can also form the basis for predicting population dynamics and the impacts of stressors.

Demographic and maturity patterns of Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) in an overwintering hotspot	POLAR BIOLOGY												Overwinter environmental conditions are a major driver of larval survival, recruitment, and reproductive pre-conditioning in Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba). Few winter studies exist from which to infer impacts of changing environmental conditions on the biology of krill. Here demographic and maturity patterns of krill during five winters are examined at an overwintering hotspot in the northern Antarctic Peninsula. Two different recruitment pulses were present over the 5 years of the study. A large recruitment event was evident in winter 2012, followed by cohort growth tracked through winter 2014. A recruitment event also occurred in 2015, despite lower abundance of larvae in 2013 and 2014. The recruitment pulse in 2015 was correlated with the intrusion of high salinity water, characteristic of the Weddell Sea, during a positive El Nino-Southern Oscillation phase, suggesting recruitment was driven by advection of recruits into the northern Antarctic Peninsula. Despite the inter-annual environmental variability, most female krill were in resting reproductive stages in all years. The lack of variability in female reproductive status during winter may impose a developmental constraint to earlier spawning than previously considered; the time necessary to advance from resting stages to reproductive maturity may limit the ability of krill to adapt to trends in the timing and magnitude of the spring bloom. The observed patterns of recruitment and variation in maturity stages highlight the complexity of krill population dynamics and should be considered when projecting population responses of Antarctic krill to climate-driven changes in the Southern Ocean.				, Jefferson/AAG-1702-2021	, Jefferson/0000-0002-3600-1414												0722-4060	1432-2056				SEP	2020	43	9					1233	1245		10.1007/s00300-020-02704-4		AUG 2020					WOS:000557139900001

Fecundity estimates were determined based on counts of mature oocytes in the ovary of females in preserved field samples. Principal components analysis and allometry were used to analyze the covariation of egg-batch size with female characteristics. In both krill species, egg-batch size scaled isometrically with ovarian weight but showed a positive allometry with body size. Predicted egg-batch size ranged from 200 to 4000 eggs for M. norvegica of 25.5-35 mm body length and from 1500 to 6000 eggs for E. superba of 36-55 mm. Allometric relationships can be used to predict annual fecundity from size structure data of krill populations. In this study, the effect of temperature on the duration of molting and spawning cycles was used to infer a number of reproductive cycles per year. taking into account climate and seasonal variation.																	0706-652X						2000	57			3			6	15		10.1139/cjfas-57-S3-6							WOS:000166531600002

Euphausia superba occurs in large aggregations south of the Antarctic Convergence, living in extreme climatic conditions. In the Mediterranean Sea, populations of Meganyctiphanes norvegica experience moderate seasonal variations and a stable temperature regime (13-degrees-C). Both species release their eggs in the water column and have similar basic patterns of development. The early seasonal development of the gonads of E. superba (especially ovarian previtellogenesis) is associated with the ice-edge in spring. Egg production is strictly limited to the summer (December, January and February), but multiple spawns are then produced by individual females through a succession of short vitellogenic cycles. Both males and females undergo a sexual regression in winter when only basic activity of the gonads (gametogenesis) is maintained. Ovarian development of M. norvegica starts in January (previtellogenesis) in the Ligurian Sea before the spring bloom. Eggs are produced from February to May by successive vitellogenic cycles. Gonadal activity is reduced during summer and autumn. This timing is different from the northern populations of the species that rather spawn in spring and summer. In both species the seasonal variability in food availability is tempered by storage of carbohydrates and lipids in the fat body for subsequent yolk accumulation in the eggs. These two krill species appear to have adapted their reproductive cycle to different habitats by using the flexibility of the physiological cycles involved in gonad development, a strategy that allows them to enhance fecundity and to tune the reproductive effort with food availability for the offspring.																	0168-8170					AUG	1993	23	2-3					105	114		10.1080/07924259.1993.9672301							WOS:A1993MA13300004						
J	Fach, BA; Hofmann, EE; Murphy, EJ				Fach, Bettina A.; Hofmann, Eileen E.; Murphy, Eugene J.			Transport of Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) across the Scotia Sea. Part II. Krill growth and survival	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART I-OCEANOGRAPHIC RESEARCH PAPERS												A time-dependent, size-structured, physiologically based krill growth model was used in conjunction with a circulation model to test the hypothesis that Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) populations at South Georgia are sustained by import of individuals from upstream regions. Surface phytoplankton concentrations along the simulated drifter trajectories were extracted from historical Coastal Zone Color Scanner (CZCS) measurements and sea ice biota concentrations were calculated from sea ice concentration and extent extracted along drifter trajectories from Special Sensor Microwave/Imager measurements. As additional food sources, a time series of heterotrophic food was constructed from historical data, and time series of detritus concentrations were calculated using phytoplankton concentrations extracied from CZCS measurements together with measured particulate organic carbon to chlorophyll a ratios. These food resources along specified drifter trajectories were then input to the krill growth model to determine the size and viability of krill during transport from the source region to South Georgia. The krill growth model simulations showed that no single food source can support continuous growth of krill during the 58-306 days needed for transport to South Georgia. However, under the current assumptions results indicate that combinations of food sources during the transport time enhanced krill survival, with heterotrophic food and detritus being particularly important during periods of low phytoplankton concentrations. The growth model simulations also showed that larval and juvenile krill originating along the western Antarctic Peninsula can grow to 1+ (14-36mm) and 2+ (26-45 mm) age and size classes observed at South Georgia during the time needed for transport to this region. Krill originating in the Weddell Sea need 20 months for transport, which allows retention in a potentially high food environment, provided by sea ice, for almost 1 year. Krill then complete transport to South Georgia in the following year and larval and juvenile krill grow to 2+ (26-45 mm) and 3+ (35-60 mm) age and size classes during transport. The results of this study show that the successful transport of krill to South Georgia depends on a multitude of factors, such as the location of the spawning area and timing of spawning, food concentrations during transport, predation, and variations in the location of the Southern Antarctic Circumpolar Current Front (SACCF) and in sea ice extent.

The effects of variability in Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) spawning behavior and sex/maturity stage distribution on Adelie penguin (Pygoscelis adeliae) chick growth: A modeling study	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY												Factors that control variability in energy density of Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) populations, and the consequences of this variability for growth and fledging mass of Adelie penguin (Pygoscelis adeliae) chicks, were investigated using an individual-based energetics model. Lipid content as a function of sex/maturity stage and season was used to calculate the energy density of krill ingested by chicks. Simulations tested the influence of variability in krill size-class distribution, sex-ratio, length-at-maturity, and the timing of spawning on krill population energy density and penguin chick fledging mass. Of the parameters included in simulations, variability in the timing of krill spawning had the greatest influence on predicted Adelie penguin fledging mass, with fledging mass decreasing from 3.30 to 2.92 kg when peak spawning was shifted from early December to early March. Adelie penguin chicks that fledge from colonies along the western Antarctic Peninsula (wAP) and survive to recruit into the breeding population are 0.117 kg heavier than those that do not survive to breed. Thus, it appears that small differences in fledging mass potentially have significant implications for Adelie penguin chick survivorship. Therefore, the timing of krill spawning may have important consequences for Adelie penguins, and other top-predator species, that may time critical activities to coincide with a period of dependable prey availability with maximum energy density.

The life span of E. superba exceeded 5 yr in the Cosmonaut Sea and 6 yr in the Cooperation Sea. Assuming growth for only 180 d per year, growth rates ranged from 0.120-0.133 mm d(-1) during the first year of life to 0.019-0.022 mm d(-1) during the fifth year.

The coefficients of natural mortality (M) of E. superba in the Indian sector of the Southern Ocean, calculated by the methods of Alverson & Carney, Richter and Efanov and Beverton and Holt, varied from 0.72 to 0.87, from 0.52 to 0.57 and from 0.76 to 2.92, respectively. The value of age-dependent natural mortality of E. superba derived using Zikov and Slepokurov's method ranged from 0.52 during the maturation period to 1.1-2.41 during the first and last years of life. Based on long-term observations, the relationship between E. superba age composition and its spawning success is examined for the coastal areas of the Cooperation and Cosmonaut Seas.																	0171-8630					MAR	1995	119	1-3					45	61		10.3354/meps119045							WOS:A1995QR92700005

Population genetic variation of the Southern Ocean krill, Euphausia superba, in the Western Antarctic Peninsula region based on mitochondrial single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY												The Southern Ocean krill, Euphausia superba, is one of the best-studied marine zooplankton species in terms of population genetic diversity and structure; with few exceptions, previous studies have shown the species to be genetically homogeneous at larger spatial scales. The goals of this study are to examine sub-regional scale population genetic diversity and structure of E. superba using molecular characters selected with this goal in mind, and to thereby examine hypotheses of the source(s) of recruitment for krill populations of the Western Antarctic Peninsula (WAP). Collections were made throughout the WAP region during US GLOBEC cruises in austral fall, 2001 and 2002. A total of 585 E. superba (including all 6 furcilia larval stages, juveniles, and adults) was analyzed after confirmation of species identification using a competitive multiplexed species-specific PCR (SS-PCR) reaction based on mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I (mtCOI) sequences. The molecular markers used were allele frequencies at single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) sites in the gene encoding mitochondria! Cytochrome b (cyt 6). Four SNP sites that showed desirable patterns of allelic variation were selected; alleles were detected using a multiplexed single-base extension PCR protocol. A total of 22 SNP haplotypes (i.e., strings of polymorphisms at the four SNP sites) was observed; haplotype diversity (Hd)=0.811 (s.d.=0.008). Analysis of molecular variation within and among samples, areas (i.e., Marguerite Bay, Crystal Sound, shelf, and offshore) and collection years revealed no difference between 2001 and 2002 collections overall, although differences between 2001 and 2002 collections from Marguerite Bay explained 7.4% of the variance (F-ST=0.072; p=0.002 +/- 0.001). Most of the variation (96.3%) occurred within samples each year, with no significant differentiation among areas. There was small, but significant differentiation among samples within areas in 2001 (4.6%; F-ST=0.045; p=0.015 +/- 0.003) and 2002 (6.3%; F-ST=0.062; p=0.000 +/- 0.000). There was evidence of life stage-specific spatial differentiation for furcilia in 2002 for F1 (18.1%, p=0.000 +/- 0.000) and F2 (9.2%, p=0.001 +/- 0.001). The significant differentiation among samples for E. superba within areas was interpreted as evidence of multiple sources of recruitment of E. superba in the WAP region, consistent with advective transport in observed circulation patterns and reproduction and spawning in both offshore and shelf habitats. Further population genetic analysis at sub-regional scales is needed to understand and eventually predict population dynamic processes (e.g., recruitment, migration, retention, and over-wintering) of Southern Ocean krill.

Two survey areas were sampled focussed on Marguerite Bay in the south, and the tip of the Antarctic Peninsula in the north. Data from 177 stations showed that the highest concentrations of krill were found in the southern sampling area. Differences between areas were associated with a few large catches of one year old krill found in anomalously warm and productive waters in Marguerite Bay, and small krill catches in the less-productive, offshore waters in the north. Estimated krill density across the survey area was 3.4 krill m(-2), and was low compared to the long-term average of 45 krill m(-2) for the Elephant Island area. Overall recruitment between the two survey regions was similar, but per capita recruitment was about 60% lower than historical mean recruitment levels measured at Elephant Island since the late 1970s. Demographic patterns showed small krill concentrated near the coast, and large krill concentrated offshore on the shelf and slope all along the survey area. The offshore distribution of adult krill was delineated by the warm (similar to 1 degrees C), low salinity (33.8) water at 30 m, suggesting that most krill were present shoreward of the southern boundary of Antarctic Circumpolar Current Front. Distributions of larvae indicated that three hotspot areas were important for the production of krill: slope areas outside Marguerite Bay and north of the South Shetland Islands, and near the coast around Antarctic Sound. Successful spawning, as inferred from larval abundance, was roughly coincident with the shelf break and not with inshore waters. Given the rapid changes in climate along the Antarctic Peninsula and the lower per capita recruitment observed in recent years, studies comparing and contrasting production, growth, and recruitment across the Peninsula will be critical to better understand how climate change will impact krill populations and their dependent predators in the Scotia Sea.

Egg-release behaviour in Antarctic krill	POLAR BIOLOGY												The process of egg release is a complex and crucial step in the life cycle of euphausiids, especially with regards mortality and recruitment success. We examined this process in Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) in terms of the functioning of the female genital apparatus and associated swimming behaviour. A tethering technique combined with video analysis was used to make observations of three females during the release process. We found eggs were steadily extruded over a period of up to 10 h, during which time the krill released between 1,600 and 4,000 eggs and the ovary reduced by a half in length and a third in height. Eggs were mainly released individually or, less commonly, in batches of between 2 and 4 eggs. Release rates were between 5 and 30 eggs min(-1). The steady release of eggs fits well with histological evidence that mature oocytes must pass individually through tight genital ducts with narrow apertures, before coming in to close contact with the sperm plug for fertilisation, and then expulsion from the thelycum as fertilised eggs. During spawning, the female alternated between slow and rapid rates of pleopod beating with egg release occurring at the moment of beat acceleration. At the point of release, the descent of the egg was accelerated through downward beats of the 7th thoracic leg. The cyclic pattern in pleopod beat-rate during spawning may alter swimming performance and contribute to the widely reported sex- and maturity-based biases within krill swarms.

S	Kawaguchi, S		Siegel, V		Kawaguchi, So			Reproduction and Larval Development in Antarctic Krill (Euphausia superba)	BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY OF ANTARCTIC KRILL	Advances in Polar Ecology											An understanding of the reproduction and larval development of Antarctic krill is important since reproductive output is a key factor influencing their overall population size. Seasonal cycles of maturity in krill are known to be finely synchronized with seasonal cycles of food, sea-ice and the light regime in the Antarctic environment. This chapter will describe the progression of Antarctic krill development throughout their life cycle, including their maturation process, fecundity, spawning, and larval development, in relation to various environmental factors that are thought to govern these processes. The chapter will close with some remarks on possible effects of climate change on krill life history.

Environmental drivers of the physiological condition of mature female Antarctic krill during the spawning season: implications for krill recruitment	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												Southern Ocean pelagic productivity relies on the abundance of Antarctic krill Euphausia superba, which fluctuates on a 5-7 yr cycle and is driven by interannual variability in recruitment. The western Antarctic Peninsula (wAP) is home to a significant proportion of the circum-Antarctic krill biomass and is the focus of the krill fishery. The wAP is warming at a rate quicker than most other places on Earth, with notable regional changes in the pelagic ecosystem. There is a major gap in our understanding of how environmental variability affects the reproductive success of krill. We used historical krill population data collected at the wAP (January 1993-2008, Palmer Antarctica Long Term Ecological Research) to assess the effects of environmental variability on the condition of mature female krill during the spawning season and its relationship with krill recruitment. Mature female krill condition during the spawning season was positively correlated with recruitment the subsequent year. Results of generalized additive models indicated that the predominant drivers of krill condition during the spawning season were climatological (Southern Annular Mode and Multivariate El Nino Southern Oscillation Index), though the timing of sea ice advance and retreat, and diatom concentrations were also important Gaining a better understanding of the oceanographic and climatological factors that affect the physiological condition of mature female krill is critical for predicting future demographic patterns and responses to change. Results from our study emphasize the importance of including the effects of climate change in the management models for the Antarctic krill fishery.																	0171-8630	1616-1599				JUL 8	2021	669						65	82		10.3354/meps13720							WOS:000672774400005						
J	SPIRIDONOV, VA				SPIRIDONOV, VA			SPATIAL AND TEMPORAL VARIABILITY IN REPRODUCTIVE TIMING OF ANTARCTIC KRILL (EUPHAUSIA-SUPERBA DANA)	POLAR BIOLOGY												Spawning dates of Antarctic krill, Euphausia superba Dana, were calculated from larval stage compositions, and corrected using data on maturity stage composition of the adult krill. Both original and literature data obtained from the Antarctic Peninsula-Bellingshausen Sea area and around the Antarctic continent were used. A time series (1975/76-1986/87) for several subareas of the Antarctic Peninsula-Bellingshausen Sea area indicates considerable variation in the krill spawning start, maxima and completion. In particular years (1975/76, 1980/81), krill spawning in the western Atlantic sector began relatively early, was intensive, and completed early. Some years (1977/78, 1981/82) were characterised by long and non-synchronised krill spawning. Compiled data sets for the Atlantic sector (1980/81), the entire Antarctic (1983/84) and the east Indian-west Pacific Antarctic waters (1981-85) reveal some spatial patterns in krill reproductive timing. In relation to spawning timing variation, the habitats of the krill population fall into five categories: (1) areas with an early beginning (late November- early December) and a variable, but normally long, duration (3-3.5 months) of krill spawning; this is generally the southern boundary of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current, (2) areas with an early beginning, but a short duration of krill spawning (Gerlache Strait), (3) areas with a highly variable (within 1-1.5 months) beginning and a relatively long duration (ca. 3 months) of krill spawning (Bransfield Strait, Palmer Archipelago), (4) areas with a late beginning (late December-January) and a long duration of krill spawning (Bellingshausen Sea, D'Urville Sea, and Balleny Islands area), and (5) areas with a delayed beginning, but a very short duration (ca. 1.5 months) of krill spawning (Ross Sea slope, probably the Coastal Current area off the. Lasarev Sea shelf and in the south-eastern Weddell Sea. These patterns can be partly explained by peculiarities of the ice regime in particular areas and by routes of krill movement within water circulation systems.																	0722-4060					FEB	1995	15	3					161	174									WOS:A1995QJ51000002

Modeling the remote and local connectivity of Antarctic krill populations along the western Antarctic Peninsula	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												The abundance and distribution of Antarctic krill Euphausia superba over the western Antarctic Peninsula (wAP) continental shelf suggest that these populations are maintained by inputs from upstream sources via advection of individuals that originated in the Bellingshausen Sea, in addition to local spawning and retention. The objective of our study was to evaluate these 2 mechanisms (remote and local inputs) and the consequences for wAP Antarctic krill populations. The relative effect of local versus remote connectivity was investigated using Lagrangian particle tracking experiments. Particles released in the Bellingshausen Sea were transported to the wAP shelf in 120 d, which is consistent with the time required for Antarctic krill eggs to develop into late-stage larvae. An estimated 23% of the particles released along the shelf break crossed the outer shelf and were transported to the mid and inner regions of the wAP shelf via 3 pathways that provide conduits for onshore intrusions of Circumpolar Deep Water (CDW). Of the particles that moved onto the wAP shelf, 54% were transported to inner shelf regions that are associated with areas of enhanced biological production. Of the particles at the outer shelf similar to 33% continued transport northeastward with the Antarctic Circumpolar Current. Particles released in the mid and inner shelf showed limited connectivity and low export from the shelf (<20%). The Lagrangian experiments indicate that Antarctic krill populations in the Marguerite Bay region of the wAP continental shelf are maintained by local and remote inputs of larvae. Regions influenced by intrusions of CDW are more dependent on remote inputs of Antarctic krill larvae.

J	Hofmann, EE; Husrevoglu, YS				Hofmann, EE; Husrevoglu, YS			A circumpolar modeling study of habitat control of Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) reproductive success	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY												A one-dimensional, temperature-dependent model is implemented to simulate the descent-ascent cycle of Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) embryos and larvae. Inputs to the model are monthly mean climatologies of ambient temperature and density fields obtained from the World Ocean Atlas Database for Southern Ocean waters. Simulations are done with a 1degrees resolution at a circumpolar scale, south of 60degreesS, and the results are interpolated to a 5' grid to match the resolution of the bottom bathymetry data. Simulations of the descent-ascent cycle using environmental conditions corresponding to the Antarctic krill spawning season (December-March) resulted in unconstrained success in completion of the cycle in water deeper than 1000 in. Continental shelf regions favorable to successful hatching of Antarctic krill embryos are limited to areas along the west Antarctic Peninsula, large areas in the Bellingshausen and Amundsen Seas, offshore of Wilkes Land, and to the east and west of Prydz Bay. These are regions where the Southern Antarctic Circumpolar Current Front is along the shelf slope, the Antarctic Slope Front is absent, and Circumpolar Deep Water is present. The effect of seasonal variability in temperature on the descent-ascent cycle tends to enhance the probability of success in regions offshore of Wilkes Land, Queen Maud Land, and the eastern shelf of the Antarctic Peninsula later in the spawning season. The simulations show that success of the descent-ascent cycle is sensitive to initial embryo diameter and larval ascent rate. Initial embryo diameter may provide an additional constraint on success of the descent-ascent cycle, especially in continental shelf waters, where small embryos tend to encounter the bottom before hatching. The circumpolar distributions of simulated embryo hatching depth and larval success show that all regions of the Antarctic are not equal in the ability to support successful completion of the Antarctic krill descent-ascent cycle, which has implications for the overall circum-Antarctic krill distribution and for the development of nutrient and material budgets, especially for Antarctic continental shelf areas.

J	Taki, K; Hayashi, T; Naganobu, M				Taki, K; Hayashi, T; Naganobu, M			Characteristics of seasonal variation in diurnal vertical migration and aggregation of Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) in the Scotia Sea, using Japanese fishery data	CCAMLR SCIENCE												Seasonal variation in the diurnal vertical migration and aggregation of Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) associated with the daylight phase over the diurnal cycle (i.e. brightness categories) was examined for the Scotia Sea (South Shetland Islands (SS), South Orkney Islands (SO) and South Georgia (SG) areas) using Japanese fishery data. Average trawling depth usually showed a marked diurnal change during summer and winter in SS and SO. Daily average trawling depth tended to be shallower during austral summer and early autumn, deepened gradually from autumn and reached maximum depth in winter in the Scotia Sea, shifting to shallower depths again in early spring. The average catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) was highest during the day and lowest at night in autumn and winter in each area, but lower during the day in summer in SS and SO. It is suggested that the seasonal and diurnal changes in vertical migration and aggregation of krill are closely related to its feeding and spawning ecology and avoidance of visual predators.																	1023-4063						2005	12						163	172									WOS:000233386600010						
J	SIEGEL, V				SIEGEL, V			ASSESSMENT OF THE KRILL (EUPHAUSIA-SUPERBA) SPAWNING STOCK OFF THE ANTARCTIC PENINSULA	ARCHIV FUR FISCHEREIWISSENSCHAFT												A net sampling survey for krill was carried out by RV 'Meteor' along the Antarctic Peninsula from 26 December 1989 to 14 January 1990. Results were compared with data from a survey conducted by RV 'Polarstern' in 1987/88. Krill were distributed over 80% (89% in 1987/88) of the survey area. Main concentrations were observed near Elephant Island, King George Island, in the central Bransfield Strait and on the south-western shelf of the Peninsula. Four distinct site clusters of krill size classes and maturity stages were found, confirming the spatial succession of maturity stages from nearshore (7% juveniles, 84% early subadult stages) to oceanic waters (97%) gravid and spent stages). The spawning area can be characterized as a continuous belt with some local higher densities. Almost no gravid females occurred in Bransfield Strait waters. First occurrence of spent females indicated the onset of the breeding season in early january. juvenile krill of age group 1+ (year-class 1988/89) was almost missing in the stock. Total amount of krill was higher in 1987/88 than in 1989/90. Stratified mean biomass integrated over 200 m depth was 4.5 g/m2 and 6.13 g/m2 in 1987/88. Total instantaneous biomass was calculated as 1.16 - 10(6) tonnes (1989/90) and 1.65 . 10(6) tonnes (1987/88), respectively. More than 96% of the krill biomass occurred in the upper 0-60 m depth stratum. Seasonal variation between summer and winter abundance/biomass data exceeded a factor of 35 times, while interannual variability between available summer surveys reached only a factor of 1.6 times. Krill mortality was calculated by linearized catch curve analysis and resulted in a rate of Z=M=0.88 (1989/90) and 0.96 (1987/88). Production was estimated and resulted in a P/B ratio of 0.88 to 0.94 for different years. The exchange rate of water masses and krill biomass within one summer season was roughly estimated as 2 times from which follows a maximum total effective biomass (including production) of 4.3 and 5.0 . 10(6) tonnes passing through the survey area during the respective summers.																	0003-9063					JUN	1992	41	2					101	130									WOS:A1992HX59400001

Factors determining the hatching success of Antarctic krill Euphausia superba embryo: lipid and fatty acid composition	MARINE BIOLOGY												The present study addresses the effect of maternal diet on hatching success and condition of embryos and larvae of Antarctic krill Euphausia superba. Lipid and fatty acid content and composition were determined in field and laboratory samples. Developmental stages analyzed in embryos included: multiple-cell, gastrula, and limb-bud stages. Larval stages analyzed included: nauplius I, nauplius II, and metanauplius. Laboratory-reared embryos were spawned by gravid females incubated under three feeding groups: (1) phytoplankton mixture, (2) phytoplankton mixture and minced clam, and (3) phytoplankton mixture, minced clam, and commercial larval food. Hatching success was highest in group 3 (100%), lowest in group 1 (0%), and highly variable in field samples (0-48%). Lipid decreased slightly in embryos during embryonic development, while large decreases in lipid were found during nauplius development. High levels of 18: 2(n-6), 20: 4(n-6), and 22: 6(n-3) observed with group 3 samples coincided with high hatching success in krill embryos. The ratio of 22: 6(n-3)/20: 5(n-3) also correlated to hatching success of embryos. The fatty acid profile of embryos in group 3 was similar to that of the field-collected embryos, reflecting the contribution of the commercial larval food in the maternal diet. In our study, the maternal diet was found to influence the fatty acid composition of embryos and in turn affects the hatching success of krill. Specific polyunsaturated fatty acids appeared to play important roles in embryogenesis in krill.

J	Fach, BA; Klinck, JM				Fach, Bettina A.; Klinck, John M.			Transport of Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) across the Scotia Sea. Part I: Circulation and particle tracking simulations	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART I-OCEANOGRAPHIC RESEARCH PAPERS												The Harvard Ocean Prediction System (HOPS) is configured to simulate the circulation of the Scotia Sea and environs. This is part of a study designed to test the hypothesis that Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) populations at South Georgia in the eastern Scotia Sea are sustained by import of individuals from upstream regions, such as the western Antarctic Peninsula. Comparison of the simulated circulation fields obtained from HOPS with observations showed good agreement. The surface circulation, particularly through the Drake Passage and across the Scotia Sea, matches observations, with its northeastward flow characterized by three high-speed fronts. Also, the Weddell Sea and the Brazil Current, and their associated transports match observations. In addition, mesoscale variability, an important component of the flow in this region, is found in the simulated circulation and the model is overall well suited to model krill transport. Drifter simulations conducted with HOPS showed that krill spawned in areas coinciding with known krill spawning sites along the west Antarctic Peninsula continental shelf can be entrained into the Southern Antarctic Circumpolar Current Front (SACCF). They are transported across the Scotia Sea to South Georgia in 10 months or less. Drifters originating on the continental shelf of the Weddell Sea can reach South Georgia as well; however, transport from this region averages about 20 months. Additional simulations show that such transport is sensitive to changes in wind stress and the location of the SACCF. The results of this study show that krill populations along the Antarctic Peninsula and the Weddell Sea are possible source populations that can provide krill to the South Georgia population. However, successful transport of krill to South Georgia is shown to depend on a multitude of factors, such as the location of the spawning area and timing of spawning, and variations in the location of the SACCF. Therefore, this study provides insight into which environmental factors control the successful transport of krill across the Scotia Sea and with it a better understanding of krill distribution in the region.

Length at maturity L(50) is defined as the length at which 50% of the krill stock attains sexual maturity. L(50) values of 34.65-35.91 mm for female krill are the best estimates for the peak spawning season. Males attain sexual maturity later at L(50) values of 43.35-43.71 mm, Length at maturity and length at first spawning are identical for krill. Comparisons with mean length-at-age data show that females mature in the third growth season (age class 2+), while males reach maturity in the fourth year (age class 3+). Both sexes show 'knife-edge maturity'.																	0954-1020					DEC	1994	6	4					479	482		10.1017/S0954102094000726							WOS:A1994QA66500007						
J	Marrari, M; Daly, KL; Hu, CM				Marrari, Marina; Daly, Kendra L.; Hu, Chuanmin			Spatial and temporal variability of SeaWiFS chlorophyll a distributions west of the Antarctic Peninsula: Implications for krill production	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY												ScaWiFS chlorophyll a distributions between 1997 and 2004 were investigated in relation to sea-ice dynamics for waters west of the Antarctic Peninsula (55-75 degrees S, 50-80 degrees W) in order to better understand the reproductive patterns and recruitment success of the Antarctic krill, Euphausia superba. Climatology patterns showed that the Bellingshausen Sea and Marguerite Bay region usually had higher chlorophyll a concentrations, which persisted throughout austral spring and summer, compared with more northern regions along the Antarctic Peninsula and the western Scotia Sea. These predictable and long-lasting phytoplankton accumulations could provide krill with the food levels required for successful reproduction and larval survival. Unusually high krill reproduction in 2000/2001 was coincident with above-average chlorophyll a concentrations throughout most of the study area and resulted in the largest juvenile recruitment (in 2001/2002) since 1981. High larval densities (up to 132 ind m(-3)) at the shelf break along the Antarctic Peninsula may have resulted, in part, from krill spawning in the Bellingshausen Sea. In general, ice-edge blooms were only a significant feature in the southern sectors of our study area, particularly in the Bellingshausen Sea and, thus, may not support krill reproduction in the northern Peninsula region as previously believed. Instead, phytoplankton blooms during spring in the northern region appeared to be governed by shelf-break processes, such as upwelling of iron-rich deep water. Interannual differences in sea ice also probably contributed to the variability in larval krill abundances observed in Marguerite Bay. Sea ice melted early in 2000/2001, allowing elevated phytoplankton blooms to develop. In contrast, sea ice persisted throughout spring and summer 2001/2002 limiting phytoplankton accumulation, particularly in southern Marguerite Bay. Thus, the early and extended availability of elevated chlorophyll a concentrations during spring and summer 2000/2001, particularly in the vicinity of Marguerite Bay and to the south in the Bellingshausen Sea, as well as reduced sea ice in coastal areas, likely supported the unusually high densities of larval krill observed during fall in waters west of the Antarctic Peninsula.

Moult stage, maturity stage, and size of ca. 100 krill from each swarm were measured. Each of the characteristics varied greatly between swarms. Moulting krill were found in most swarms, but in one swarm all of the krill were just about to moult. Ways in which moulting may act as a possible sorting mechanism are discussed. Data for all the analysed krill (ca. 3000 specimens) were used to investigate the interdependence of moult rate, sexual maturation and growth. While all immature krill moulted at approximately the same rate in the study, there were significant differences in the moulting rates of mature male and female krill. Gravid female krill continued to moult, although less frequently than mature males. As a con sequence males had to attach spermatophores to females after each moult. It is likely that variation in moult rate of females and males was related to the energy expenditure required for ovary development in females and spermatophore production and searching behaviour in males. Spawning and moulting were only partly coupled in gravid females. Spawning appeared to take place predominantly during Moult Stage D-2. There was no evidence of intermoult growth by intersegmental dilation.																	0025-3162					DEC	1996	127	2					201	208		10.1007/BF00942104							WOS:A1996WH77200003

Recruitment of Antarctic krill Euphausia superba in the South Georgia region: adult fecundity and the fate of larvae	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												The high concentration of adult Antarctic krill Euphausia superba Dana around South Georgia, Antarctica, is a product of immigration and not local recruitment. We investigated whether reproduction and early larval development are the cause of local recruitment failure. It was found that the majority of adult females were reproductively active in summer and that there was a comparatively high investment in the ovary, reaching up to 46% of the total wet weight of the krill. The corresponding egg batches were amongst the largest ever reported for E. superba. A semi-empirical model predicted that 11% of females completed just 1 spawning episode per year, 60% completed 2, and 29% completed 3 or more. On average, a South Georgian krill released 12 343 eggs yr(-1). The eggs were unable to complete the descent-ascent developmental cycle on-shelf because the bathymetry was too shallow but, off-shelf, they were predicted to sink to between 490 and 520 m and return to the surface either as a metanauplius or 1st calyptopis stage with plenty of energy reserves remaining. Feeding conditions were adequate for the development of later larval stages once these reserves were exhausted. Although net surveys found calyptopis and early stage furcilia in the vicinity of South Georgia, numbers were mostly lower than predicted. Overall, reproduction or early stage development are successful in this region, leaving predation on larvae and advective export during winter as the main potential causes of local recruitment failure.

Early spawning of Antarctic krill in the Scotia Sea is fuelled by "superfluous" feeding on non-ice associated phytoplankton blooms	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY												The spawning success of Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) is generally assumed to depend on substantial winter sea ice extent, as ice biota can serve as a food source during winter/spring and the seasonal ice melt conditions the upper water column for extensive phytoplankton blooms. However, direct observations during spring are rare. Here we studied krill body condition and maturity stage in relation to feeding (i.e. stomach fullness, diet, absorption of individual fatty acids and defecation rate) across the Scotia Sea in November 2006. The phytoplankton concentrations were low at the marginal ice zone (MIZ) in the southern Scotia Sea (Stn. 1, 2, and 3), high in open waters of the Southern Antarctic Circumpolar Current Front (SACCF) in the central Scotia Sea (Stn. 5), and moderate further north (Stn. 6 and 7). Krill had low lipid reserves (similar to 6.5% of dry mass. DM), low mass:length ratios (similar to 1.7 mg DM mm(-1)), and small digestive glands (similar to 7% of total DM) near the ice edge. The stomachs contained lithogenic particles, diatom debris, and bacterial fatty acids, but low proportions of diatom-indicating fatty acids, which suggest that these krill were feeding on detritus rather than on fresh ice algae. In the SACCF, krill had higher lipid reserves (similar to 10% of DM), high mass:length ratios (similar to 2.2 mg DM mm(-1)), and large digestive glands (similar to 16% of total DM). Stomach content and tissue composition indicate feeding on diatoms. In the north, moderate food concentrations co-occurred with low lipid reserves in krill, and moderate mass:length ratios and digestive gland sizes. Only in the phytoplankton bloom in the SACCF had the mating season already started and some females were about to spawn. Based on the way krill processed their food at the different stations, we indicate two mechanisms that can lead to fast regeneration of body reserves and oocyte maturation in E. superba. One is "superfluous" feeding at high food concentrations, which maximises the overall nutrient gain. The other is a preferential absorption of crucial fatty acids: 20:5(n-3) and 22:6(n-3) when regaining body condition after the winter, and 14:0 and 16:1(n-7) during accumulation of oocyte yolk. Multi-year time series of phytoplankton distribution show that an early spring bloom, as found in 2006, is not unusual for the central Scotia Sea and coincides with high krill larval concentrations in this area. In conclusion, the Scotia Sea is a main spawning ground of Antarctic krill and this is linked to phytoplankton blooms in open waters of the SACCF rather than to ice edge blooms.

Modeling Antarctic Krill Circumpolar Spawning Habitat Quality to Identify Regions With Potential to Support High Larval Production	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS												Antarctic krill (krill) are important within Southern Ocean ecosystems and support an expanding fishery. Toward understanding krill's response to environmental change, it is necessary to identify regions that support high krill larval production (spawning habitat). We develop a mechanistic model combining thermal and food requirements for krill egg production, with predation pressure post-spawning, to predict regions of high-quality spawning habitat. We optimize our model regionally and generate circumpolar predictions of spawning habitat quality. Our results indicate the southwest Atlantic accounts for almost half of all predicted high-quality spawning habitat. Small-scale management units (SSMUs) around the Antarctic Peninsula had high coverage of high-quality spawning habitat. In contrast, the remaining SSMUs (except around South Georgia) were poorly covered, suggestive of population sinks reliant on input from external sources upstream. This implies strong potential for downstream impacts of fishing in key spawning areas, with implications for management of SSMUs and the krill fishery.

Modeling environmental controls on the transport and fate of early life stages of Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) on the western Antarctic Peninsula continental shelf	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART I-OCEANOGRAPHIC RESEARCH PAPERS												A one-dimensional, temperature-dependent model was used to simulate the descent ascent cycle of the embryos and early larval stages of Antarctic krill to determine which regions of the western Antarctic Peninsula (wAP) continental shelf support successful completion of this cycle under present environmental conditions and those projected to occur as a result of climate change. The transport and fate of the embryo and larva under present and modified conditions was investigated with Lagrangian particle tracking simulations. The two modeling studies were implemented using temperature and density (embryo larva model) and circulation distributions (Lagrangian particle tracking) obtained from a high resolution version of the Regional Ocean Modeling System configured for the wAP shelf region. Additional simulations used temperature and circulation distributions obtained from simulations that were forced with increased wind speed and increased transport of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC), both projected to possibly occur with climate change in the wAP region. Simulations using present conditions showed that successful completion of the descent ascent cycle occurred along the outer shelf and on the shelf in regions with bottom depths of 600-700 m. Estimated residence times for the shelf regions that support success of the embryo and larva were 20-30 days. Thus, krill spawned in the mid and inner shelf regions can be retained in these regions through development to the first feeding stage (calyptopis 1). Increased winds and ACC transport resulted in more onshelf transport of Circumpolar Deep Water (CDW), which increased the volume of warm (1-1.5 degrees C) water at depth. These conditions supported a moderate increase in success of the krill embryo and larva, but only for limited areas of the shelf where hatching depths decreased by 10-30 m (<5%) and development time to the calyptopis 1 stage decreased by 15-20%. The modified circulation conditions also supported increased advection of krill larvae into areas of the shelf that would experience the largest reduction of sea ice, especially in winter. Projected changes in wind strength and COW transport may potentially enhance larval survival and advection onto the wAP shelf, but recruitment may be decreased by modifications to local sea ice distributions that would impede survival of Antarctic krill that overwinter on the shelf.

Selectivity and two biomass measures in an age-based assessment of Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba)	FISHERIES RESEARCH												An integrated, age-structured model was fitted to different combinations of survey data using two forms of selectivity (logistic or double-logistic) with time-constant or annually varying selectivity to investigate the population dynamics of Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) near the Antarctic Peninsula. The data were from surveys conducted by the U.S. Antarctic Marine Living Resources Program around the South Shetland Islands from 1992 to 2011. Two indices of krill biomass based on (1) trawl-net samples and (2) hydroacoustic sampling were combined with length-compositions from the nets. Sixteen model configurations using different combinations of the two biomass surveys with the various options for modeling selectivities were examined. Parameters were estimated in phases with the sequential order of the phases randomized until an invertible Hessian matrix was obtained. Model consistency for the estimates of derived quantities was tested using simulated data. Annual trends in the estimates of total biomass, spawning biomass, and recruitment were similar among different configurations assuming time-constant selectivity, but the absolute scaling ranged widely depending on which biomass indices were used. All configurations with time-constant selectivities were able to reproduce the derived quantities of the operating model when fitted to simulated data. Annually varying selectivities produced more variable estimates of the trends in population biomass, but less variable estimates of scale, compared to time-constant configurations fitted to the same data. The models with annually varying selectivities did not produce invertible Hessian matrices, and four of these configurations could not reproduce the derived parameters of their operating model when fitted to simulated data. Using AIC, the model with logistic, time-constant selectivities was selected as the best configuration to fit both sources of biomass data. The two-stage approach of first randomizing the phase order until an invertible Hessian matrix is achieved and then verifying the reproducibility of the estimates of derived quantities using simulated data could be employed in any integrated stock assessment with parameters estimated in phases.

Habitat partitioning in Antarctic krill: Spawning hotspots and nursery areas	PLOS ONE												Antarctic krill, Euphausia superba, have a circumpolar distribution but are concentrated within the south-west Atlantic sector, where they support a unique food web and a commercial fishery. Within this sector, our first goal was to produce quantitative distribution maps of all six ontogenetic life stages of krill (eggs, nauplii plus metanauplii, calyptopes, furcilia, juveniles, and adults), based on a compilation of all available post 1970s data. Using these maps, we then examined firstly whether "hotspots" of egg production and early stage nursery occurred, and secondly whether the available habitat was partitioned between the successive life stages during the austral summer and autumn, when krill densities can be high. To address these questions, we compiled larval krill density records and extracted data spanning 41 years (1976-2016) from the existing KRILLBASE-abundance and KRILLBASE-length-frequency databases. Although adult males and females of spawning age were widely distributed, the distribution of eggs, nauplii and metanauplii indicates that spawning is most intense over the shelf and shelf slope. This contrasts with the distributions of calyptope and furcilia larvae, which were concentrated further offshore, mainly in the Southern Scotia Sea. Juveniles, however, were strongly concentrated over shelves along the Scotia Arc. Simple environmental analyses based on water depth and mean water temperature suggest that krill associate with different habitats over the course of their life cycle. From the early to late part of the austral season, juvenile distribution moves from ocean to shelf, opposite in direction to that for adults. Such habitat partitioning may reduce intraspecific competition for food, which has been suggested to occur when densities are exceptionally high during years of strong recruitment. It also prevents any potential cannibalism by adults on younger stages. Understanding the location of krill spawning and juvenile development in relation to potentially overlapping fishing activities is needed to protect the health of the south-west Atlantic sector ecosystem.

We present a new method for staging sexual development of female krill, and a key which can be used for live animals and Formalin-fixed samples. The key takes into account female general appearance, thelycum development, ovarian morphology, and developmental steps of changes in the ovarian cells. This staging method is based on the results of a histological study of ovarian development, but the use of the key itself involves only simple observations and rapid execution of a squash from a piece of the ovary. The reproductive cycle of krill is divided into 10 stages: 8 stages for ovarian development leading to egg production, and 2 stages for sexual regression and reorganization after spawning periods. We believe that such a method could be useful for predicting spawning events and their timing for Antarctic krill, and for a better estimation of fecundity and related energy requirements. Similar keys devised for other euphausiids and free-spawning pelagic crustaceans will allow comparisons among different reproductive strategies.																	0278-0372					MAY	1991	11	2					236	249		10.2307/1548361							WOS:A1991FL24900005						
J	Siegel, V				Siegel, Volker			Krill stocks in high latitudes of the Antarctic Lazarev Sea: seasonal and interannual variation in distribution, abundance and demography	POLAR BIOLOGY												The motivation of the LAKRIS project (Lazarev Krill Study) was to investigate the seasonal and interannual variability in distribution, demography, phenology and population dynamics of Antarctic krill Euphausia superba in poorly studied high-latitude areas. The core data set consists of four RMT-net-sampling surveys that were conducted in early summer (December 2005 and 2007), autumn (April 2004) and winter (July to August 2006). Supplementary data were analysed from the 1980s to view the results in a wider geographical context. The major observations are the following: (1) krill abundance and distribution showed geographical, seasonal and interannual fluctuations. Krill abundance was almost one order of magnitude lower compared to the Southwest Atlantic. (2) Krill density showed substantial differences between day and night for autumn and winter surveys. (3) A spatial gradient was observed for krill size groups, with larger sized (adult spawning) krill further south and medium-sized juveniles and immatures mainly between 60A degrees and 67A degrees S. (4) Data on maturity stage composition and larvae occurrence indicate an active and successful spawning in these high-latitude areas even under the conditions of sea-ice cover. At the end of the spawning season, females and males regressed in their external sexual characteristics ('re-juvenation') to overwintering immature stages. Major conclusions relate to a conceptual view of the spatial distribution of krill size classes and the occurrence of larvae in the context of major oceanographic features and current systems in the Lazarev Sea and adjacent ocean sectors. The Lazarev Sea obviously does not support a single self-maintaining population, but represents a complex transition zone of stocks with different origins from the Scotia Sea and the Cosmonaut Sea.																	0722-4060	1432-2056				AUG	2012	35	8					1151	1177		10.1007/s00300-012-1162-y							WOS:000306345800003

Euphausia superba, in the central part of the Indian sector of the Southern Ocean. e.g., the Cooperation Sea (Prydz Bay region) and the Cosmonaut Sea, during austral summers 1977-1990 were summarized to estimate growth rates, longevity, reproduction, recruitment, life span, and mortality rates. The life span of Antarctic krill exceeds 5 years in both the Cosmonaut and Cooperation seas. The age composition of the southern and northern groupings differs markedly, with substantial reduction in numbers of early ape groups in the northern grouping. Long-term observations of spawning success, recruitment, and age composition suggest that a self-sustained grouping of krill persists in the Cooperation Sea south of the Antarctic Divergence. How ever, periodic gene flow via recruits from surrounding regions most probably accounts for the lack of spatial genetic differences between the Cooperation Sea and adjacent areas, thus preventing the establishment of an isolated subpopulation in the region investigated. The major factor responsible for the substantial interannual variability in krill dynamics appears to be macroscale oceanographic and atmospheric circulations. which determine a level of environmental isolation of the Cooperation Sea from adjacent waters.																	0706-652X						2000	57			3			68	90		10.1139/cjfas-57-S3-68							WOS:000166531600009

From early to mid-summer krill density increased and showed distinct offshore-inshore differences in abundance and maturity stages. In mid-summer, krill density was low in the oceanic zone (8 gm(-2)) and higher in the slope frontal zone (36 gm(-2)), being highest along the shelf break (131 gm(-2)) in the inshore zone. Krill were in the reproductive stage in the oceanic and frontal zones, but non-reproductive in the inshore zone. Water circulation, food and frontal features were considered important environmental factors determining the occurrence of high krill concentrations in these waters. Drifting buoys indicated that the surface water circulation in areas of krill concentrations was characterized by a sluggish current with eddies along the shelf break in the inshore zone and a shear current in the frontal zone, thus enhancing the residence time for krill. Diatom abundance in both the frontal and inshore zones increased from early to mid-summer, improving krill feeding conditions. Gravid females were closely associated with the frontal zone, showing that the latter may also be a favored spawning area because of the higher probability of survival for embryos and larvae, in addition to enhanced opportunities for their transport to nursery grounds by prevailing currents. In the waters north of the South Shetland Islands, krill appeared to be highly adapted for exploitation of the rich food resources of the frontal/inshore zone, taking advantage of oceanographic features that led to their retention in these zones.

POLAR BIOLOGY												The Southern Ocean is expected to be significantly affected by future ocean acidification. Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) is the key species of the Southern Ocean ecosystem. Understanding their behavioural responses to acidification is critical for assessing the impacts of ocean acidification on the ecosystem. Adult Antarctic krill reared in different holding tanks with various CO2 levels for 6 months prior to the experiments were tested for their behavioural responses to different carbon dioxide partial pressures (pCO(2)) (400, 1000, 1500, 2000, and 4000 mu atm pCO(2)) in a two-channel flume. The time krill occupied either of the flume channels (with high or ambient CO2 levels) was highly variable in all tests. In most cases no significant preference to either side of the flume was found. The krill did not display any systematic discrimination to the sea water with different CO2 levels regardless of the CO2 levels that krill were acclimated for in the 6 months prior to the experiment. Poor ability to discriminate high CO2 waters may have an important implication to their life history in the future as ocean acidification rapidly progresses in parts of Southern Ocean.

The krill catch is increasing, is concentrated in a small area, and has shifted seasonally from summer to autumn/winter. The fishery is managed by the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources, with the main goal of safeguarding the large populations of krill-dependent predators. Here we show that, because of the restricted distribution of successfully spawning krill and high inter-annual variability in their biomass, the risk of direct fishery impacts on the krill stock itself might be higher than previously thought. We show how management benefits could be achieved by incorporating uncertainty surrounding key aspects of krill ecology into management decisions, and how knowledge can be improved in these key areas. This improved information may be supplied, in part, by the fishery itself. Understanding of Antarctic krill must be at the heart of krill fishery management in order to protect the stock and its predators, according to a synthesis of krill ecology research.

The catch remained relatively stable at around 120 000 tonnes for 17 years until 2009, but has recently increased to more than 200 000 tonnes. The Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources precautionary catch limits for this species total over 8.6 million tonnes so it remains one of the oceans largest known underexploited stocks. Recent developments in harvesting technology and in products being derived from krill indicate renewed interest in exploiting this resource. At the same time, there are changes in the Southern Ocean environment that are affecting both krill and the fishery. This paper summarizes the current state of this fishery and highlights the changes that are affecting it.

J	Nicol, S; Endo, Y				Nicol, S; Endo, Y			Krill fisheries: Development, management and ecosystem implications	AQUATIC LIVING RESOURCES												There are currently at least six commercial fisheries harvesting six different species of euphausiid, or krill: Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba), fished in the Antarctic; North Pacific krill (Euphausia pacifica), fished off Japan and off western Canada; Euphausia nana, fished off the coast of Japan; Thysanoessa inermis, fished off the coast of Japan and off eastern Canada; and Thysanoessa raschii and Meganyctiphanes norvegica which have been experimentally harvested off eastern Canada. The current world catch of all species of krill is over 150 000 tonnes per annum but few fisheries are being exploited to their maximum theoretical potential. The size of the world krill harvest is currently limited by lack of demand, although some fisheries are being deliberately managed at low levels because of ecological concerns. We have outlined the history of these krill fisheries to determine where there are common trends and issues which will affect their future development. Krill products are currently mostly used for the aquaculture and sport fishing market but considerable effort has also been put into developing products for human consumption, particularly from Antarctic krill. The future development of krill fisheries is examined in the light of information on trends in krill products which include pharmaceutical and industrial uses in addition to nutritional products. Because of the central ecological role of krill in many marine ecosystems, the subject of krill harvesting is a sensitive issue and krill fisheries require careful management. This requirement has spawned an innovative international management regime in the Antarctic - the Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR) - which has developed procedures for managing the harvest of Antarctic krill that may be applicable to other fisheries. The common problems of managing krill fisheries are outlined particularly those relating to the role of krill in many coastal ecosystems, and as prey for many other species which are commercially fished.

Circumpolar patterns in Antarctic krill larval recruitment: an environmentally driven model	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												Larval recruitment in Antarctic krill is known to be episodic and regional. We consider the importance of a range of recruitment factors using an environmentally driven model of larval development from spawning to post-larvae. Our model examines the timing of spawning, interaction with bathymetry, susceptibility to cold temperatures, temperature-driven development and the seasonal cycle of sea ice to identify those factors with the greatest impact. The model predicts that the seasonal location of sea ice is the main limiting factor for successful larval recruitment. Spawning in January leads to the greatest area of viable larval recruitment habitat. Dense sea ice cover, which we assume that adult krill do not spawn under, prevents spawning in large areas early in the breeding season (December). Nevertheless, later spawning in February, when sea ice is at a minimum, means there is often insufficient time for the larvae to reach a viable developmental stage before the sea ice advances. Meanwhile, although spawning is possible in more northerly areas throughout the breeding season, these are generally remote from winter sea ice, which is assumed to be necessary for larvae to overwinter. Interaction with bathymetry before hatching further limits suitable habitat. Over a 12 yr period, the model predicted larval recruitment from January spawning in all years in the Cooperation, Ross and Weddell Seas, with episodic larval recruitment in the Bransfield Strait in 9 of the 12 years. Additional understanding of the overwintering requirements of larvae, together with regional studies at higher spatial resolution, particularly in shelf regions, will better constrain the uncertainties in the model.

Temperature-Induced Hatch Failure and Nauplii Malformation in Antarctic Krill	FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE												Antarctic krill inhabit areas of the Southern Ocean that can exceed 4.0 degrees C, yet they preferentially inhabit regions with temperatures of -1.5 to <= 1.5 degrees C. Successful embryonic development and hatching are key to their life cycle, but despite the rapid climatic warming seen across their main spawning areas, the effects of elevated temperatures on embryogenesis, hatching success, and nauplii malformations are unknown. We incubated 24,483 krill embryos in two independent experiments to investigate the hypothesis that temperatures exceeding 1.5 degrees C have a negative impact on hatching success and increase the numbers of malformed nauplii. Field experiments were on krill collected from near the northern, warm limit of their range and embryos incubated soon after capture, while laboratory experiments were on embryos from krill acclimated to laboratory conditions. The hatching success of embryo batches varied enormously, from 0 to 98% (mean 27%). Both field and laboratory experiments showed that hatching success decreased markedly above 3.0 degrees C. Our field experiments also showed an approximate doubling of the percentage of malformed nauplii at elevated temperatures, reaching 50% at 5.0 degrees C. At 3.0 degrees C or below, however, temperature was not the main factor driving the large variation in embryo hatching success. Our observations of highly variable and often low success of hatching to healthy nauplii suggest that indices of reproductive potential of female krill relate poorly to the subsequent production of viable krill larvae and may help to explain spatial discrepancies between the distribution of the spawning stock and larval distribution.

Projected changes of Antarctic krill habitat by the end of the 21st century	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS												Climate change is rapidly shaping the living environment of the most abundant keystone species of the Antarctic marine food web, Antarctic krill. Projected future changes for the krill habitat include a sustained increase in ocean temperature and changes in sea ice and chlorophyll a. Here we investigate how these factors affect the early life history of krill and identify the regions around Antarctica where the impact will be greatest. Our tool is a temperature-dependent krill growth model forced by data from comprehensive greenhouse warming simulations. We find that by the year 2100 localized regions along the western Weddell Sea, isolated areas of the Indian Antarctic , and the Amundsen/Bellingshausen Sea will support successful spawning habitats for krill. The failure of potentially successful spawning will have a strong impact on the already declining adult populations with consequences for the Antarctic marine food web, having both ecological and commercial ramifications.																	0094-8276	1944-8007				AUG 28	2016	43	16					8580	8589		10.1002/2016GL069656							WOS:000384443800030						
J	Nicol, S; Foster, J				Nicol, S; Foster, J			Recent trends in the fishery for Antarctic krill	AQUATIC LIVING RESOURCES												The fishery for Antarctic krill has been stable for a decade with approximately 100 000 tonnes being caught each year. There is continuing commercial interest in products derived from krill. An examination of patent databases indicates that the development of products for human consumption has been overtaken by the development of aquaculture, pharmaceutical and medical products. The development of products for aquaculture is most likely to be the factor that will drive growth in the krill fishing industry. Management of the Antarctic krill fishery has proceeded in advance of expansion and precautionary catch limits for Antarctic krill currently total 4.89 million tonnes similar to50 times the existing harvesting level.

Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) meal in the diets improved the reproductive performance of tongue sole (Cynoglossus semilaevis) broodstock	AQUACULTURE NUTRITION												A three-month feeding trial was conducted to investigate the effects of dietary krill meal on the reproductive performance of tongue sole broodstock. Three diets were formulated to contain different levels of krill meal, 0 (Diet K-0), 10 (K-100) and 200 (K-200) g kg(-1) dry matter, replacing the corresponding contents of protein and lipid from fishmeal and fish oil. Each diet was assigned to triplicate tanks. Compared with K-0, both K-100 and K-200 increased the egg properties such as buoyant eggs rate, egg diameter, oil droplet diameter and SOD activity of the fertilized egg. However, the maturation rate, serum estradiol content, the relative fecundity and hatching rate were improved only by K-100. The krill meal supplementation increased the concentrations of astaxanthin and n-3 fatty acids in eggs, but decreased the n-6 fatty acid concentrations. Both K-100 and K-200 increased the survival activity index, but the larval deformity rate was decreased only by K-100. At 15 DPH, the larval length and the digestive enzyme activities were significantly higher in group K-200 compared with groups K-0 and K-100. In conclusion, dietary supplementation of krill meal, at the level of 100 or 200 g kg(-1) dry matter in exchange of fishmeal and fish oil had the considerable positive effects on C.semilaevis reproduction.

J	Hofmann, EE; Murphy, EJ				Hofmann, EE; Murphy, EJ			Advection, krill, and Antarctic marine ecosystems	ANTARCTIC SCIENCE												Advective processes are recognized as being important in structuring and maintaining marine ecosystems. In the Southern Ocean advective effects are perhaps most clearly observed because the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) provides a connection between most parts of the system, including open ocean and continental shelf regions. The ACC also provides a mechanism for large-scale transport of plankton, such as Antarctic krill (Euphousia superba Dana), which is an important component of the Southern Ocean food web. This overview provides a summary of recent observational and modelling results that consider the importance of advection to the Southern Ocean ecosystem and, in particular, the role of advection in structuring the large-scale distribution of Antarctic krill. The results of these studies show that advection is a dominant process controlling Antarctic krill distribution and by inference an important process affecting overall structure and production of the Southern Ocean food web. The overview shows that quantifying the roles of advective and retentive physical processes, and population dynamic and behavioural biological processes in determining the regional and local distribution of krill and abundance will be an important research focus. Strategies for future Antarctic multidisciplinary research programmes that are focused on understanding advective processes at a circumpolar scale are Suggested.																	0954-1020	1365-2079				DEC	2004	16	4					487	499		10.1017/S0954102004002275							WOS:000226060800010

The research area comprised offshore, ice-edge and Ross Sea areas. Of the 3 years (1990/91, 1992/93 and 1994/95) included in the study, 1994/95 was a year of significantly poor body fat condition compared with the other 2 years. The 1994/95 year was characterized by extensive sea-ice conditions, covering the usually krill-rich slope region throughout the season. Since minke whales were scarce and their stomach-content mass small in the ice-edge area during 1994/95, food availability in the area during the season was considered to be poor as a result of the high sea-ice extent. Antarctic krill Euphausia superba was regularly the dominant prey species throughout the survey area, although on the Ross Sea shelf E. crystallorophias was the codominant prey with E. superba. The spatial distribution of body size and maturity of E. superba indicated apparent unsuitability of the Ross Sea area as a nursery and spawning ground for that species. The Ross Sea area was considered to be an area of low food supply throughout the study period, considering the lower level of stomach contents. Paradoxically, this area usually contained numerous minke whales, especially pregnant females. In conclusion, minke whales appear to have been affected by considerable interannual variability in food availability in the ice-edge area, i.e. potentially the most krill-rich area along their migratory route.																	0171-8630						1998	175						1	12		10.3354/meps175001							WOS:000077992700001

Comparative morphology of Southern Ocean Euphausia species: ecological significance of sexual dimorphic features	POLAR BIOLOGY												Species of the genus Euphausia dominate the euphausiid biomass of the Southern Ocean, the three largest being Euphausia superba, E. triacantha and E. crystallorophias. We measured a number of morphological features to identify differences between, and within, these species to obtain ecological insights. Interspecifically, the greatest difference was carapace size, with that of E. superba being by far the largest and most variable. This likely reflects its prolific spawning capacity compared with other euphausiid species. E. triacantha exhibited an extended sixth abdominal segment that could facilitate greater levels of thrust in the tail flip escape response. The pleopods, which provide propulsion in forward swimming, were more than 50% larger in E. superba, indicating a greater capacity for directional movement at high velocities. E. crystallorophias had eyes that were almost double the size of those in E. superba and E. triacantha, which may help retain visual resolution within its under-ice habitat. Intraspecifically, we found the above morphological features differed little between sexes and developmental stages in E. crystallorophias and E. triacantha, but differed significantly in E. superba. Compared to females and juveniles, male E. superba had significantly larger eyes and pleopods, whilst the carapace in males became shorter as a proportion of body length during growth. These features indicate a greater capacity for searching and swimming in males, which, we hypothesise, increases their ability to locate and fertilise females. This morphological specialisation in male E. superba is indicative of comparatively greater inter-male competition resulting from its tendency to form large, dense swarms.

The Antarctic Peninsula region has been well studied because it is an important feeding, spawning, and nursery ground for Antarctic krill, Euphausia superba, the keystone species for the Antarctic marine food web. The physical and biological data sets collected in this region allow examination of seasonal, interannual and longer-scale ecosystem variability and the coupled atmospheric-oceanic-ice processes that underlie this variability. Evidence is presented that supports the hypothesis that this region is strongly impacted by meridional atmosphere teleconnections instigated in the western tropical Pacific Ocean by El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) variability that exhibits a 3- to 5-year periodicity.																			978-1-4020-5850-9				2007	2						197	225									WOS:000248254100010

Strong site-to-site variability was recorded which could only partially be related to sex or development stage differences. Three groups of stations could be differentiated. Northern stations were characterized by 'high lipid-high triglyceride' content, western and eastern locations by 'high lipid-high phosphatidyl choline' content and southern areas by 'low lipid-high phosphatidyl ethanolamine/glycolipid' content. Such variability was likely related to advected populations having spent variable lengths of time in the area studied. Lipid content and class among organs were studied in 5 body fractions: abdomen, stomach, digestive gland, gonad and fat body. In absolute terms, the highest concentrations were observed in the ovaries of mature females and the abdomens of the other stages. In relative terms (% dry weight), the digestive gland displayed the highest level, except in mature females. Distribution varied with stages, with low triglyceride levels in abdomen tissues of most stages and in the fat body and stomach fractions of subadults. High triglyceride levels were recorded in the other fractions for post spawning females and males, as well as in the fat body fraction for mature females and in subadult gonads. A reverse pattern was observed for the relative content of phosphatidyl choline. Phosphatidyl ethanolamine showed maximum values in the abdomen and the gonad. Glycolipid percentages were maximum in the abdomen, suggesting a structural role. The roles of the different lipid classes are discussed with respect to the function of the organ.																	0171-8630						1998	173						149	162		10.3354/meps173149							WOS:000077093600013

This was used with a Lagrangian model to investigate transport of Antarctic krill. Particle displacements from known krill spawning areas that result from surface Ekman drift, a composite large-scale now, and the combination of the two were calculated Surface Ekman drift alone only transports particles a few kilometres over the 150-day krill larval development time. The large-scale composite flow moves particles several hundreds of kilometres over the same time, suggesting this is the primary transport mechanism. An important contribution of the surface Ekman drift on particles released along the continental shelf break west of the Antarctic Peninsula is moving them north-northeast into the high-speed core of the southern Antarctic Circumpolar Current Front, which then transports the particles to South Georgia in about 140-160 days. Similar particle displacement calculations using surface now fields obtained from the Fine Resolution Antarctic Model do not show overall transport from the Antarctic Peninsula to South Georgia due to the inaccurate position of the southern Antarctic Circumpolar Current Front in the simulated circulation fields. The particle transit times obtained with the composite large-scale flow field are consistent with regional abundances of larval krill developmental stages collected in the Scotia Sea. These results strongly suggest that krill populations west of the Antarctic Peninsula provide the source for the krill populations found around South Georgia.

J	Saborowski, R				Saborowski, Reinhard			Related antipodes: a comparative study on digestive endopeptidases from Northern krill and Antarctic krill (Euphausiacea)	POLAR BIOLOGY												The Antarctic krill, Euphausia superba, and the Northern krill, Meganyctiphanes norvegica, are closely related species but occupy significantly different trophic and climatic environments. E. superba holds a key position as a phytoplankton grazer in the Southern Ocean. The omnivorous M. norvegica is an important member of plankton communities in the Northeast Atlantic. Both species expressed high proteolytic activities which were dominated by serine proteinases. In the stomachs of Antarctic krill, activities of total proteinase, trypsin, and chymotrypsin were significantly higher than in Northern krill. In the midgut glands, however, total proteinase and trypsin activities were similar in both species, but chymotrypsin activity was significantly higher in Antarctic krill. Moreover, Antarctic krill expressed four trypsin isoforms while only one isoform appeared in Northern krill. Chymotrypsin was present in either species as one single isoform. Antarctic krill adapted to the low and patchy distribution of food by elevated enzyme activities and the expression of trypsin isoforms with slightly different catalytic properties. Presumably, these enzymes facilitate in concerted action the efficient utilization of proteins from phytoplankton, the major food. Northern krill, in contrast, seems not to be equipped to face food limitation. It expresses a "simple" or "basic" set of digestive enzymes for utilizing abundant and easily digestible prey.

TIME AND TEMPERATURE-DEPENDENCE DURING THE DESCENT ASCENT CYCLE	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART A-OCEANOGRAPHIC RESEARCH PAPERS												A time- and temperature-dependent model was developed to simulate the descent-ascent behavior of the embryos and early larval stages of the Antarctic krill, Euphausia superba. This model combines laboratory measurements of temperature effects on developmental times, density and physiology of krill embryos and larvae and the observed water temperature structure in the Bransfield Strait-South Shetland Islands region. Simulations with observed vertical temperature profiles from this region show that embryos that develop at temperatures less than 0-degrees-C hatch relatively deep (almost-equal-to 1000 m) or hit the bottom before hatching. The presence of warm (1-2-degrees-C) Circumpolar Deep Water (CDW), between 200 and 700 m, results in hatching depths of about 700 m. The sinking rate pattern characteristic of the embryos of Euphausia superba retains the embryos in the CDW, where development is accelerated. Larval ascent rate through the CDW is rapid, so larvae reach the surface before metamorphosing into the first feeding stage, and have sufficient carbon reserves to drift at the surface for several weeks before needing to find food. These results suggest that the sinking rate pattern characteristic of embryos of Antarctic krill may be part of a reproductive strategy that evolved in response to the thermal structure of its environment. The complementary component of this reproductive strategy is the observed correlation between the distribution of krill schools containing reproducing individuals and the presence of CDW. With this reproductive strategy, the spawning regions of Antarctic krill are in areas where oceanic conditions enhance the probability of survival of its embryos and non-feeding larvae.																	0198-0149					JUL-AUG	1992	39	7-8A					1177	1200		10.1016/0198-0149(92)90063-Y							WOS:A1992JH54000008

It is, however, very important that the resource is utilized in a sustainable manner in terms of efficiency and selectivity, which can be enhanced through proper design of pelagic trawls that are used for harvesting the species. Pelagic trawls rely heavily on hydrodynamic forces acting on the netting to form desirable shapes. It is thus crucial to understand hydrodynamic forces acting on the trawl to predict its performance. A large Antarctic krill trawl with a net opening circumference of 200 m was designed for a fishing vessel (2855 kW) and analyzed by numerical simulation and physical model tests. A numerical model of Antarctic krill trawl was established based on the finite element method. The principle of minimum potential energy was employed to determine the equilibrium configuration and the tension distribution of the trawl in a uniform current. The Newton-Raphson method was applied to solve the equilibrium equation. A series of physical model tests were conducted in a flume tank to verify the result from numerical simulation. The results showed that the trawl with a net opening circumference of 200 m had superior hydrodynamic performance and could be well matched with fishing vessels of the class for the efficient production of Antarctic krill. This paper demonstrates the use of scientific methods for the design of large Antarctic krill trawls and the application of numerical simulation to study the hydrodynamic performance.																	0029-8018					MAY 1	2019	179						173	179		10.1016/j.oceaneng.2019.03.022							WOS:000466453800015						
J	CAPELLA, JE; QUETIN, LB; HOFMANN, EE; ROSS, RM				CAPELLA, JE; QUETIN, LB; HOFMANN, EE; ROSS, RM			MODELS OF THE EARLY LIFE-HISTORY OF EUPHAUSIA-SUPERBA .2. LAGRANGIAN CALCULATIONS	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART A-OCEANOGRAPHIC RESEARCH PAPERS												A three-dimensional time-dependent model of the circulation in the Bransfield Strait-South Shetland Islands region and a physiologically-based, temperature-dependent model of the descent-ascent behavior of the embryos and larvae of Euphausia superba were combined in a Lagrangian particle tracing model to simulate trajectories of krill embryos and larvae. The Lagrangian calculations show that: (1) surface flow is the primary factor influencing the final location of the embryo-larva particle: and (2) timing of krill spawning affects the eventual position of the feeding larvae. Seasonal changes in the wind stress field result in variability in direction and velocity of surface currents, which affects the embryo-larva trajectories. Conditions favourable for the transport of larvae to Bransfield Strait occur early in the spawning season. East of the Antarctic Peninsula larvae have a greater probability of entering Bransfield Strait if the krill embryos are released in mid-summer, January to February. Embryos released to the north of the South Shetland Islands. west of 62-degrees-W are transported into Drake Passage. Embryos released to the north of the South Shetland Islands and east of Livingston Island are transported westward where they can eventually enter Bransfield Strait. Krill larvae also are transported into Bransfield Strait from the Bellingshausen and Weddell Seas. The Lagrangian trajectories show that the western Bransfield Strait is a region of potentially high larval concentration due to transport from surrounding areas as well as local production. This is in agreement with observed krill larvae distributions, which show higher concentrations in this region.																	0198-0149					JUL-AUG	1992	39	7-8A					1201	1220		10.1016/0198-0149(92)90064-Z							WOS:A1992JH54000009

Antarctic Krill Are Reservoirs for Distinct Southern Ocean Microbial Communities	FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY												Host-associated bacterial communities have received limited attention in polar habitats, but are likely to represent distinct nutrient-rich niches compared to the surrounding environment. Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) are a super-abundant species with a circumpolar distribution, and the krill microbiome may make a substantial contribution to marine bacterial diversity in the Southern Ocean. We used high-throughput sequencing of the bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA gene to characterize bacterial diversity in seawater and krill tissue samples from four locations south of the Kerguelen Plateau, one of the most productive regions in the Indian Sector of the Southern Ocean. Krill-associated bacterial communities were distinct from those of the surrounding seawater, with different communities inhabiting the moults, digestive tract and faecal pellets, including several phyla not detected in the surrounding seawater. Digestive tissues from many individuals contained a potential gut symbiont (order: Mycoplasmoidales) shown to improve survival on a low quality diet in other crustaceans. Antarctic krill swarms thus influence Southern Ocean microbial communities not only through top-down grazing of eukaryotic cells and release of nutrients into the water column, but also by transporting distinct microbial assemblages horizontally via migration and vertically via sinking faecal pellets and moulted exuviae. Changes to Antarctic krill demographics or distribution through fishing pressure or climate-induced range shifts will also influence the composition and dispersal of Southern Ocean microbial communities.

Parameter estimation using randomized phases in an integrated assessment model for Antarctic krill	PLOS ONE												An integrated model assessing the status and productivity of Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba, hereafter krill) was configured to estimate different subsets of 118 potentially estimable parameters in alternative configurations. We fixed the parameters that were not estimated in any given configuration at pre-specified values. The model was fitted to over forty years of fisheries and survey data for krill in Subarea 48.1, a statistical reporting area around the Antarctic Peninsula used by the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR). The number of estimated parameters was gradually increased across model configurations. Configurations that estimated more parameters fitted the data better, but the order in which the parameters were estimated became more important in finding the best fit. Twenty-two configurations estimating from 48 to 107 parameters were able to obtain an invertible Hessian matrix that was subsequently used to estimate parameter uncertainty. Parameter uncertainties calculated using asymptotic approximation around the maximum likelihood estimates were often larger than uncertainties based on Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling for the same parameters. Diagnostics applied to MCMC samples in the best model of each configuration that obtained an invertible Hessian indicated that the most highly parameterized configurations did not reach stationary distributions. A 96-parameter configuration was the best fitting model of those that passed the MCMC diagnostics. The Delta AIC and Delta BIC scores indicated essentially no support relative to the best model for the alternative models that also passed MCMC diagnostics. Simulated data using the configurations as operating models showed that while all configurations passed "self-tests" for spawning biomass and recruitment, there was a small negative bias due to model penalties in the fishing mortality estimates for years with the highest fishing mortalities. "Cross-tests" of configurations that estimated different parameters often differed from the operating model values.																	1932-6203					AUG 17	2018	13	8							e0202545	10.1371/journal.pone.0202545							WOS:000442282700033	30118523

Persistent organohalogen contaminant burdens in Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) from the eastem Antarctic sector: A baseline study	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												A baseline for persistent organohalogen compound (POC) accumulation in the Antarctic keystone species, Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) has been established fora 50 degrees longitudinal range of the eastern Antarctic sector. Samples of adult krill, caught from 12 sites distributed between 30 degrees and 80 degrees E (60-70 degrees S), were analysed for > 100 organohalogen compounds including chlorinated pesticides, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polybrominated organic compounds and polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins/furans (PCDD/Fs). Organochlorine pesticides dominated measured krill contaminant burdens with hexachlorobenzene (HCB) as the single most abundant compound quantified. Krill HCB concentrations were comparable to those detected at this trophic level in both the Arctic and temperate northwest Atlantic, lending support for the hypothesis that HCB will approach global equilibrium at a faster rate than other POCs. Para, para'-dichlorodiphenylethene (p,p'-DDE) was detected at notable concentrations. Measurements of DDT and its degradation products provide an important baseline for monitoring the temporal and geographical influence of renewed, DDT usage for malaria-control in affected southern hemisphere countries. In contrast to the Arctic, PCBs did not feature prominently in contaminant burdens of Antarctic krill. The major commercial polybrominated diphenyl ether (PBDE) congeners -99 and -47 were quantified at low background levels with clear concentration spikes observed at around 70 degrees E, in the vicinity of modem, active research stations. The likelihood that local anthropogenic activities are supplementing low PBDE levels, delivered otherwise primarily via long range environmental transport, is discussed. The suspected naturally occurring brominated organic compound, 2,4,6-tribromoanisole (TBA), was a ubiquitous contaminant in all samples whereas the only PCDD/Fs quantifiable were trace levels of octachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (OCDD) and 1,2,3,4,7,8/1,2,3,4,7,9-hexachlorodibenzofuran (HxCDF). With the aims of, i) Generating a robust and broadly applicable POC auditing platform for the scarcely studied eastern Antarctic sector; ii) Determining the compounds accumulating in Antarctic krill for further toxicity evaluation studies and iii) Establishing a baseline for Antarctic predator exposure to POCs, this study represents one of the most comprehensive reports of POC contamination of the Antarctic food web to date.

In this study, Antarctic krill was treated with dandelion polysaccharide (DP) and stored frozen at -8 degrees C for 12 months. The changes in thiobarbituric acid reactants (TBARs), peroxide values (PVs), free fatty acid (FFA) content, fatty acid composition and sensory quality score were evaluated. Treatment with DP maintained the PV, TBAR and FFA contents and sensory quality score and increased the unsaturated fatty acid contents.

Sex ratios of krill vary remarkably between swarms and this phenomenon is poorly understood, as identification of krill sex relies on external morphological differences that appear late during development. Sex determination mechanisms in krill are unknown, but could include genetic, environmental or parasitic mechanisms. Similarly, virtually nothing is known about molecular sex differentiation. The krill genome has to date not been sequenced, and due to its enormous size and large amount of repetitive elements, it is currently not feasible to develop sex-specific DNA markers. To produce a reliable molecular marker for sex in krill and to investigate molecular sex differentiation we therefore focused on identifying sex-specific transcriptomic differences. Through transcriptomic analysis, we found large gene expression differences between testes and ovaries and identified three genes exclusively expressed in female whole krill from early juvenile stages onwards. The sex-specific expression of these three genes persisted through sexual regression, although our regressed samples originated from a krill aquarium and may differ from wild-regressed krill. Two slightly male-biased genes did not display sufficient expression differences to clearly differentiate sexes. Based on the expression of the three female-specific genes we developed a molecular test that for the first time allows the unambiguous sex determination of krill samples lacking external sex-specific features from juvenile stages onwards, including the sexually regressed krill we examined.

J	Thomson, RB; Butterworth, DS; Boyd, IL; Croxall, JP				Thomson, RB; Butterworth, DS; Boyd, IL; Croxall, JP			Modeling the consequences of Antarctic krill harvesting on Antarctic fur seals	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS												In terms of the convention governing the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR), management advice for the Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) fishery should take the needs of the predators of krill into account in order to reduce the risk of deleterious impacts on such predators (e.g., baleen whales and numerous fish, seal, penguin, and flying bird species). A single species yield model is currently being used by the CCAMLR Scientific Committee to recommend an annual krill catch limit, which is expressed as a proportion (gamma = 0.116) of a survey biomass estimate. This approach takes the needs of predators into account in only a crude way by assuming that a median krill escapement of 75% of its unexploited biomass would be sufficient to meet the needs of predators. A krill-predator modeling procedure is presented that could be used to directly assess the impact of krill harvesting on krill predator populations and therefore to revise this recommended harvesting level (gamma) for Antarctic krill. Application of a deterministic form of this model to an Antarctic fur seal (Arctocephalus gazella) data set from Bird Island, South Georgia, Antarctica, indicates that the level of krill fishing intensity (gamma) that would reduce this population to half the equilibrium size in the absence of krill fishing (gamma (half)) lies between 0.03 and 0.18, which includes the level recommended by CCAMLR. This large range results primarily from the sensitivity of the model to the maximum growth rate parameter, for which a range of 5-15%/yr is investigated. A plausible range of values for this parameter (5-15%/yr) results in estimated gamma (half) values from 0.04 to 0.23. Stochastic calculations (which take account of interannual fluctuations in the abundance of the krill population due to recruitment variability) yield higher estimated gamma (half) values than the less realistic deterministic calculations. However, simulation tests indicate that the estimated gamma (half) values are biased upward; this modeling approach is therefore likely to yield gamma (half) values that would lead to a depletion of the Antarctic fur seal population to more than half its pristine size.

Due to its central position in the food web, Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) is a key species of the marine Antarctic ecosystem. It is therefore crucial to understand how increasing water temperatures affect important krill life-cycle processes. Here, a long-term (August - March) laboratory acclimation experiment at different temperature scenarios (0.5 degrees C, 1.5 degrees C, 2.5 degrees C, 3.5 degrees C, 5 degrees C, 7 degrees C) was performed and the effects of elevated temperatures on whole animal parameters (O2 consumption, body length, length of the digestive gland) were analyzed. The response of krill oxygen consumption to different experimental temperatures differed between acute/short-term and long-term acclimation. After 8 months, krill oxygen consumption remained unchanged up to temperatures of 3.5 degrees C and was significantly higher at temperatures > 3.5 degrees C. Krill acclimated to temperatures > 3.5 degrees C were significantly smaller at the end of the experiment. Limited food intake and/or conversion may have contributed to this effect, especially pronounced after the onset of the reproductive period. In addition, the seasonal growth pattern in males differed from that of females. Together, our findings indicate that warming Southern Ocean waters are likely to increase metabolic rate in krill, possibly altering the amount of energy available for other important life-cycle processes, a finding directly related to future population dynamics and fisheries management.

The high concentrations of the species and its possible uses-food for human and animal consumption and in the production of industrial, pharmaceutical and dietetic products-generates interest in the fishing industry. Its relevance motivated the implementation of administrative measures and international regulations for this fishery, which are summarized in this review. Chile is the only South American fishing country that has shown interest in participating in Antarctic krill fishery. Thus, between 1983 and 1994, the Fisheries Development Institute and some companies carried out fishing activities mainly aimed at prospecting and researching this species. However, starting in 2011, the factory trawler FV Betanzos began sustained commercial krill fishing aimed at krill meal production. This document analyzes the information collected by said vessel between 2011 and 2016, including areas of operation, fishing depth catches and CPUE obtained. Also, the main challenges faced by this fishery and the actions planned as solutions are assessed.																	0718-560X	0717-7178					2020	48	2					179	196		10.3856/vol48-issue2-fulltext-2408							WOS:000532474500002

Brynn			Modeling the transport and fate of euphausiids in the Ross Sea	POLAR BIOLOGY					11th Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research Symposium	JUL 16-19, 2013	Barcelona, SPAIN					Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) and crystal krill (Euphausia crystallorophias), important components of the Ross Sea food web, differ in their population distribution. The objective of this study was to determine whether these differing distributions result primarily from differences in spawning locations, larval development times, and transport by the Ross Sea circulation. To address this objective, Lagrangian particle tracking experiments were used to simulate the transport of larvae of Antarctic krill and crystal krill. The particle simulations showed that regions providing inputs of Antarctic krill to the Ross Sea were along the outer shelf/slope. Crystal krill transport and retention were along the shallow banks on the outer Ross Sea shelf. Particles initialized in the inner shelf off Victoria Land showed high retention in the region south and along the Terra Nova Bay polynya, with timescales consistent with development times of crystal krill. These results suggest that the cyclonic circulation over the shelf contributes significantly to the dispersion and retention of crystal krill in parts of the inner Ross Sea continental shelf that overlaps with regions with high concentrations of krill-dependent top predators. The westward circulation along the shelf break contributes to the transport and aggregation of Antarctic krill in regions where Circumpolar Deep Water is observed on the outer continental shelf and along the shelf break. The transport pathways and connectivity obtained from this study provide a baseline for assessing the effects of projected changes in the Ross Sea circulation on the distribution of two important krill species.

Stratified mean density and biomass estimated for the whole surveyed area from RMT-8 hauls were among the lowest recorded (3.3 individuals 1000 m-3 and 3.1 g 1000 m-3) confirming Prydz Bay as a low krill abundance area in the Southern Ocean. Age cohorts 1+ to 4+ were present, the size of the animals increased from south to north and juveniles were mostly found in surface waters near the pack-ice. Adults were in an active reproductive phase: 98% of the females were mated and 35% were ready to spawn whereas 86% of the males carried spermatophores. Breeding was taking place in oceanic waters over deep zones with the spawning season limited to January-April. Phytoplankton biomass was also very low in the area (mean of 29 mg Chl a m-2 in the upper 200 m) and currents speed low, never reaching 10 cm s-1. Krill distribution was strongly related to water circulation pattern but not related to phytoplankton distribution.																	0954-1020					SEP	1991	3	3					279	292		10.1017/S0954102091000342							WOS:A1991GD35500007

GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS												Overwintering of larvae underneath Antarctic pack ice is a critical stage in the life cycle of Antarctic krill. However, there are no circumpolar assessments of available habitat for larval krill, making it difficult to evaluate how climate change may impact this life stage. We use outputs from a circumpolar sea ice model, together with a set of simple assumptions regarding key habitat features, to identify possible regions of larval krill habitat around Antarctica during winter. We assume that the location and suitability of habitat is determined by both food availability and three-dimensional complexity of the sea ice. A comparison of the combined area of these regions under current conditions with a warm climate scenario indicates that while total areal sea ice extent decreases, there is a consistently larger area of potential larval krill habitat under warm conditions. These findings suggest that decreases in sea ice extent may not necessarily be detrimental for krill populations.

The time-dependent location of particles, which represent krill individuals, is determined by random diffusion, foraging activity, and movement induced by the presence of neighbours. Foraging activity is based on prescribed food conditions and is such that krill swim slower and turn more frequently in areas of high food concentration. The presence or absence of neighbours either disperses krill, if the local concentrations become too dense, or coalesces krill, if concentrations become too dilute, respectively. Predation on krill is included and affects swarm characteristics by removing individuals. Sensitivity studies indicate that the rate of krill swarm formation and the total number of swarms formed are determined primarily by foraging response and nearest neighbour sensing distance. Simulations using food distributions that are representative of those encountered at boundaries, such as fronts, mesoscale eddies, or the sea ice edge, show that foraging activity can produce rapid swarm formation. Results from other krill swarm models show that attraction between individuals is the primary mechanism producing krill swarms. However, the parameterizations for krill interactions used in those models and that used in this model differ, thereby implying different biological dynamics. Thus, parameterization of the basic interactions it) krill swarm models remains to be defined. (C) 2004 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The impacts of this change can be seen in these ecosystems from primary producers to top predators, through biological, chemical and physical systems. We apply a Lagrangian particle tracking method to investigate transport processes from the retreating sea ice edge in the Southern Ocean during spring and summer. The resulting distribution of surface krill patches is used as a case study for our modelling approach. Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba), a secondary producer, plays a key role in the Southern Ocean ecosystems. Antarctic krill are highly abundant in the Southern Ocean with a complex distribution pattern both in the horizontal and vertical dimensions. Observations dating back to the 1930s show that juvenile krill often form surface patches - high density clusters of krill at the ocean surface - throughout the Southern Ocean during the spring and summer seasons. We develop a hypothesis, based on historical observations, that surface krill patches composed of juvenile krill move passively with ocean currents after their release from the sea ice edge zone in spring. Applying this hypothesis and method to the Southern Hemisphere spring/summer, leads to results that indicate that the observed changes in distribution of krill patches from historical to contemporary records could be related to the southward shift of the sea ice edge over the last century.

The method requires a simple sample clean-up procedure to remove the interfering Cl- from the hydrochloric acid extraction solution. The optimum extraction conditions of fluoride from Antarctic krill samples were obtained by adding 8mL of 1:11(v/v) hydrochloric acid solution and extracting for 60 min. Under these conditions, recoveries of fluoride from Euphausia superba and Penaeus vannamei were 97.9-105.6% and 95.1-101.9%, respectively. The limit of detection was 0.01mg/kg.

J	Siegel, V; Harm, U				Siegel, V; Harm, U			The composition, abundance, biomass and diversity of the epipelagic zooplankton communities of the southern Bellingshausen Sea (Antarctic) with special reference to krill and salps	ARCHIVE OF FISHERY AND MARINE RESEARCH												Zooplankton was sampled in the southern Bellingshausen Sea with RMT 1+8 gear during austral summer 1994. A total of 121 zooplankton species were found. Although zooplankton diversity was high in oceanic and neritic waters, abundances and biomass were among the lowest recorded for Antarctic epipelagic zooplankton. Copepods and chaetognaths dominated numerically, while chaetognaths and krill Euphausia superba dominated in biomass wet weight. Salpa thompsoni occurred in low densities (median 0.1 to 0.4/1000 m(3)), although during the same period a mass development was recorded from the South Shetland Island region. Density values for Euphausia crystallorophias were in the same range as reported from the southern Weddell Sea. Krill, Euphausia superba, biomass was lower than generally found in the Antarctic Peninsula and Elephant Island region. A distinct spatial separation for size groups was observed for salps, Euphausia crystallorophias and krill. Small salp size groups dominated in the East Wind Drift zone and larger ones further north under the influence of West Wind Drift waters. Larger size classes of E. crystallorophias concentrated in nearshore areas. Krill was smaller in neritc and larger in oceanic waters. The overall krill length frequency distribution was similar to that reported from the South Shetland Island region for the same period. The recruitment index for E. crystallorophias and Thysanoessa macrura age group 1+ indicated a very successful year-class 1992/93 in the region (R(1) = 0.412 and R(1) = 0.609, respectively), while krill showed the opposite, a poor recruitment of the 1992/93 year class (R(1) = 0.076). Spawning was late during the 1994 season for E. crystallorophias and E. superba; no larvae were found in the area. These findings are discussed in the light of recently described correlations between winter sea-ice conditions and krill spawning and recruitment success, and lead to the conclusion that recruitment of the 1993/94 krill year-class will be poor.																	0944-1921						1996	44	1-2					115	139									WOS:A1996VV96000008						
J	Kinzey, D; Watters, GM; Reiss, CS				Kinzey, Douglas; Watters, George M.; Reiss, Christian S.			Estimating recruitment variability and productivity in Antarctic krill	FISHERIES RESEARCH												Three alternative forms of the spawner-recruit relationship - the Beverton-Holt and two expressions of the Ricker function - and a fourth form representing annual recruitment deviations without an explicit relationship to spawning biomass, were applied in an integrated assessment model for Antarctic krill. Model data were from the international krill fishery and U.S. AMLR surveys in the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR) Subarea 48.1, the area around the Antarctic peninsula where the majority of recent fishing for krill has taken place. Sensitivity tests using pre-specified values for the standard deviation of the logarithm of annual recruitment residuals (sigma(R)) and productivity (steepness, h) for the relationship between spawning biomass and subsequent recruitment indicated that neither the Beverton-Holt nor Ricker functions were superior to configurations of the model that did not assume a spawner-recruit relationship. As the predictive power of the spawner-recruit functions was reduced by increasing the value of sigma(R) the fit to the data improved. All the functions fitted the data best when sigma(R) was large enough so that random recruitment with respect to spawning biomass was produced. The alternative functions produced the same time series of recruitment and spawning biomass estimates when they were determined by the data rather than forced towards an assumed relationship. Although the Beverton-Holt and Ricker models were poor predictors of the data, cross correlations of the recruitment predictions with the spawning biomass predictions from the best models indicated that recruitment was statistically correlated with spawning biomasses in the previous two to four years. The highest correlation (0.58) was with spawning biomass three years previously. Correlations in the reverse direction, with spawning biomass following recruitment were insignificant. These results suggest that recruitment variability does not influence subsequent spawning biomass in krill. They leave open the possibility that krill spawning biomass could influence subsequent recruitment, but not as modeled in the Beverton-Holt or Ricker functions with a one-year lag and the pre-specified von Bertalanffy growth.																	0165-7836	1872-6763				SEP	2019	217				SI		98	107		10.1016/j.fishres.2018.09.027							WOS:000473841400010

BHT was separated from the volatile oil of Antarctic krill using high performance thin layer chromatography (HPTLC) with petroleum ether/ethyl acetate/hexane (4:1:0.5, v/v/v) was used as the developing solvent. The content of BHT in volatile oil was 9.20mg/g and the content of BHT in dried Antarctic krill was 0.35mg/g (0.070mg/g in frozen whole Antarctic krill). The linearity, accuracy, stability, and recovery of the analysis showed that HPTLC is the most suitable method for the determination of BHT in Antarctic krill. The BHT crude sample was obtained by scraping the separated spot in the thin layer chromatography plate, which was then analyzed using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The resulting sample was identified with 96.05% purity based on the HPLC analysis. The structure of BHT was determined using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The results of the HPLC and GC-MS analysis validated the HPTLC method. BHT is a widely used antioxidant in food, pharmaceuticals, and in industrial production. The exploitation and utilization of BHT in Antarctic krill is of great economic value.																	1082-6076	1520-572X					2017	40	14					725	731		10.1080/10826076.2017.1357570							WOS:000415802300003

After the termination of a previous study, broodstock from the experimental lots fed on raw fish, moist pellets and soft-dry pellets were separately kept on a commercial SDP for about 5 months. Thereafter, the fish which had been fed entirely on SDP were offered a test diet without krill meal supplementation; whereas broodstock which had been fed moist pellets or raw fish were fed test diets containing 20 and 30% krill meal, respectively; all for about 5 months prior to spawning. The total egg production, the hatching rate among the fertilized eggs and the rate of normal larvae were the highest in the eggs obtained from the brood fish fed SDP without krill meal supplementation; these figures decreased relatively with the increase of krill meal in the diets. The rates of buoyant and fertilized eggs among the total eggs produced were not markedly different. It appears that higher levels of krill meal in the SDP was not beneficial for yellowtail brood fish.

Experimental determination of reflectance spectra of Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) in the Scotia Sea	ANTARCTIC SCIENCE												Antarctic krill are the dominant metazoan in the Southern Ocean in terms of biomass; however, their wide and patchy distribution means that estimates of their biomass are still uncertain. Most currently employed methods do not sample the upper surface layers, yet historical records indicate that large surface swarms can change the water colour. Ocean colour satellites are able to measure the surface ocean synoptically and should theoretically provide a means for detecting and measuring surface krill swarms. Before we can assess the feasibility of remote detection, more must be known about the reflectance spectra of krill. Here, we measure the reflectance spectral signature of Antarctic krill collected in situ from the Scotia Sea and compare it to that of in situ water. Using a spectroradiometer, we measure a strong absorption feature between 500 and 550 nm, which corresponds to the pigment astaxanthin, and high reflectance in the 600-700 nm range due to the krill's red colouration. We find that the spectra of seawater containing krill is significantly different from seawater only. We conclude that it is tractable to detect high-density swarms of krill remotely using platforms such as optical satellites and unmanned aerial vehicles, and further steps to carry out ground-truthing campaigns are now warranted.																	0954-1020	1365-2079				AUG	2021	33	4					402	414	PII S0954102021000262	10.1017/S0954102021000262							WOS:000692212300008

This footage also provides evidence that mating can take place near the seafloor at depths of 400-700 m. This observation challenges the generally accepted concept of the pelagic lifestyle of krill.

J	HOSIE, GW				HOSIE, GW			DISTRIBUTION AND ABUNDANCE OF EUPHAUSIID LARVAE IN THE PRYDZ BAY REGION, ANTARCTICA	ANTARCTIC SCIENCE												In January 1985 a net sampling survey was carried out on the distribution and abundance of euphausiid larvae in the Prydz Bay region. Euphausia superba occurred in low abundance, probably due to sampling preceding the main spawning period. Thysanoessa macrura occurred thorughout the study area in consistently high abundance. Euphausia crystallorophias was marginally more abundant within its restricted range. Distinct north-south variations in larval age and developmental stages of T. macrura were observed indicating regional differences in spawning. Euphausia frigida was mainly confined to the upper 200 m of the antarctic Circumpolar Current. E. superba larvae produced north of the shelf break, between 70-degrees-83-degrees-E, moved north-east into the Antarctic Circumpolar Current. Larvae originating on the shelf moved rapidly west in the East Wind drift. E. crystallorophias has the same westward dispersion, but some larvae appeared to return eastward via the Prydz Bay Gyre and remain in the region. The data indicate that most E. superba larvae, providing they survive injurious cold temperature and food deprivation, will leave the area, suggests that Prydz Bay krill may not be a self maintaining stock.																	0954-1020					JUN	1991	3	2					167	180		10.1017/S0954102091000202							WOS:A1991FR41900005

Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) eat diatoms and recycle iron in surface waters when feeding. Baleen whales eat krill, and, historically, defecation by baleen whales could have been a major mechanism for recycling iron, if whale faeces contain significant quantities of iron. We analysed the iron content in 27 samples of faeces from four species of baleen whale. Faecal iron content (145.9 +/- 133.7 mg kg(-1)) is approximately ten million times that of Antarctic seawater, suggesting that it could act as a fertilizer. Furthermore, we analysed the iron content of seven krill species and of muscle tissue of two species of baleen whales; all samples had high iron levels. Using these figures, together with recent estimates of the range and biomass of krill, we calculate that the Antarctic krill population contains similar to 24% of the total iron in the surface waters in its range. Thus, krill can act as a long-term reservoir of iron in Antarctic surface waters, by storing the iron in their body tissue. Pre-exploitation populations of whales and krill must have stored larger quantities of iron and would have also recycled more iron in surface waters, enhancing overall ocean productivity through a positive feedback loop. Thus, allowing the great whales to recover might actually increase Southern Ocean productivity through enhancing iron levels in the surface layer.

Nanoplastics affect moulting and faecal pellet sinking in Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) juveniles	ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL												Plastic debris has been identified as a potential threat to Antarctic marine ecosystems, however, the impact of nanoplastics (< 1 mu m) is currently unexplored. Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) is a keystone species of Southern Ocean pelagic ecosystems, which plays a central role in the Antarctic food webs and carbon (C) cycle. Krill has been shown to rapidly fragment microplastic beads through the digestive system, releasing nanoplastics with unknown toxicological effects. Here we exposed krill juveniles to carboxylic (-COOH, anionic) and amino(-NH2, cationic) polystyrene nanoparticles (PS NPs) and we investigated lethal and sub-lethal endpoints after 48 h. The analysis of PS NP suspensions in Antarctic sea water (SW) media showed that PS-COOH formed large agglomerates (1043 +/- 121 nm), while PS-NH2 kept their nominal size (56.8 +/- 3 nm) during the exposure time. After 48 h, no mortality was found but increase in exuviae production (12.6 +/- 1.3%) and reduced swimming activity were observed in juveniles exposed to PS-NH2. The microbial community composition in SW supports the release of krill moults upon PS NP exposure and stimulates further research on the pivotal role of krill in shaping Southern Ocean bacterial assemblages. The presence of fluorescent signal in krill faecal pellets (FPs) confirmed the waterborne ingestion and egestion of PS-COOH at 48 h of exposure. Changes in FP structure and properties were also associated to the incorporation of PS NPs regardless of their surface charge. The effects of PS NPs on krill FP properties were compared to Control 0 h as a reference for full FPs (plastic vs food) and Control 48 h as a reference for more empty-like FPs (plastic vs lack of food). Exposure to PS NPs led to a FP sinking rate comparable to Control 48 h, but significantly lower than Control 0 h (58.40 +/- 23.60 m/d and 51.23 +/- 28.60 m/d for PS-COOH and PS-NH2; 168.80 +/- 74.58 m/d for Control 0 h). Considering the important role played by krill in the food web and C export in the Southern Ocean, the present study provides cues about the potential impact of nanoplastics on Antarctic pelagic ecosystems and their biogeochemical cycles.

Glider-Based Estimates of Meso-Zooplankton Biomass Density: A Fisheries Case Study on Antarctic Krill (Euphausia superba) Around the Northern Antarctic Peninsula	FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE												We compare estimates of krill density derived from gliders to those from contemporaneous and previous ship-based surveys. Our comparisons cover several temporal and spatial scales within two strata around the northern Antarctic Peninsula (off Cape Shirreff on the north side of Livingston Island and in the Bransfield Strait). Our objective is to explore the feasibility of using gliders to supplement or replace vessel-based surveys of fishery resources. We deployed two long-duration Slocum G3 gliders manufactured by Teledyne Webb Research (TWR), each equipped with a suite of oceanographic sensors and a three-frequency (38, 67.5, and 125 kHz, each single-beam) Acoustic Zooplankton Fish Profiler. We used the acoustic data collected by these gliders to estimate biomass densities (g.m(-2)) of Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba). The two gliders were, respectively, deployed for 82 and 88 days from mid-December 2018 through mid-March 2019. Off Cape Shirreff, glider-based densities estimated from two repeat small-scale surveys during mid-December and January were 110.6 and 55.7 g.m(-2), respectively. In Bransfield Strait, the glider-based estimate of biomass density was 106.7 g.m(-2) during December-January. Contemporaneous ship-based estimates of biomass density, from a multi-ship broad-scale krill survey (Macaulay et al., 2019) restricted to the areas sampled by the gliders, were 84.6 g.m(-2) off Cape Shirreff and 79.7 g.m(-2) in Bransfield Strait during January. We compared two alternative krill-delineation algorithms (dB differencing and SHAPES); differences between biomass densities estimated by applying these algorithms were small and ranged between 4 and 7%. Alternative methods of sampling krill length-frequency distributions (LFDs) (nets or predator diets), which are required to convert acoustic energy to biomass density, also influenced the glider-based results. In Bransfield Strait, net-based estimates of biomass density were 6% less than those based on predator diets. Off Cape Shirreff the biomass density of krill estimated from a net-based LFD was 20% greater than that based on predator diets. Development of a variance estimator for glider-based biomass surveys is ongoing, but our results demonstrate that fisheries surveys using acoustically-equipped gliders are feasible, can provide density estimates to inform management, and may be conducted at lower cost than ship surveys in some cases.																		2296-7745				MAR 25	2021	8								604043	10.3389/fmars.2021.604043							WOS:000637885500001						
J	Miller, DGM				Miller, DGM			Antarctic krill and ecosystem management - From Seattle to Siena	CCAMLR SCIENCE												This paper outlines CCAMLR's development of a management approach for the Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) fishery and associated ecosystem component between 1984 and 1995. The approach is shown to be consistent with the objectives of the CAMLR Convention, particularly its Article II. Emphasis is given to the initiation of the CCAMLR Ecosystem Monitoring Program (CEMP) and the deliberations of the Working Group on Krill (WG-Krill). Particular prominence is also attached to the modelling approach developed in order to calculate a precautionary catch limit for the krill fishery in various CCAMLR statistical areas. This paper complements those of Constable (2002 - this volume) and Everson (2002 - this volume), with the three papers documenting developments during CCAMLR's first 20 years of existence.																	1023-4063						2002	9						175	212									WOS:000179438500014

Identifying sea-ice characteristics that serve as indicators of habitat quality will be crucial to the monitoring and management of climate change impacts. In the Southern Ocean, Antarctic krill is a key prey species and fishery target. Krill larvae depend upon sea-ice habitats to survive the winter and recruit to the population in spring. Existing observations of sea-ice characteristics lack sufficient spatiotemporal coverage to quantify which ones contribute to favourable overwintering habitat, leading to uncertainties in how current and future changes in sea ice affect krill populations. Here, we derive regional-scale indices of annual krill recruitment spanning 35 years across the southwest Atlantic. To develop meaningful indicators of sea-ice habitat, we selected variables from a high-resolution sea-ice model that are hypothesized as relevant for larval habitat use. The resulting correlations between recruitment and sea-ice indicators vary by region and show remote connections to sea ice that correspond with established theories of larval transport. Through an improved representation of sea-ice habitat quality, as compared with using more traditional satellite-derived variables such as sea-ice extent and duration, we highlight plausible regions of overwintering habitat. Our findings improve current understanding of how krill are likely responding to changing sea ice and support emerging views that larval habitat use is complex. Furthermore, regional variation in larval dependence on sea ice may provide pockets of resilience to change for the broader krill population.																	1470-160X	1872-7034				OCT	2021	129								107934	10.1016/j.ecolind.2021.107934							WOS:000681691400001

Aim of the study was to evaluate the effect of Antarctic krill components on plasma lipids and atherosclerosis development. Methods and results: Sixty apoEKO mice were divided into four groups and fed Western diet (CONTROL) or Western-like diets, differing for protein or fat content. Specifically, casein or fat in CONTROL was partially replaced by krill proteins (PRO), krill oil (KRILL OIL), or both (KRILL OIL+ PRO). In KRILL OIL+ PRO and KRILL OIL, cholesterol levels were significantly lower than in CONTROL group. Atherosclerosis in aorta of PRO, KRILL OIL and KRILL OIL+ PRO was lower than in CONTROL, whereas, at the aortic sinus, atherosclerosis reduction was only observed in KRILL OIL. Liver steatosis, commonly present in CONTROL and PRO animals, was sporadic in KRILL OIL+ PRO and KRILL OIL mice. Krill oil containing diets affected the expression of genes involved in cholesterol metabolism, mainly HMG-CoA reductase. No reduced systemic inflammation was found in all groups. Conclusion: Krill oil containing diets were able to reduce cholesterol levels, inhibit plaque development and prevent liver damage. Krill proteins also reduced atherosclerosis development through mechanisms not involving lipid metabolism.

S	Tarling, GA; Fielding, S		Siegel, V		Tarling, Geraint A.; Fielding, Sophie			Swarming and Behaviour in Antarctic Krill	BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY OF ANTARCTIC KRILL	Advances in Polar Ecology											The behavioural ecology of Antarctic krill is dominated by their tendency to swarm. They form amongst the largest monospecific aggregations of biomass in the animal kingdom, with some swarms measuring up to 100 km(2) and containing 2 million tonnes of krill. Swarms come in a multitude of shapes and sizes, and a greater understanding of the functional attributes of different swarm types is starting to emerge. This chapter will consider the spectrum of krill-swarms and -schools that have been described and some of the latest approaches taken to understand their shape and formation. The fundamental needs to avoid predation, feed, mate and spawn have often been attributed to being a major influence on swarming and we will examine these behaviours and their wider impacts. This chapter also considers how krill position themselves in the water column, altering their depth over diel and seasonal cycles, with further levels of modification depending on the environmental context. The ability of krill to migrate large distances is a major ecological feature of the Southern Ocean ecosystem, affecting the productivity of both planktonic and upper-trophic level communities, and we consider how such migrations are driven at the level of the swarm. New technologies are emerging that are providing previously unreported krill behaviours and we assess the future potential of these technologies to develop an even deeper appreciation of krill ethology. Also, we assess what impact predicted changes to the Southern Ocean environment will have on krill behavioural traits.																	2468-5712		978-3-319-29279-3; 978-3-319-29277-9				2016							279	319		10.1007/978-3-319-29279-3_8	10.1007/978-3-319-29279-3						WOS:000401843300009

Antarctic krill shell (AKS) can be used as raw materials to prepare chitin. In this study, lactic acid and dispase were used to prepare Antarctic krill chitin (AKC-1). Amino-monosaccharide contents of chitin samples were detected by pre-column PMP-HPLC method. Analytical instruments were conducted to determine characteristics of chitin samples. Results showed that the amino-monosaccharide content of AKS was 4.62 g/100 g (measured in D-glucosamine). The yield of AKC-1 was 5.49 g/100 g, and the amino-monosaccharide content was 80.90 g/100 g. AKC-1 showed smooth flakes, a porous surface, and alpha-chitin structural characteristics. The maximum degradation temperature (DTG(max)) was 318.3 degrees C. The yield of deacetylated chitin (AKC-2) was 4.74 g/100 g, with deacetylation degree of 80.8%, viscosity average molecular weight of approximately 145.7 kDa, and amino-monosaccharide content of 97.06 g/100 g. The surface morphology of AKC-2 was similar to that of AKC-1, and the DTG(max) was 311.5 degrees C. A mild, eco-friendly chitin preparation method and an amino-monosaccharide content detection method of raw material before chitin preparation are described in this study, which can provide technical support for comprehensive utilization of Antarctic krill resources.

Euphausiid community structure and population structure of Euphausia superba off Adelie Land in the Southern Ocean during austral summer 2003, 2005 and 2008	POLAR SCIENCE												The distribution and community structure of euphausiids and the population structure of Euphausia superba were investigated mainly along 140 degrees E off Adelie Land in the Indian Ocean sector of the Southern Ocean during the austral summers of 2003, 2005 and 2008. Euphausiids were collected from six discrete depth layers, primarily between 0 and 2000 m, using an RMT 8 net. Euphausia frigida and Euphausia triacantha mainly occurred north of the Southern Boundary of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (SB) whereas E. superba was distributed south of the SB, and occurred abundantly in the continental slope area where Antarctic Winter Water was observed. E. frigida and E. triacantha occurred in the upper 200 m during the night whereas they were mainly found below 200 m during the daytime. Cluster analysis on stations suggested that the SB is an important biological boundary for euphausiid communities. The population structure of E. superba in 2003 was different from that of 2005 and 2008. While large mature individuals dominated in 2003, small immature krill (juveniles and subadult males) were more abundant in 2005 and 2008. Further sea-ice extension in the preceding winter in 2005 and 2008 likely provided favourable conditions for spawning and survival. A cluster analysis based on similarity of the maturity stages of E. superba revealed that mature males and gravid females (stage IIIC-E) were mainly distributed in the offshore area and mesopelagic zone, while juveniles and subadult males were found in the epipelagic zone of the continental slope area. Therefore, it is considered that E. superba migrates to the offshore area and mesopelagic zone as it grows. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. and NIPR. All rights reserved.

For Antarctic pack-ice seals, an important group of krill predators, we estimate the density and krill consumption in the West Antarctic Peninsula (WAP)-Western Weddell Sea area, the main fishery region; and we consider long-term changes in suitable pack-ice habitat, increased fishing pressure and potential krill declines based upon predictions from declines in sea ice cover. More than 3 million crabeater seals consumed over 12 million tonnes of krill each year. This was approximately 17% of the krill standing stock. The highest densities of pack ice seals where found in the WAP, including in its small-scale fishery management areas, where apparently suitable seal habitat has declined by 21-28% over a 30 year period, where krill density is likely to have declined, and fishing has increased. The highest seal density was found in the Marguerite Bay area which is a source of krill for the Antarctic Peninsula and elsewhere. Significant sea-ice loss since 1979 has already occurred, leading to open water and possible expansion for the fishery in the future. These factors may combine to potentially reduce food for pack ice seals. Therefore, high uncertainty in krill and seal stock trends and in their environmental drivers call for a precautionary management of the krill fishery, in the absence of survey data to support management based on specific conservation objectives for pack-ice seals.

J	Hofmann, EE; Lascara, CM				Hofmann, EE; Lascara, CM			Modeling the growth dynamics of Antarctic krill Euphausia superba	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												A time-dependent, size-structured, bioenergetically based model was developed to examine the growth dynamics of Antarctic krill Euphausia superba 2 to 60 mm in size. The metabolic processes included in the model are ingestion, a baseline respiration, respiratory losses due to feeding and digestion, and an activity-based respiration factor. The total of these processes, net production, was used as the basis for determining the growth or shrinkage of individuals. Size-dependent parameterizations for the metabolic processes were constructed from field and laboratory measurements. Environmental effects were included through time series of pelagic phytoplankton concentration that were derived from data sets collected west of the Antarctic Peninsula. Simulated growth rates during the spring and summer for all brill size classes were consistent with published growth rates; however, initial results indicated that winter shrinkage rates were too large. Although the use of a seasonally varying respiration activity factor (reduced winter respiration rates) resulted in winter shrinkage rates of adults that were consistent with observations of experimentally starved individuals, the annual change in length of specific size classes was still inconsistent with observations. Subsequent simulations examined the effect of ingestion of sea ice algae by krill in the late winter and early spring. The annual growth cycle best matched observations, particularly those for larval and subadult krill (<35 mm), when reduced winter respiration rates and ingestion of sea ice algae were both included. These results suggest that the ability of krill to exploit a range of food sources and reduced winter metabolism rates are the mechanisms that allow krill to successfully overwinter. The need for additional observations of krill physiological processes, especially during winter, is clearly indicated.																	0171-8630	1616-1599					2000	194						219	231		10.3354/meps194219							WOS:000086432600020						
J	Liu, F				Liu, Fei			A worldwide bibliometric analysis of Antarctic krill research during 1960 to 2015	CHINESE JOURNAL OF POPULATION RESOURCES AND ENVIRONMENT												This study conducted a bibliometric analysis of 1251 articles related to Antarctic krill from 1960 to 2015, based on the Core Collection in Thomson Reuters' Web of Science. We analyzed the results from four aspects: annual distribution, Web of Science categories and the major journals, international collaboration and author keywords. The Antarctic krill research has developed rapidly since 1978, with an increasing article output. The studies mostly focused on the fields of marine and freshwater biology, oceanography, and ecology. Polar Biology, Marine Ecology-Progress Series and Deep-Sea Research Part II-Topical Studies in Oceanography, were the top three journals to publish the Antarctic krill-related papers. Although Russia is the earliest state to report Antarctic krill, U.S.A. and England were leaders with the largest output quantity and the highest cooperation frequencies. The researches in PR China have taken a blooming since 2009 and will play a more and more important role in the world. The frequencies of author keywords were counted. The high-frequency keywords were further divided into four groups with cohesive subgroup analysis, which suggested the major themes. This paper depicts the existing publications on Antarctic krill. Our goal is to serve a point of reference and provide the direction for the future work.																	1004-2857	2325-4262					2017	15	4					357	364		10.1080/10042857.2017.1365453							WOS:000423924100009						
J	Han, XN; Liu, DC				Han, Xiangning; Liu, Daicheng			Quantitative Determination of Glycerol in Antarctic Krill (Euphausia superba Dana) by High-Performance Thin-Layer Chromatography	ACTA CHROMATOGRAPHICA												In this reported study, a direct high-performance thin-layer chromatographic (HPTLC) method was developed to qualitatively detect and quantitatively determine glycerol in Antarctic krill for the first time. This procedure was based on the extraction of glycerol by ultrasonic solvent extraction with anhydrous ethanol, silica-gel column chromatographic separation, HPTLC detection and quantification using methylene chloride-methanol (5:1, v/v) as the developing solvent and alkaline potassium permanganate as chromogenic agent. The content of glycerol was 1.3725 +/- 0.218 mg/g in freeze-dried Antarctic krill. The structure of glycerol in the Antarctic krill was subsequently determined by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) which verified the presence of the material in the krill. The HPTLC method exhibited excellent accuracy with a recovery of 90.1-103.3% and good precision with a relative standard deviation (RSD) of 1.59-4.84%. The results clearly exhibited the applicability of the proposed for quantifying glycerol in Antarctic krill.																	1233-2356	2083-5736				DEC	2018	30	4					274	277		10.1556/1326.2017.00298							WOS:000450760400012

Krill from contrasting growth regimes from early and late summer exhibited differences in RNA-based indices. There was a significant correlation between the independently measured individual growth rates and the RNA : DNA ratio and also the RNA concentration of krill tissue, although the strength of the relationship was only modest. DNA concentration, on average, was relatively constant, irrespective of the growth rates. The moult stage did not appear to have a significant effect on the nucleic acid contents of tissue. Overall, the amount of both nucleic acids varied considerably between individuals. Nucleic acid-based indicators may provide information concerning the recent growth and nutritional status of krill and further experimentation under controlled conditions is warranted. They are, however, reasonably costly and time-consuming measurements.

A new method was developed to extract and separate Antarctic krill PC. The PC was extracted only by acetone from Antarctic krill oil and separated by silica gel column chromatography mixtures of chloroform and methanol as eluting solvents. Thin-layer chromatography, high-performance liquid chromatography, and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy analyses were used to characterize the acetone-soluble Antarctic krill PC. The purity of the purified PC was able to reach 97.77 +/- A 0.65 %, which provided a reference basis for the preparation of standard Antarctic krill PC. Moreover, it was found in the fatty acid analysis that the purified PC contained mainly five fatty acids, including palmitic acid (41.25 %), oleic acid (8.62 %), 7-hexadecenoic acid (4.60 %), EPA (31.34 %), and DHA (14.52 %). The result is helpful for the analysis of Antarctic krill PC's molecular structures and the evaluation of its nutritional value.																	1438-2377	1438-2385				JUN	2014	238	6					1023	1028		10.1007/s00217-014-2178-z							WOS:000336269200013

Organic acids and the composition of amino acids in these fermented products were analyzed, as well as the sensory evaluation and taste components analysis. It was found that all four kinds of fermented liquor of Antarctic krill had better flavor, higher amino acid content, unique organic acid content, and higher antioxidant activity. The best flavor and the most abundant nutrition were in the Antarctic krill juice fermented by S. cerevisiae. The amino acid content was up to 1,368.30 mg/100 mL, the scavenging activity of 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radicals was 71.308%, and there was a variety of amino acids in this fermented liquor, which contained all eight of the essential amino acids not manufactured by the human body.																	1049-8850	1547-0636				NOV 17	2015	24	8					824	831		10.1080/10498850.2013.819056							WOS:000366360700009

In comparison with recent years the station grid was extended south, where a large proportion of small size classes, one-year-old juvenile krill was found. Results show a spatial separation of the juvenile krill and the spawning stock. Krill density was significantly higher than during the past years (229 krill 1000 m(-3) or 13.0 g m(-2)). The proportional recruitment index for the entire survey area for the 1999/2000 year class was R-1 = 0.573, which is among the highest values recorded during the past 20 years. The maturation index (based on the proportion of gravid stages) was G = 0.99, indicating an early initiation of the spawning season. The results indicate a turning point after a succession of years with poor recruitment success and low stock biomass. This is thought to be the first step for a successful spawning event and a later potential recruitment success of the 2000/01 year-class. The spatial extent of the station grid is discussed in the light of a representative coverage of the stock and the estimated recruitment index.																	0954-1020					JUN	2002	14	2					162	170		10.1017/S095410200200072X							WOS:000176315100008

Measurements of volume backscattering strength were used to describe the density of krill with depth and the vertical movement of krill over time. In situ measurements were made of dorsal aspect target strength (TS) and, as krill moved into the near-surface layer (0-15 m), in situ measurements were made of lateral-aspect TS. The probability density function (PDF) of TS measurements made with the down-looking transducer had a mode at approximately - 73 dB. The PDF of TS measurements made with the side-looking transducer was broader with a mode at approximately - 67 dB. Sampled krill had a bi-modal length distribution with a major mode at 44 mm and a minor mode at approximately 30 mm.

J	Watkins, JL; Murray, AWA; Daly, HI				Watkins, JL; Murray, AWA; Daly, HI			Variation in the distribution of antarctic krill Euphausia superba around south Georgia	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												There is considerable spatial structure within the South Georgia krill-based ecosystem in terms of predator demand, commercial fishery pressure and krill abundance. Here we investigate the hypothesis that there is also spatial structure in the krill population composition, finding differences in length-frequency histograms between the eastern and western ends of the island. Between 1981 and 1997 the British Antarctic Survey carried out 6 major cruises where krill were taken from both ends of South Georgia. Cluster analysis revealed that the length-frequency histograms could be grouped into 4 main types with relatively simple biological characteristics: Cluster 1 contained small krill (mean size 23.9 mm) up to 2 yr old (1+ yr class); Cluster 2 (mean size 31.1 mm) contained a mixture of 1+ with some 2+ and 3+ yr classes; Cluster 3 contained medium-sized krill (mean size 41.4 mm) probably 2+ and 3+ yr classes; Cluster 4 contained large krill (mean size 50.3 mm) likely to be 3+ or older. Principal components analysis (PCA) provided good separation of these clusters using the first 2 axes (80 % of the total variance). There were no obvious differences in the length composition of krill sampled from different water depths, although there were some indications that differences did occur between different water masses. Detailed inspection of the individual cruises revealed that the length-frequency histograms at the western end of the island contained more large krill than those from the eastern end of the island and also that when Weddell Sea water was found within a cruise then this contained the smallest krill. We consider that such differences may arise not only because krill may experience different conditions at each end of the island but also may originate from 2 separate sources which may have different population structures.																	0171-8630						1999	188						149	160		10.3354/meps188149							WOS:000084085700014

Pyrosequencing and de novo assembly of Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) transcriptome to study the adaptability of krill to climate-induced environmental changes	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY RESOURCES												The Antarctic krill, Euphausia superba, has a key position in the Southern Ocean food web by serving as direct link between primary producers and apex predators. The south-west Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean, where the majority of the krill population is located, is experiencing one of the most profound environmental changes worldwide. Up to now, we have only cursory information about krill's genomic plasticity to cope with the ongoing environmental changes induced by anthropogenic CO2 emission. The genome of krill is not yet available due to its large size (about 48 Gbp). Here, we present two cDNA normalized libraries from whole krill and krill heads sampled in different seasons that were combined with two data sets of krill transcriptome projects, already published, to produce the first knowledgebase krill master' transcriptome. The new library produced 25% more E.superba transcripts and now includes nearly all the enzymes involved in the primary oxidative metabolism (Glycolysis, Krebs cycle and oxidative phosphorylation) as well as all genes involved in glycogenesis, glycogen breakdown, gluconeogenesis, fatty acid synthesis and fatty acids -oxidation. With these features, the master' transcriptome provides the most complete picture of metabolic pathways in Antarctic krill and will provide a major resource for future physiological and molecular studies. This will be particularly valuable for characterizing the molecular networks that respond to stressors caused by the anthropogenic CO2 emissions and krill's capacity to cope with the ongoing environmental changes in the Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean.

Histopathology of Antarctic krill, Euphausia superba, bearing black spots	JOURNAL OF INVERTEBRATE PATHOLOGY					40th Annual Meeting of the Society-for-Invertebrate-Pathology	AUG 12-16, 2007	Quebec City, CANADA	Sov Invertebrate Pathol				Small black spots have been noticed on the cephalothorax of Antarctic krill, Euphausia superba, since January, 2001. To study the nature of the black spots, the krill were sampled in the winter of 2003, 2006, and 2007 in the South Georgia region, the Antarctic Ocean. Histological observations revealed that the black spots were melanized nodules that were composed of hemocytes surrounding either bacteria OF amorphous material. In the 2007 samples, 42% of the krill had melanized nodules. Most of the nodules had an opening on the body Surface of the krill. A single melanized nodule often contained more than one type of morphologically distinct bacterial cell. Three bacteria were isolated from these black spots, and classified into either Psychrobacter or Pseudoalteromonas based on the sequences of 16S rRNA genes. More than three bacterial species or strains were also confirmed by in situ hybridization for 16S rRNA. The melanized nodules were almost always accompanied by a mass of atypical, large heteromorphic cells, which were not observed in apparently healthy krill. Unidentified parasites were observed in some of the krill that had melanized nodules. These parasites were directly surrounded by the large heteromorphic cells. Histological observations suggested that these heteromorphic cells were attacking the parasites. These results suggest the possibility that the krill had been initially affected by parasite infections, and the parasitized spots were secondary infected by environmental bacteria after the parasites had escaped from the host body.

J	Quetin, LB; Ross, RM				Quetin, LB; Ross, RM			Episodic recruitment in Antarctic krill Euphausia superba in the Palmer LTER study region	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												As part of the Palmer Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) program, the size structure of the population of Antarctic krill found between Anvers and Adelaide Islands west of the Antarctic Peninsula has been analyzed for patterns in recruitment success. The data were from a series of 11 cruises, 1 in spring (November 199 1) and 10 in summer (January 1993 to January 2002). A maximum-likelihood fitting procedure was used to fit a mixture of normal distributions to the length-density distributions derived from net data. The recruitment index was calculated as the proportion of age-class 1 krill of the total. Antarctic krill in the Palmer LTER region showed a pattern of episodic recruitment, with 2 strong year classes in succession followed by 3 or 4 moderate or poor year classes. The 2 strong year classes represented 85 to 90% of the krill caught for 5 or 6 yr, and as the absolute abundance of the year class declined due to mortality, so did the abundance of Antarctic krill in the region. The recruitment index was positively correlated with the absolute value of a seasonal El Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) index, with strongest recruitment during the neutral or moderate periods of ENSO. The mechanism underlying the strong link between the recruitment index and ENSO is most likely the effects of seasonal sea-ice dynamics on both reproduction and winter-over survival of the resulting larvae as previously documented.																	0171-8630	1616-1599					2003	259						185	200		10.3354/meps259185							WOS:000186029000016

The purified enzyme (62.6 kDa; 2.62 unit/mg) was unstable at temperatures exceeding 30 degrees C. Denaturants, such as sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), guanidine HCl, and urea, were applied to evaluate the folding mechanism, including kinetics and thermodynamics, of krill ALP. Sodium dodecyl sulfate elicited no significant effect on ALP activity even at excessively high concentrations (300 mM), whereas guanidine HCl and urea effectively inactivated the enzyme at concentrations of 2 and 3.5 M, respectively. Kinetic studies showed that the enzymatic inhibition by guanidine HCl and urea represented a first-order reaction that was a monophasic unfolding process. This process was found to be associated with conformational changes without significant transient free-energy changes. Additionally, the overall structural changes occurred proximally to the active site pocket. Our study provides new insight into ALP of the Antarctic krill, which lives in extreme environmental conditions. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

J	Wang, F; Sheng, J; Chen, YX; Xu, JK				Wang, Fang; Sheng, Jun; Chen, Yixuan; Xu, Jiakun			Microbial diversity and dominant bacteria causing spoilage during storage and processing of the Antarctic krill, Euphausia superba	POLAR BIOLOGY												The Antarctic region is known for its ecological conditions and the presence of some of the rarest microorganisms on earth. Antarctic krill rapidly degrades while at rest or during transport due to high-activity enzymes in its flesh or from microbes. In this study, we analyzed the microbial diversity of the Antarctic krill, Euphausia superba, and identified the dominant bacteria that cause spoilage during storage and transport using culture-independent high-throughput sequencing and microbial pure culture methods. Antarctic krill samples were incubated at temperatures of 0 degrees C, 4 degrees C, 16 degrees C, and 25 degrees C to determine the microbial diversity and abundance in decaying marine krill samples. Metagenome high-throughput sequencing indicated that, under incubation at 4 degrees C and 0 degrees C for 24 h, the microbial diversity of the Antarctic krill samples was high, with high species richness of microbes adapted to the low-temperature environment, as indicated by the overwhelming dominance of Enterococcus and Bacillus. On the other hand, Psychrobacter became the dominant bacteria at storage temperatures of 16 degrees C and 25 degrees C. Quantitative PCR results demonstrated that the microbial copy number increased as the temperature increased from 0 to 25 degrees C, and the quantity of bacteria was much greater than that of fungi under the same storage conditions. Microbial pure culture methods demonstrated that Psychrobacter was the dominant genus at each incubation temperature after 24 h of storage. Psychrobacter sp. and Psychrobacter-like strains isolated from the Antarctic krill samples exhibited protease activity. Our laboratory results indicated that Psychrobacter was the primary cause of spoilage of the Antarctic krill, E. superba. The results from ITS rDNA fungal sequencing showed that unclassified Saccharomycetes were the predominant microbes in all the Antarctic krill samples.																	0722-4060	1432-2056				JAN	2021	44	1					163	171		10.1007/s00300-020-02789-x		JAN 2021					WOS:000607021300001

Combining a krill growth model with projected climate scenarios shows the growth habitat is likely to experience only moderate change, with the northern edges most at risk. Antarctic krill is a key species of important Southern Ocean food webs, yet how changes in ocean temperature and primary production may impact their habitat quality remains poorly understood. We provide a circumpolar assessment of the robustness of krill growth habitat to climate change by coupling an empirical krill growth model with projections from a weighted subset of IPCC Earth system models. We find that 85% of the study area experienced only a moderate change in relative gross growth potential (+/- 20%) by 2100. However, a temporal shift in seasonal timings of habitat quality may cause disjunctions between krill's biological timings and the future environment. Regions likely to experience habitat quality decline or retreat are concentrated near the northern limits of krill distribution and in the Amundsen-Bellingshausen seas region during autumn, meaning habitat will likely shift to higher latitudes in these areas.

JOURNAL OF GENETICS												Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) is a keystone species in the southern ocean ecosystem where it is the main consumer of phytoplankton and constitutes the main food item of many higher predators. Both food and predators are most abundant at the surface, thus krill hide in the depth of the ocean during the day and migrate to the upper layers at night, to feed at a time when the predatory risk is lowest. Although the functional significance of this diel vertical migration (DVM) is clear and its modulation by environmental factors has been described, the involvement of an endogenous circadian clock in this behaviour is as yet not fully resolved. We have analysed the circadian behaviour of Euphausia superba in a laboratory setting and here we present the first description of locomotor activity rhythms for this species. Our results are in agreement with the hypothesis that the circadian clock plays a key role in DVM. They also suggest that the interplay between food availability, social cues and the light:dark cycle acts as the predominant Zeitgeber for DVM in this species.

E.; Statscewich, Hank; Steinberg, Deborah K.; Winsor, Peter			Factors that affect the nearshore aggregations of Antarctic krill in a biological hotspot	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART I-OCEANOGRAPHIC RESEARCH PAPERS												Antarctic krill, Euphausia superba, is a highly abundant and ecologically important zooplankton species in the Southern Ocean. Regions of elevated Antarctic krill biomass exist around Antarctica, often as a result of the concentrating effect of bathyrnetry and ocean currents. Such areas are considered biological hotspots and are key foraging grounds for numerous top predators in the region. A hotspot of Antarctic krill biomass exists off the southern extent of Anvers Island, Western Antarctic Peninsula, and supports a population of Adelie penguins that feed almost exclusively on it, as well as numerous other top predators. We investigated the spatio-temporal variability in Antarctic krill biomass and aggregation structure over four consecutive summer seasons, identifying environmental factors that were responsible. We identified three distinct krill aggregation types (Large dense, Small-close and Small-sparse), and found that the relative proportion of each type to total aggregation numbers varied significantly between survey days. Large-dense aggregations occurred more frequently when westerly winds predominated and when the local mixed tide was in the diurnal regime. Small-close aggregations were also more frequent during diurnal tides and were negatively correlated with phytoplankton biomass. Small sparse aggregations, on the other hand, were more prevalent when the mixed tide was in the semi-diurnal phase. We suggest that, under certain conditions (i.e. diurnal tides and westerly winds), the biological hotspot in the nearshore waters off Palmer Station, Anvers Island, functions as a zone of accumulation, concentrating krill biomass. Our findings provide important information on the dynamics of Antarctic krill at the local scale.				schofield, oscar/H-4169-2018	schofield, oscar/0000-0003-2359-4131												0967-0637	1879-0119				AUG	2017	126						139	147		10.1016/j.dsr.2017.05.008							WOS:000408076600012						
J	Kokubun, N; Kim, JH; Takahashi, A				Kokubun, Nobuo; Kim, Jeong-Hoon; Takahashi, Akinori			Proximity of krill and salps in an Antarctic coastal ecosystem: evidence from penguin-mounted cameras	POLAR BIOLOGY												Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) and salps (mainly Salpa thompsoni) are main components of Southern Ocean ecosystem, but little is known about their coastal distribution at a fine scale (< 1 km). We deployed miniaturised cameras on breeding chinstrap (n = 9 birds) and gentoo penguins (n = 9 birds) in the Antarctic Peninsula region and obtained 2,333 krill images, 93 salp images and 609 sea floor images from 1,843 dives. 51.2 % of penguin dives that had salps present in the images occurred near the dives with krill images (within 5 min). The vertical distribution of salp images showed overlap with the upper depth zone of krill images. While 16.3 % of dives with krill images were associated in time with the sea floor, only 1.2 % of dives with salp images did. These results revealed close proximity between krill and salps within the penguin's foraging range in an Antarctic coastal ecosystem. These results also imply that krill patches were common in both pelagic and benthic habitat, whereas salps were common mainly in pelagic habitat. If the effects of deployments are similar between the years or regions, inter-annual or regional comparison using the penguin-mounted camera will be valid for characterising prey environment in the penguin foraging area.																	0722-4060	1432-2056				DEC	2013	36	12					1857	1864		10.1007/s00300-013-1400-y							WOS:000327393700015

To understand the flexibility of Antarctic krill's seasonal cycle, we investigated its physiological and behavioural responses to different light regimes and if an endogenous timing system was involved in the regulation of these seasonal processes. We analysed growth, feeding, lipid content, and maturity in a 2-year laboratory experiment simulating the latitudinal light regimes at 52 degrees S and 66 degrees S and constant darkness under constant food level. Our results showed that light regime affected seasonal cycles of growth, feeding, lipid metabolism, and maturity in Antarctic krill. Seasonal patterns of growth, feeding, and maturity persisted under constant darkness, indicating the presence of an endogenous timing system. The maturity cycle showed differences in critical photoperiods according to the simulated latitudinal light regime. This suggests a flexible endogenous timing mechanism in Antarctic krill, which may determine its response to future environmental changes.

J	Watkins, JL; Brierley, AS				Watkins, JL; Brierley, AS			Verification of the acoustic techniques used to identify Antarctic krill	ICES JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE												Acoustic surveys to estimate krill biomass require that the sound backscattered by krill can be identified and distinguished from all other types of backscatter. Sampling acoustic targets with nets to verify their identity have achieved this traditionally. More recently backscattered sound has been partitioned into krill or non-krill groups using differences in mean volume backscattering strength (MVBS) at two acoustic frequencies (DeltaMVBS = MVBS120 - MVBS38; where DeltaMVBS between 2 and 12 dB indicated krill). Here we compare net and acoustic data from two cruises around South Georgia in 1996 to assess the reliability of acoustic-based, target-identification techniques. MVBS data at 120 and 38 kHz were collected with a Simrad EK500 echosounder and net samples were collected with an RMT8. Around 80% of the echo integration cells from targets believed to be krill on the basis of their appearance on echo-charts, were also identified as krill from their difference in backscatter at 38 and 120 kHz. Krill biomass estimated from acoustic targets identified using echo-chart appearance or DeltaMVBS were broadly similar (regression: DeltaMVBS = 0.94 visual classification, r(2) = 0.99). Krill size was calculated from scattering models using the two frequency data and compared with that obtained in net hauls. This comparison revealed that a simplified bent-cylinder model was a better predictor of krill length than a fluid-filled, sphere model. We conclude that use of DeltaMVBS to identify Antarctic krill is advantageous because it is more objective than using echo-chart appearance.

Flexibility in Antarctic krill Euphausia superba decouples diet and recruitment from overwinter sea-ice conditions in the northern Antarctic Peninsula	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												Winter sea-ice conditions are considered important for Antarctic krill Euphausia superba survival and recruitment, yet few broad-scale longitudinal studies have examined the underlying relationships between winter conditions and krill recruitment. We used data from a 4 yr winter study of krill condition (lipid content), diet (stable isotopes and fatty acids), and length distributions around the northern Antarctic Peninsula to examine relationships among environmental variables (annual sea-ice cover, water column chlorophyll a [chl a], and upper mixed-layer water temperature), the condition and diet of krill, and recruitment success the following year. Diet indicators (lipid content, delta N-15, delta C-1(3), and the fatty acid ratios 16:1n-7/18:4n-3 and 18:1n-9/18:1n-7) in post-larvae were consistent among years regardless of sea-ice cover, suggesting that post-larval krill do not rely on sea-ice resources for overwinter survival. Diet indicators in larvae were more variable and suggest that larvae may feed on sea-ice resources when they are available but can still persist in the water column when they are not. Principal component analysis between environmental variables and diet indicators showed that water-column chl a was the only variable that significantly affected diet, regardless of annual changes in sea-ice cover. Extensive winter ice in one year did not translate into successful recruitment the following year. Krill demonstrate a high degree of flexibility with respect to overwinter habitat and diet, and the degree to which sea ice is important during different times of year and at different life stages may be more complex than previously thought.																	0171-8630	1616-1599				MAY 28	2020	642						1	19		10.3354/meps13325							WOS:000545930000001

The present work aimed to explore the effects of chitosan coating combined with sodium phytate (0.1% sodium phytate + 1% chitosan) on preserving Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) during partially frozen storage. Treatment of chitosan coating combined with sodium phytate significantly suppressed microbial growth, the increases in pH value, total volatile basic nitrogen and sensory deterioration of Antarctic krill (E. superba) during partially frozen storage. Therefore, chitosan coating combined with sodium phytate may be a practical method to suppress quality deterioration of Antarctic krill and thus extend its shelf life. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

The acoustic component of this survey was conducted using a scientific echosounder operating at 38 and 70 kHz to estimate the distribution and density of Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) and ice krill (E. crystallorophias). In addition, the relationship between the vertical distribution of Antarctic krill and the water temperature structure along the 140 degrees E meridian was investigated. Antarctic krill were distributed in the waters of the continental slope at 65-66 degrees S and the maximum value of the mean areal density rho in 1 nautical mile (nmi) intervals was 4344 inds. m(-2). Ice krill were distributed in the neritic waters of the continental shelf to the south of the 66 degrees S and the maximum rho in 1 nmi intervals was 23,669 inds. m(-2). Along the 140 degrees E meridian, Antarctic krill were mainly distributed at the water temperatures below 0.5 degrees C. Although they were mostly distributed shallower than approximately 100 m, dense aggregations at approximately 180-200 m were also observed, which coincided with a depression of the water temperature structure.

The details of the laboratory setup suitable for krill to school are described. Light intensity and food condition were found to affect krill swimming patterns and schooling behaviour. Krill swam in polarised groups and responded as a group to objects that produced sharp contrasts but not to less distinct objects. Schools broke up when they encountered dense phytoplankton patches, and aggregated more tightly when kept with a white featureless background. The diel nature of school formation was observed under simulated natural light conditions with stronger and tighter schools during daytime and no obvious schooling behaviour during night. These behavioural patterns are further discussed in terms of their costs and benefits of feeding and predation risk, in conjunction with the diel vertical migration behaviour of krill.

Antarctic krill eggs hatch in the aphotic zone up to 1000 m depth and larvae develop on their way to the ocean surface (development ascent) and are exposed to different quality (wavelength) and quantity (irradiance) of light. Adults show a daily vertical migration pattern, moving downward during the day and upward during the night within the top 200 m of the water column. Seawater acts as a potent chromatic filter and animals have evolved different opsin photopigments to perceive photons of specific wavelengths. We have investigated the transcriptome of E. superba and, using a candidate gene approach, we identified six novel opsins. Five are r-type visual opsins: four middle-wavelength-sensitive (EsRh2, EsRh3, EsRh4 and EsRh5) and one long-wavelength sensitive (EsRh6). Moreover, we have identified a non-visual opsin, the EsPeropsin. All these newly identified opsin genes were significantly expressed in compound eyes and brain, while only EsPeropsin and EsRh2 were clearly detected also in the abdomen. A temporal modulation in the transcription of these novel opsins was found, but statistically significant oscillations were only observed in EsRrh3 and EsPeropsin. Our results contribute to the dissection of the complex photoreception system of E. superba, which enables this species to respond to the daily and seasonal changes in irradiance and spectral composition in the Southern Ocean.

Antarctic krill Euphausia superba: spatial distribution, abundance, and management of fisheries in a changing climate	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												Antarctic krill Euphausia superba, a keystone species in the Southern Ocean, is highly relevant for studying effects of climate-related shifts on management systems. Krill provides a key link between primary producers and higher trophic levels and supports the largest regional fishery. Any major perturbation in the krill population would have severe ecological and economic ramifications. We review the literature to determine how climate change, in concert with other environmental changes, alters krill habitat, affects spatial distribution/abundance, and impacts fisheries management. Findings recently reported on the effects of climate change on krill distribution and abundance are inconsistent, however, raising questions regarding methods used to detect changes in density and biomass. One recent study reported a sharp decline in krill densities near their northern limit, accompanied by a poleward contraction in distribution in the Southwest Atlantic sector. Another recent study found no evidence of long-term decline in krill density or biomass and reported no evidence of a poleward shift in distribution. Moreover, with predicted decreases in phytoplankton production, vertical foraging migrations to the seabed may become more frequent, also impacting krill production and harvesting. Potentially cumulative impacts of climate change further compound the management challenge faced by CCAMLR, the organization responsible for conservation of Antarctic marine living resources: to detect changes in the abundance, distribution, and reproductive performance of krill and krill-dependent predator stocks and to respond to such change by adjusting its conservation measures. Based on CCAMLR reports and documents, we review the institutional framework, outline how climate change has been addressed within this organization, and examine the prospects for further advances toward ecosystem risk assessment and an adaptive management system.

Because the effects of nitrifying bacteria are limited by the extremely low temperature of about 0degreesC, biological filtration does not keep up with the deterioration of water quality resulting from the excrement of animals and un-eaten food. It is therefore necessary to exchange seawater frequently in our present cold-water aquarium. We developed a new system at Port of Nagoya Public Aquarium (PNPA) that keeps Antarctic marine animals in good condition. The improved system increases the temperature of sea water to 10degreesC prior to biological filtration and thereby increases the effectiveness of the biological filter. The krill-rearing container was constructed inside the main tank so that the water flow inside the rearing container could be stopped. This avoids a rapid reduction of phytoplankton feed due to turnover of the seawater in the system while krill were fed. As a result of these improvements, long-term rearing, mass culture and reproduction of Antarctic krill are possible. We have exhibited Antarctic marine animals since the opening of PNPA in 1992, and we have exhibited Antarctic krill continuously since 1997. In this article, we detail the Antarctic krill breeding facilities at PNPA.																	1023-6244	1029-0362				DEC	2003	36	4					249	258		10.1080/10236240310001623637							WOS:000187994400006

However, it is not acceptable for direct consumption as traditional food, as its high content of fluoride is harmful to adults and children. Therefore, the safety of fluoride residue in Antarctic krill for food production should be investigated. In this research, the fluoride toxicity in Antarctic Krill was evaluated through mice feeding experiment. Their body weight was found not to be influenced by fluoride. However, dental fluorosis was observed in the krill group and the NaF group. Fluoride content in liver, kidney, urine, and bones are significantly different (P<0.05) among these three groups, which amount to plateau during the first ten days of feeding, except the fluoride in bone which keeps increasing all through the experimental time. Furthermore, less amount of fluoride was determined in the krill group compared with the amount in NaF group, even if they have the same concentration of fluoride. Besides, lesions in livers, kidneys and bones of the two experimental groups were observed through histopathological studies.

Distributions of krill and Antarctic silverfish and correlations with environmental variables in the western Ross Sea, Antarctica	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												Antarctic krill Euphausia superba, crystal krill E. crystallorophias, and Antarctic silverfish Pleuragramma antarctica are key mid-trophic level species in the Ross Sea, connecting primary production to the upper trophic levels. Distributions of these species were constructed from observations made in the western Ross Sea from 1988 to 2004. Distributions of environmental conditions were obtained from a 5-km resolution circulation model (temperature, mixed layer depth, surface speed) and satellite-derived observations (chlorophyll, sea ice cover). A hierarchy of statistical methods determined correlations and relationships between species and environmental conditions. Each species occupies a localized habitat defined by different environmental characteristics. Antarctic krill are concentrated along the northwestern shelf break in a habitat characterized by deep (>1000 m) bottom depth, warm temperature (1 to 1.25 degrees C), decreased sea ice, and proximity to the shelf break. Crystal krill and Antarctic silverfish are concentrated in Terra Nova Bay. Common characteristics of the habitat for these species are southwesterly location, coastal proximity, and cold temperature (-1.75 to -2 degrees C). The habitat characteristics obtained for the 3 species provide a basis for projecting potential distribution changes in response to environmental change and for delineating regions of the Ross Sea for focused management and selection of marine protected areas that support ecosystem-level conservation plans.

Linking Antarctic krill larval supply and recruitment along the Antarctic Peninsula	INTEGRATIVE AND COMPARATIVE BIOLOGY												Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) larval production and overwinter survival drive recruitment variability, which in turn determines abundance trends. The Antarctic Peninsula has been described as a recruitment hot spot and as a potentially important source region for larval and juvenile krill dispersal. However, there has been no analysis to spatially resolve regional-scale krill population dynamics across life stages. We assessed spatiotemporal patterns in krill demography using two decades of austral summer data collected along the North and West Antarctic Peninsula since 1993. We identified persistent spatial segregation in the summer distribution of euphausiid larvae (E. superba plus other species), which were concentrated in oceanic waters along the continental slope, and E. superba recruits, which were concentrated in shelf and coastal waters. Mature females of E. superba were more abundant over the continental shelf than the slope or coast. Euphausiid larval abundance was relatively localized and weakly correlated between the North and West Antarctic Peninsula, while E. superba recruitment was generally synchronized throughout the entire region. Euphausiid larval abundance along the West Antarctic Peninsula slope explained E. superba recruitment in shelf and coastal waters the next year. Given the localized nature of krill productivity, it is critical to evaluate the connectivity between upstream and downstream areas of the Antarctic Peninsula and beyond. Krill fishery catch distributions and population projections in the context of a changing climate should account for ontogenetic habitat partitioning, regional population connectivity, and highly variable recruitment.

J	Nicol, S; Constable, AJ; Pauly, T				Nicol, S; Constable, AJ; Pauly, T			Estimates of circumpolar abundance of Antarctic krill based on recent acoustic density measurements	CCAMLR SCIENCE												The total circumpolar abundance of Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) is estimated using recent measurements of krill density from acoustic surveys and historical information on the overall range of krill. The biomass estimates fall between 60 and 155 million tonnes at the low end of values that have been suggested in the past. The differences between our estimates and others can be explained by a number of factors such as: an underestimation of the range or the acoustic biomass estimates; the possibility of a large, undetected krill population; and the overestimation of the demand for krill by predators. Even if these low krill biomass estimates are correct, regional and total precautionary limits are still likely to rise as a result of new surveys because the method used to calculate precautionary limits uses a value of 11% of the estimated pre-exploitation biomass. Additionally, the current precautionary catch limits in the South Atlantic are set using a superseded acoustic target strength which has effectively underestimated the krill biomass by a factor of three, so the new survey of the South Atlantic in January 2000 may result in an effective biomass which is greater than the value used in the past. The seasonal and local consequences of large catch limits will have to be taken into account when managing an expanded krill fishery, and the appropriateness of using the existing statistical divisions as management areas will have to be considered.																	1023-4063						2000	7						87	99									WOS:000166295500005

Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) are a keystone species of the Antarctic sea ice ecosystem. Krill have repeatedly been found to accumulate a diverse array of POPs and thereby serve as vectors of these to the remainder of the Antarctic food web. p,p'-Dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (p,p'-DDE) is a dominant POP compound accumulating in Antarctic krill and higher trophic level predators. Recently, p,p'-DDE uptake dynamics, associated behavioural and developmental toxicity were evaluated in this species. The present study investigated the response of enzymes with known roles in detoxification (glutathione S-transferase, GST and cytochrome P450 2B, CYP2B), neurotoxicity (acetylcholinesterase, AChE) and oxidative stress (glutathione peroxidase GPx) in Antarctic krill exposed to p,p'-DDE. CYP2B was not detectable in Antarctic krill. No strong concentration responses resulted from the exposure to p,p'-DDE. These findings do not provide evidence for an activated detoxification response to this compound via the tested biochemical pathways in Antarctic krill. This is the first time that GST, AChE and GPx have been characterised in this species following pollutant exposure. Further research with additional pollutants and compound mixtures is necessary to assess the practical role of these enzymes as biomarkers of pollutant exposure in Antarctic krill. These first exploratory findings present a valuable contribution to a critical knowledge gap in polar ecotoxicology, namely the comparative sensitivity of polar organisms relative to temperate and tropical counterparts.

The dielectric constants and dielectric loss factor of amino acids were 2.0 +/- 0.4 and 0.2 +/- 0.3, respectively (moisture contents, 0.05-0.33%), except those of lysine (5.5 +/- 0.5 and 1.5 +/- 1.0, respectively) (moisture content, 4.5%). The dielectric properties of non-polar, neutral-polar, alkaline amino acids added to Antarctic krill were affected by the frequency and moisture contents, molecular weight, and isoelectric points (pI) of amino acids. As the molecular weight and pI values increased, the critical frequencies of aliphatic amino acid added to minced Antarctic krill decreased, whereas heterocyclic amino acid added to minced Antarctic krill increased. Quantitative relationships between parameters that define both the real and the imaginary parts of the Debye relations and the weight fraction of amino acid contents in Antarctic krill were determined. Moreover, glycine (at 5%) or lysine (at 5%) significantly influenced the dielectric constants and dielectric loss factor of minced Antarctic krill (p < 0.05) but did not have significant effects on temperature history and distribution (p < 0.05) during microwave heating at 2450 MHz.																	1935-5130	1935-5149				OCT	2017	10	10					1809	1823		10.1007/s11947-017-1952-x							WOS:000409365300006

In this paper, the hydrodynamic performance of an Antarctic krill trawl system (including trawler, cable, otter board and trawl) was studied by means of numerical simulation combined with full-scale measurement at sea. The numerical model was established based on finite element method and the principle of minimum potential energy was employed to determine the equilibrium configuration of the trawl system in uniform current. The Newton-Raphson method was applied to solve the equilibrium equation. A multi-wing vertical cambered otter board was designed and a series of wind tunnel model tests were carried on in order to explore the hydrodynamic performance (drag coefficient, lift coefficient and lift-drag ratio) of the otter board. By comparing the simulated results and the simulated results after correction with the experimental results at sea, the modified Tauti's law and the accuracy of the numerical method were verified. The results showed that the fishing vessel, the trawl and the otter board matched well on hydrodynamics. The effects of the warp length, the leg length, the towing speed and the angle of attack of the otter board on the net position, the spread of otter board and the spreading performance of net opening were analyzed. Scientific suggestions on the setting of each component of the trawl system were given based on the numerical simulation study. This paper could be regarded as a scientific reference for Antarctic krill trawl fishing operation.																	0029-8018	1873-5258				SEP 15	2021	236								109408	10.1016/j.oceaneng.2021.109408							WOS:000696705900005						
J	Loeb, V; Hofmann, EE; Klinck, JM; Holm-Hansen, O				Loeb, Valerie; Hofmann, Eileen E.; Klinck, John M.; Holm-Hansen, Osmund			Hydrographic control of the marine ecosystem in the South Shetland-Elephant Island and Bransfield Strait region	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY												The South Shetland-Elephant Island and Bransfield Strait region of the West Antarctic Peninsula is an important spawning and nursery ground of Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) and is an important source of krill to the Southern Ocean. Krill reproductive and recruitment success, hence supply of krill to predator populations locally and in downstream areas, are extremely variable on interannual and longer time scales. Interannual ecosystem variability in this region has long been recognized and thought related to El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events, but understanding of how has been limited by the hydrographic complexity of the region and lack of appropriate ocean-atmosphere interaction models. This study utilizes multidisciplinary data sets collected in the region from 1990 to 2004 by the U.S. Antarctic Living Marine Resources (AMLR) Program. We focus on hydrographic conditions associated with changes in the distribution, abundance and composition of salp- and copepod-dominated zooplankton assemblages during 1998 and 1999, years characterized respectively by a strong El Nino event and La Nina conditions. We provide detailed analyses of hydrographic, biological and ecological conditions during these dichotomous years in order to identify previously elusive oceanographic processes underlying ecosystem variability. We found that fluctuations between salp-dominated coastal zooplankton assemblages and copepod-dominated oceanic zooplankton assemblages result from the relative influence of Weddell Sea and oceanic waters and that these fluctuations are associated with latitudinal movement of the Southern Antarctic Circumpolar Current Front (sACCf). Latitudinal movements of the sACCf can be explained by meridional atmosphere teleconnections instigated in the western tropical Pacific Ocean by ENSO variability and are consistent with out-of-phase forcing in the South Pacific and South Atlantic Oceans by the Antarctic Dipole high-latitude climate mode. During El Nino decreased northwest winds, equatorward movement of the sACCf and an intensified Weddell Gyre allow Weddell Sea water to flow into eastern Bransfield Strait. During these periods mixing between oceanic and coastal waters is reduced, chlorophyll a concentrations are low, salps numerically dominate the zooplankton, and krill recruitment success is poor. During La Nina increased and more frequent northwest winds and poleward movement of the sACCf allows increased influence of oceanic waters and mixing of these with cold coastal waters. These periods are characterized by numerical dominance of copepods, elevated concentrations of oceanic zooplankton taxa and phytoplankton blooms that promote krill reproduction and recruitment success. Hydrographic and ecological changes after the 1998 El Nino are associated with a shift from frequent El Ninos to the prevalence of La Nina and neutral conditions and conform to a decadal-scale climate regime shift in the Antarctic Peninsula region.

QUANTIFYING MOVEMENT BEHAVIOUR OF VESSELS IN THE ANTARCTIC KRILL FISHERY	CCAMLR SCIENCE												Ten years of recent fine-scale haul-by-haul krill data were used to characterise the behaviour of the krill fishery. Analysis of distance between hauls in relation to their catch level revealed a distinct pattern. Mean between-haul distances were generally longer when catch levels fell below 10 tonnes/haul, and the travel distance decreased as the catch level increased; this pattern was most obvious for operations by Japanese fishing vessels. There were differences between statistical areas with longer distances moved between hauls in Subarea 48.1 compared to Subareas 48.2 and 48.3, reflecting the large number of fishing grounds within this area. The same patterns were observed for vessels from other nations, but were less clear. The study suggests the movement trends for Japanese vessels could form the basis for describing a generalised fishery model. Updates for some of the parameters for the krill fishery model suggested in the late 1980s are proposed based on the results from this study. These analyses demonstrate the need for high-quality year-round data on all vessels participating in the krill fishery to assist in interpreting the annual fishing patterns, which can best be collected by scientific observers.

A 616 base pair region of the cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) gene was screened for mutations by single-strand conformational polymorphism (SSCP) combined with restriction digestion. E. crystallorophias caught in three different regions of the Antarctic coastline were used - two samples from the Mertz Glacier Polynya and one sample each from the western side of the Antarctic Peninsula and from the Davis Sea. Significant genetic differences between krill samples were identified. However, the extent of these differences did not correlate with the degree of geographic separation between the sampling sites. This suggests that the genetic structuring may be the result of small-scale differentiation rather than differentiation between resident populations in separate parts of the Southern Ocean. The possibility that genetic differences between samples within a region are as important as differences between regions has implications for other studies of krill population genetics.

A quantitative relationship between the fluoride concentration in the aqueous solution and the dielectric loss at 0.3GHz was also established with a regression coefficient over 0.98. The concentrations of fluoride in fresh and dried krill samples with different krill positions, such as shell and meat, were determined. The detected value agrees well with that determined using other methods, such as fluoride ion-selective electrode (ISE) and potassium permanganate titration (PPT). The fluoride concentrations in fresh krill were 0.0127, 0.0133, and 0.0152 mg/mL using dielectric spectroscopy, PPT, and ISE, respectively. These results show that the proposed dielectric loss technique is suitable and effective for determining fluoride content in Antarctic krill.																	0253-2964	1229-5949				JUN	2015	36	6					1557	1562		10.1002/bkcs.10295							WOS:000355986100002

The used chemicals were NaOH, Na2CO3, Na2SO3, citric acid, acetic acid, phosphoric acid, HCl, ethanol, lysine, aminoguanidine, arginine, carnitine, betaine, and creatine. Fluoride contents per dry weight were 788 +/- 10mgkg1 in the whole body of krill (WBK) and 294 +/- 4mgkg1 in the peeled krill meat (PKM) respectively. When WBK was treated with chemicals with and without heating or thawed, fluoride was not decreased. On the other hand, when the PKM was treated with chemicals without heating was remarkably decreased to less than 100mgkg1, which is the criteria recommended by FDA. Particularly, the treatment of betaine without heating showed the best reduction effect of 30 +/- 6mgkg1, followed by carnitine (38 +/- 17mgkg1), acetic acid (52 +/- 1mgkg1), phosphoric acid (67 +/- 2mgkg1) and hydrochloric acid (68 +/- 1mgkg1).																	0950-5423					JUN	2013	48	6					1252	1259		10.1111/ijfs.12084							WOS:000318637500018

Immature and mature eugregarine gamont stages were found at all larval stages older than Calyptopis I stage. Eugregarine infection in 14.0% (N = 108) of the first feeding stage (Calyptopis I) suggested that krill larvae are at risk from being infected during physiological transition from non-feeding to feeding stages. Eugregarine prevalence and intensity of infection at the three calyptopis stages increased with stage/krill length. Statistical analysis showed that the intensity of C. pacifica infection also increased with host density. Thus, krill density is probably a key determinant of the intensity of infection. We found gamont stage eugregarines in the host hind-gut, blocking the passage of food. Eugregarine infections in larval krill may have a negative impact on digestion and absorption in the host digestive tract.

Stakeholder perspectives on ecosystem-based management of the Antarctic krill fishery	MARINE POLICY												Information about stakeholder aspirations is a fundamental requirement for ecosystem-based management, but the detail is often elusive, and debates may focus on simplistic opposing positions. This is exemplified by the Antarctic krill fishery, which, despite a current operational catch limit equivalent to just 1% of the estimated biomass and actual annual catches much lower than this, is the subject of a high profile debate framed around ambiguous concepts such as sustainability. Q methodology was applied to explore the detailed views of representatives of three stakeholder sectors (the fishing industry, conservation-focused non-governmental organisations (NGOs), and scientists from seven countries involved in research on the krill-based ecosystem). The analysis distinguished two clear groupings, one of which included the views of all NGO participants while the other included the views of fishing industry participants and a subset of the scientists. Key differences between the groups included the priority given to different management measures, and to continued commercial fishing. However, the results also revealed considerable overlap between viewpoints. Both groups prioritised the maintenance of ecosystem health and recognised the importance of defining management objectives. Also, neither group prioritised a decrease in catch limits. This suggests that most participants in the study agree that management should improve but do not perceive a major problem in the ecosystem's ability to support current catch levels. Cooperation to identify shared management objectives based on stakeholder aspirations for the ecosystem might enhance progress, whereas polarised discussions about preferred management measures or ambiguous concepts are likely to impede progress.

Interannual variability in Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) density at South Georgia, Southern Ocean: 1997-2013	ICES JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE												Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) are a key species in Southern Ocean ecosystems, maintaining very large numbers of predators, and fluctuations in their abundance can affect the overall structure and functioning of the ecosystems. The interannual variability in the abundance and biomass of krill was examined using a 17-year time-series of acoustic observations undertaken in the Western Core Box (WCB) survey area to the northwest of South Georgia, Southern Ocean. Krill targets were identified in acoustic data using a multifrequency identification window and converted to krill density using the Stochastic Distorted-Wave Born Approximation target strength model. Krill density ranged over several orders of magnitude (0-10 000 g m(-2)) and its distribution was highly skewed with many zero observations. Within each survey, the mean krill density was significantly correlated with the top 7% of the maximum krill densities observed. Hence, only the densest krill swarms detected in any one year drove the mean krill density estimates for the WCB in that year. WCB krill density (mu, mean density for the area) showed several years (1997/1998, 2001-2003, 2005-2007) of high values (mu, 30 g m(-2)) interspersed with years (1999/2000, 2004, 2009/2010) of low density (mu, 30 g m(-2)). This pattern showed three different periods, with fluctuations every 4-5 years. Cross correlation analyses of variability in krill density with current and lagged indices of ocean (sea surface temperature, SST and El Nino/Southern Oscillation) and atmospheric variability (Southern Annular Mode) found the highest correlation between krill density and winter SST (August SST) from the preceding year.

The prepared A-Chitosan powder showed low level of crystallinity and significantly high water binding capacity as 1293% (w/w). By mice tail amputation model and blood coagulation timing experiment, it is showed that this chitosan accelerated the tail hemostasis by 55% and shortened the blood clotting time by 38%. This efficacy was better than two other commercial chitosans investigated and was corresponding to their water binding capacities. Through examining the effect of chitosan on blood components, it could be found that platelets adhesion was mainly affected by the water binding capacity, and red blood cells aggregation was dependent on their deacetylation degree. The physicochemical properties resulted in better hydration property of chitosan would improve its hemostatic effect. These results suggested that Antarctic krill chitosan is a good candidate for hemostatic application. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The solubility of Antarctic krill proteins and their fluoride content were studied between pH 1.00-13.75. The previous krill protein extraction conditions using ISP were improved. Excess fluoride in Antarctic krill was removed using a water-washing method according to its solubility. To save water, a multistage countercurrent system was used to optimize the ISP method. The results showed that the solubility of Antarctic krill proteins reached a minimum at pH 4.5 and a maximum at pH 13.5, while the concentration of dissolved fluoride was relatively unchanged (16.78-20.50 mg/L), with pH 2.00-13.50. Water-washing 4 times could reduce fluoride 98.14 +/- 0.01% from krill with about a 5.14 +/- 0.21% protein loss. The reduction allows krill protein to meet the Chinese National Standard (GB 2762-2005) for fluoride. Meanwhile, the four-stage countercurrent system achieved almost the same high fluoride removal rate (98.58 +/- 0.01%) using only 25% of the water.																	1049-8850	1547-0636					2016	25	4					597	606		10.1080/10498850.2014.904461							WOS:000381280000013						
J	Candy, SG; Kawaguchi, S				Candy, SG; Kawaguchi, S			Modelling growth of Antarctic krill. II. Novel approach to describing the growth trajectory	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												Von Bertalanffy (VB) growth models for Antarctic krill have been calibrated from population-level data consisting of modal lengths obtained from a time sequence of length frequency samples. We developed an alternative approach to predicting the trajectory of length over time, using a step-growth function that combines models of instantaneous growth rate (IGR) at moult calibrated from direct measurements of individual pre- and post-moult krill sampled from the wild with a model of temperature-dependent inter-moult period (IMP), Using summer and early autumn data for juveniles and males sampled from the Indian Ocean sector of the Southern Ocean, we modelled IGR as a function of pre-moult length and season using linear mixed models (LMM) incorporating cubic smoothing splines. We generated a number of growth trajectories starting from an Age 1+ yr mean length, for different scenarios of winter and spring growth. We then provided convenient parametric approximations to these step trajectories for use in population dynamic modelling systems using either a punctuated-growth model based on an F-distribution or a seasonal-growth VB model. Alternatively, step-trajectories could be used directly. Our models indicated that, when allowing for shrinkage, at the start of the sixth winter after hatch (Age 5+ yr) the mean length of krill for the Indian Ocean sector was close to 53 mm, compared to 56 mm obtained from studies for the southwest Atlantic Ocean sector. In contrast, when shrinkage was not allowed for, a slightly higher mean length was obtained for krill from the Indian Ocean sector (57.5 mm) compared to krill from the southwest Atlantic Ocean sector.

From April 13 to 24, 2016, acoustic data were collected along 24 survey lines using the frequencies 38 and 120 kHz, and middle trawling was performed at 7 stations. Using the difference between the dB values of two volume backscattering strength (Sv) frequencies (38 and 120 kHz), a clear acoustic distinction could be made between Antarctic krill (4.9 to 12.0 dB) and fish (-4.0 to -0.2 dB). The distributions and mean Sv of krill swarms in the Elephant Island peripheries and south of South Shetland Island were higher than those in the west of South Shetland Island. The mean length/ height ratio of krill swarms in the west of the South Shetland Island (64.5) was higher than that in the south (35.9) and the Elephant Island peripheries (33.8), with the length of the aggregations exceeding their height. Most krill swarms were distributed between the surface layer (less than 10 m below sea level) and within 200 m of water depth. These results are expected to serve as baseline data for evaluating krill density and biomass by distinguishing them from fish, using acoustics.																	1738-5261	2005-7172				DEC	2018	53	4					667	677		10.1007/s12601-018-0043-x							WOS:000454745000006

Eighty seven percentage of the krill examined (n = 93) were infected with the parasites in the cephalin stage, which were regularly found in the hind-gut epithelium of their host. Cephalins were found attached to the epithelium, and then were liberated into the intestinal lumen. The gamont stage, which follows the cephalin stage, was found in the intestinal lumen, as well as the diverticulum of mid-gut gland. However, gamonts found in the mid-gut gland were considerably larger and elongated in comparison with those in the intestinal lumen. Gamonts in the diverticulum appear to damage microvilli, which are involved in the uptake of digested nutrients and secretion of various enzymes. Therefore, elevated infestation of this parasite in the mid-gut gland may have a significant impact on the nutritional state of the Antarctic krill host.

Krill protein isolate was phosphorylated by the dry-heating method with sodium pyrophosphate. Phosphorylated peptides from Antarctic krill (PP-AKP) were obtained from phosphorylated protein through tryptic hydrolysis. Two types of phosphate bonds were introduced by phosphorylation, i.e. P-O and P=O bonds. The anti-osteoporotic activities of PP-AKP at two doses (400 and 800 mg/kg body weight) were investigated with an osteoporotic rat model, which was established with bilateral ovariectomy surgery. Different doses of PP-AKP were given intraperitoneal injections to rats once a day with alendronate as a positive control. Phosphorylated peptides from Antarctic krill dose-dependently preserved bone mineral density in osteoporotic rats by increasing the degree of bone mineralization. Both trabecular and cortical bone strength in osteoporotic rats was significantly improved with PP-AKP treatment. The mechanism by which PP-AKP augmented bone mineral density and bone strength was relation to the reduction in osteoclast-mediated bone remodeling, as was supported by the decrease in bone resorption markers. Phosphorylated peptides from Antarctic krill could be developed as functional food or nutritional supplements. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Distribution and demography of Antarctic krill in the Southeast Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean during the austral summer 2008	POLAR BIOLOGY												This study documents horizontal distribution and demography of Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) from the Southern Ocean during January-March 2008. The cruise predominantly occurred in CCAMLR Subarea 48.6, where knowledge about the ecosystem is limited. E. superba were not found north of 52A degrees S. The biomass, estimated from trawl catches, was highest (63.09 g/m(2)) at a station 680 km southeast of Bouvetoya and at two stations 1,400 and 600 km southeast and southwest of Bouvetoya, 54.67 and 61.38 g/m(2), respectively. Body length ranged from 19 to 61 mm (N = 8,538), with a mean of 42.0 +/- A 6.4 mm (SD). The overall sex ratio was 1:1, 46.2% males (13.2% adults and 33.0% subadults), 46.1% females (33.6% adults and 12.5% subadults), while 7.5% were juveniles. Trawl stations dominated by adults were found west and north of Bouvetoya. Stations with high proportions of subadults and juveniles were mainly found southeast of the island. Four cluster groups were differentiated: analyzing data on krill sex proportions, maturity stages, hydrography, nutrients and chlorophyll concentrations. Two groups represented stations located in the northern part of the study area, where E. superba were absent; water temperatures were higher and the nutrient concentrations lower compared to the groups where E. superba were present. This study shows that bathymetric features like the North Weddell Ridge including Bouvetoya are important for concentrating krill probably due to water mass characteristics and advective processes which influence regional krill demography. The southern regions of CCAMLR sector 48.6 are essential for understanding regional krill recruitment and production.

Within the Southern Ocean, Antarctic krill (Euphausia Superba) support many marine predators and play a key role in the biogeochemical cycle. Ocean acidification and plastic pollution have been acknowledged to hinder Antarctic krill development and physiology in singularity, however potential multi-stressor effects of plastic particulates coupled with ocean acidification are unexplored. Furthermore, Antarctic krill may be especially vulnerable to plastic pollution due to their close association with sea-ice, a known plastic sink. Here, we investigate the behaviour of nanoplastic [spherical, aminated (NH2), and yellow-green fluorescent polystyrene nanoparticles] in Antarctic seawater and explore the single and combined effects of nanoplastic (160 nm radius, at a concentration of 2.5 mu g ml(-1)) and ocean acidification (pCO(2) similar to 900, pH(T) 7.7) on the embryonic development of Antarctic krill. Gravid female krill were collected in the Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean (North Scotia Sea). Produced eggs were incubated at 0.5 degrees C in four treatments (control, nanoplastic, ocean acidification and the multi-stressor scenario of nanoplastic presence, and ocean acidification) and their embryonic development after 6 days, at the incubation endpoint, was determined. We observed that negatively charged nanoplastic particles suspended in seawater from the Scotia Sea aggregated to sizes exceeding the nanoscale after 24 h (1054.13 +/- 53.49 nm). Further, we found that the proportion of embryos developing through the early stages to reach at least the limb bud stage was highest in the control treatment (21.84%) and lowest in the multi-stressor treatment (13.17%). Since the biological thresholds to any stressors can be altered by the presence of additional stressors, we propose that future nanoplastic ecotoxicology studies should consider the changing global ocean under future climate scenarios for assessments of their impact and highlight that determining the behaviour of nanoplastic particles used in incubation studies is critical to determining their toxicity.																		2296-7745				AUG 3	2021	8								709763	10.3389/fmars.2021.709763							WOS:000686142500001						
J	Pakhomov, EA; Perissinotto, R				Pakhomov, EA; Perissinotto, R			Antarctic neritic krill Euphausia crystallorophias: Spatio-temporal distribution, growth and grazing rates	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART I-OCEANOGRAPHIC RESEARCH PAPERS												Dynamics of distribution, growth, life span and feeding were studied in the endemic Antarctic euphausiid Euphausia crystallorophias in the central part of the Indian sector of the Southern Ocean during the austral summer, from 1977 to 1990, and in the Lazarev Sea during the summer 1990/91. Both larvae and adult E. crystallorophias were found in abundance in shelf waters of 100-500 m depth. Maximum abundances of larvae (up to 23,969 ind. 1000 m(-3)) and adults (up to 12,670 ind. 1000 m(-3)) were found in the Prydz Bay region. Size frequency analysis indicated that the generation time was approximate to 3 years in the Indian sector of the Southern Ocean. Total life span of E. crystallorophias may reach 5 years in the Prydz Bay region and 4 years in the Cosmonaut Sea. Analysis of size distribution by sex suggests that male E. crystallorophias may have a shorter life span than females. Growth for only 180 days per year is assumed, mean growth rates ranged from 0.070-0.075 to 0.019-0.022 mm per day during the first and the fourth year, respectively. Von Bertalanffy growth curves calculated for different areas were similar to those obtained in the Antarctic Peninsula region. In the Prydz Bay and the Cosmonaut Sea, spawning of E. crystallorophias appears to peak from the end of November to early December and may extend to the beginning of January. Most larvae were in the stage of metanauplius/calyptopis I at the beginning of January and calyptopis III/furcilia I during February. The year-1 cohort was identified in January-February and exhibited a mean length in the range 10.8-15.8 mm. In situ feeding rates were estimated in the Lazarev Sea using the gut fluorescence method. Ingestion rates during austral summer 1990/91 ranged from 52 to 471 ng (pigm) ind(-1) h(-1) in adults and from 2.5 to 25.2 ng (pigm) ind(-1) h(-1) in calyptopis III larvae. Total population impact on the phytoplankton stock varied between 160-2860 and 215-652 mu g (C) m(-1) day(-1) for adults and larvae, respectively. This is equivalent to 0.06-1.12% and 0.02-0.07% of total daily production. In areas with dense E. crystallorophias swarms, however, daily consumption rates may attain levels as high as 13.6-96.5% of daily primary production. The long-term monitoring of different populations of E. crystallorophias allowed the identification of similar patterns between its abundance and spawning success and the formation of coastal polynyas, especially in the Prydz Bay region.																	0967-0637					JAN	1996	43	1					59	87		10.1016/0967-0637(95)00094-1							WOS:A1996UB14200004						
J	Murphy, EJ; Thorpe, SE; Watkins, JL; Hewitt, R				Murphy, EJ; Thorpe, SE; Watkins, JL; Hewitt, R			Modeling the krill transport pathways in the Scotia Sea: spatial and environmental connections generating the seasonal distribution of krill	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY												A coupled physical-biological model analysis was undertaken to examine the seasonal development of the distribution of antarctic krill (Euphausia superba Dana) in the Scotia Sea. The origin and fate of krill observed during the CCAMLR 2000 survey were studied using output from the OCCAM model. Lagrangian particle tracking for the period prior to the survey showed the expected dominance of the west to east flow of material associated with the main direction of the current flow, but there was no simple association of particle transport with any of the fronts of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current. Most of the krill were associated with areas to the south of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current in the Weddell-Scotia Confluence (WSC) and farther east in Weddell Sea-influenced waters. Examining the pathways of krill transport in relation to satellite-derived sea-ice distributions suggests that particles present in the high krill biomass regions in January would have come from areas that were covered by sea-ice during late winter/early spring (September-October). The results of Eulerian grid-based simulations of the development of the biomass distribution after the survey period showed transport of particles around South Georgia, probably in association with the Southern Antarctic Circumpolar Current Front. However, many of the krill encountered in the eastern Scotia Sea would have exited toward the east, passing north of the South Sandwich Islands, probably in association with the Southern Boundary of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current and Weddell Sea waters that penetrate to the north in this area. These krill may return to more southern regions where further spawning is possible in later years. Simulations of particle tracks that included diurnal vertical migration showed that krill behavior could modify the pathways of transport, although the current flows probably dominate the movement of krill in open ocean regions. This study suggests that the summer distribution of krill in the Scotia Sea is connected to the winter sea-ice distribution and probably to the pattern and rate of the spring sea-ice retreat. Many of the krill in the survey region in the summer of 1999/2000 came from under the sea-ice in the eastern Scotia Sea, the southern Scotia Arc, and the northern Weddell Sea. This highlights that the spatial association of the sea-ice with the Weddell-Scotia Confluence and frontal regions of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current during winter and spring will be crucial in determining the summer krill distribution. Variation in the extent and timing of sea-ice retreat, and fluctuations in Weddell-Scotia Confluence and Scotia Sea flows, will change the pathways of transport resulting in large changes in the distribution of the krill during summer.

Besides vertebrates, melatonin has been detected throughout phylogeny in numerous non-vertebrate taxa. In the present study, the occurrence of melatonin in Antarctic krill Euphausia superba and its possible role in mediating seasonal metabolic changes was evaluated. Melatonin was quantified by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) purified extracts of eyestalks and hemolymph of krill sampled in the Lazarev Sea during the Antarctic winter and summer. In addition, oxygen uptake rates and the activities of the metabolic enzyme malate dehydrogenase (MDH) were recorded to assess the metabolic status of krill. Validation of melatonin measurements was carried out on the basis of three different extraction methods with parallel determination of melatonin by ELISA in crude extracts and in HPLC purified extracts, and after derivatization of melatonin under alkaline conditions in the presence of hydrogen peroxide. A significantly higher respiration rate and MDH activity was found in summer krill than in winter krill indicating that krill was in a state of reduced metabolic activity during winter. However, neither during winter nor during summer there were detectable melatonin concentrations in the visual system or hemolymph of krill. Based on these results, we question a mediating role of melatonin in the control of seasonal metabolic changes in Antarctic krill. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The nutrient compositions and properties of the by-products were revealed by being compared to those of Antarctic krill muscle and the economically important species of freshwater prawns (Macrobrachium nipponense) and penaeid shrimps (Metapenaeus ensis). The by-products are worthy of utilization because of the high ratio to the total weight (65.7%). The crude protein contents in the muscle and by-products of krill are 17.4 and 11.7%, respectively. The krill proteins have higher contents of essential amino acids (EAAs). The EAAs constitute 42 and 37% of the TAAs in muscle and by-products, respectively. The krill processing by-products contain high levels of total lipid (3.3%), and polyunsaturated fatty acids constitute 34% of fatty acids with high levels of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA; 19.08%) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA; 10.02%). Krill meat provides considerable iron, zinc, calcium, selenium, and copper. It is imperative to lower the fluoride level (70.1 mg/kg, wet basis) in krill muscle. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) reveals that myosin heavy chain (MHC) and actin are the major proteins in muscle, and their contents vary between species.																	1049-8850	1547-0636					2016	25	3					434	443		10.1080/10498850.2013.809621							WOS:000378703000015

However, questions have been raised about using fatty acids as dietary indicators from whole lipid samples, rather than from separate lipid classes. A drawback of scientific field-based studies is that samples are rarely collected over extended periods, precluding seasonal dietary comparisons. We used fisheries samples obtained over one year to investigate seasonal variations in the fatty acid composition of separated phospholipids and triacylglycerols of Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba). Seasonal variation was observed in fatty acid biomarkers within triacylglycerol and phospholipid fractions of krill. Fatty acids in krill triacylglycerols (thought to best represent recent diet), reflected omnivorous feeding with highest percentages of flagellate biomarkers (18:4n-3) in summer, and diatom biomarkers (16:1n-7c) in autumn, winter and spring. Carnivory biomarkers ( n-ary sumation 20:1 + 22:1 and 18:1n-9c/18:1n-7c) in krill were higher in autumn. Phospholipid fatty acids were less variable and higher in 20:5n-3 and 22:6n-3, which are essential components of cell membranes. Sterol composition did not yield detailed dietary information, but percentages and quantities of cholesterol, the major krill sterol, were significantly higher in winter and spring compared with summer and autumn. Copepod markers n-ary sumation 20:1 + 22:1 were not strongly associated with the triacylglycerol fraction during some seasons, and neither was 18:4n-3. Krill might mobilise 18:4n-3 from triacylglycerols to phospholipids for conversion to long-chain (>= C-20) polyunsaturated fatty acids, which would have implications for its role as a dietary biomarker. For the first time, we demonstrate the dynamic seasonal relationship between specific biomarkers and krill lipid classes.

At present, however, little information is available about allergens in edible crustaceans other than decapods. In this study, the major allergen in two species of edible crustaceans, Antarctic krill Euphausia superba and mantis shrimp Oratosquilla oratoria that are taxonomically distinct from decapods, was demonstrated to be tropomyosin by IgE-immunoblotting using patient sera. The cross-reactivity of the tropomyosins from both species with decapod tropomyosins was also confirmed by inhibition IgE immunoblotting. Sequences of the tropomyosins from both species were determined by complementary deoxyribonucleic acid cloning. The mantis shrimp tropomyosin has high sequence identity (> 90% identity) with decapod tropomyosins, especially with fast-type tropomyosins. On the other hand, the Antarctic krill tropomyosin is characterized by diverse alterations in region 13-42, the amino acid sequence of which is highly conserved for decapod tropomyosins, and hence, it shares somewhat lower sequence identity (82.4-89.8% identity) with decapod tropomyosins than the mantis shrimp tropomyosin. Quantification by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay revealed that Antarctic krill contains tropomyosin at almost the same level as decapods, suggesting that its allergenicity is equivalent to decapods. However, mantis shrimp was assumed to be substantially not allergenic because of the extremely low content of tropomyosin.

The enzymes were highly concentrated in the exudate (drip) obtained after thawing 25 kg of frozen krill blocks. They presented an unusually high stability in this material, retaining over 40% of the initial activity after 60 days of storage at 45 degrees C. From this wastewater, trypsin-like enzymes were purified 140-fold in one step by affinity chromatography on p-aminobenzamidine Sepharose 4B. The purified enzymes migrated as a broad band in polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and presented a molecular weight between 32 000 and 33 000. The use of krill processing wastewater as a source for commercial production of trypsin-like enzymes is discussed. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

During the experiments which use the traditional acid and alkali method to extract the chitin from Antarctic krill, the chitin's extraction efficiency was found out to have a great influence on the degree of grinding the shell. After testing and then come to a conclusion that based on the chitin content: extraction efficiency, concentration and dosage of the acid and alkali as well as many other factors, the material's fineness should be within forty mesh. And the optimum process conditions are: alkali treatment: concentration 25%, solid-liquid ratio 1:10, temperature 95 degrees C, 2 hours; acid treatment: concentration 10%, solid-liquid ratio 1:10, temperature 60 degrees C, 2 hours. By this way, 94.254% high-purity chitin was produced.																	1022-6680		978-3-03785-692-5				2013	690-693						1624	1627		10.4028/www.scientific.net/AMR.690-693.1624							WOS:000322498600333						
J	Croxall, JP; Reid, K; Prince, PA				Croxall, JP; Reid, K; Prince, PA			Diet, provisioning and productivity responses of marine predators to differences in availability of Antarctic krill	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												Knowledge of relationships between prey availability and predator performance is the key to using predators as indicators of the state of marine systems and to assessing potential consequences of competition between natural predators and man for common resources. Fluctuations in the abundance of Antarctic krill are believed to have a substantial influence on the reproductive performance of krill-dependent top predator species in the Southern Ocean; few quantifications of such interactions exist. At South Georgia, for 2 years in which acoustic surveys revealed a major difference in krill abundance, we compared diet, provisioning of offspring and breeding success in 4 main predator species (2 penguins, 2 albatrosses, with supporting data from Antarctic fur seal) whose dependence on krill typically ranges from 20 to 90%. The 4-fold difference in krill biomass between 1986 (ca 30 g m(-2)) and 1994 (ca 7 g m(-2)) was accompanied by (1) an 88 to 90% reduction in the mass of krill in predator diets (and some increase in the fish component), (2) greater prey diversity for most species, (3) reduced diet overlap between species and (4) a switch from krill to amphipods in macaroni penguin but no major dietary change in other species. Rates of provisioning of offspring decreased by 90% in gentoo penguin and 40 to 50% in the other 3 species; this was due to reduced meal size in penguins (by 90% in gentoo and 50% in macaroni) and to doubling of foraging trip duration in albatrosses. Breeding success was reduced by 50% in grey-headed albatross (the species least dependent on krill), by 90% in black-browed albatross and gentoo penguin (only 3 to 4% of eggs producing fledged chicks) but by only 10% in macaroni penguin, presumably reflecting its ability to switch to small prey unprofitable for the other species. However, all species (except for black-browed albatross), particularly macaroni penguin, produced fledglings significantly lighter than usual, probably affecting their subsequent survival. Some effects on adult survival could also be inferred. Our results show a coherent, though complex, pattern of within and between species similarities and differences. These mainly reflect the degree of dependence on krill, the feasibility of taking alternative prey and constraints on trip duration and/or meal size imposed by foraging adaptations (especially relating to travel speeds and diving abilities, whereby flightless divers and pelagic foragers differ markedly). The generality of these principles are explored through comparison with other studies, particularly of Shetland seabirds.																	0171-8630						1999	177						115	131		10.3354/meps177115							WOS:000079215300011

Starting in the Discovery era with Mackintosh at the King Edward Point labs on South Georgia, 1930, scientists have collected krill from sailing vessels, small boats, inflatable zodiacs and large ice-breaking vessels. Krill have been maintained in small and large jars, deep rectangular tanks, large round tanks and in flow-through and recycling systems. They have been maintained both on board research vessels and in laboratories, in flowing seawater systems at ambient conditions and in temperature-controlled environmental rooms. A few researchers have transported living krill back to their home laboratories, for example tropical laboratories in Japan (Murano) and Australia (Ikeda), temperate laboratories (Nicol) in Australia, a northern European laboratory in Germany (Marschall) and a sunny maritime laboratory in California (Ross and Quetin). The goals have been varied: short-term experiments to understand in situ physiological rates, long-term experiments to test the effects of manipulations or controlled changes in environmental conditions, and behavioral responses. We take you on a brief historical tour as we trace the lineage of modern day research on living Antarctic krill.																	1023-6244	1029-0362				DEC	2003	36	4					207	228		10.1080/10236240310001623385							WOS:000187994400004						
J	Mori, M; Butterworth, DS				Mori, M.; Butterworth, D. S.			A first step towards modelling the krill-predator dynamics of the Antarctic ecosystem	CCAMLR SCIENCE												The history of human harvests of seals, whales, fish and krill in the Antarctic is summarised briefly, and the central role played by krill emphasised. The background to the hypothesis of a krill surplus in the mid-20th century is described, and the information on population and trend levels that has become available since the postulate was first advanced is discussed. The objective of the study is to determine whether predator-prey interactions alone can broadly explain observed population trends without the need for recourse to environmental change hypotheses. A model is developed including krill, four baleen whale (blue, fin, humpback and minke) and two seal (Antarctic fur and crabeater) species. The model commences in 1780 (the onset of fur seal harvests) and distinguishes the Atlantic/Indian and Pacific Ocean sectors of the Southern Ocean in view of the much larger past harvests in the former. A reference case and six sensitivities are fitted to available data on predator abundances and trends, and the plausibility of the results and the assumptions on which they are based is discussed, together with suggested further areas for investigation. Amongst the key inferences of the study are that: (i) species interaction effects alone can explain observed predator abundance trends, though not without some difficulty; (ii) it is necessary to consider other species, in addition to baleen whales and krill, to explain observed trends - crabeater seals seemingly play an important role and constitute a particular priority for improved abundance and trend information; (iii) the Atlantic/Indian Ocean sector shows major changes in species abundances, in contrast to the Pacific Ocean sector, which is much more stable; (iv) baleen whales have to be able to achieve relatively high growth rates to explain observed trends; and (v) Laws' (1977) estimate of some 150 million tonnes for the krill surplus may be appreciably too high as a result of his calculations omitting consideration of density-dependent effects in feeding rates.																	1023-4063						2006	13						217	277									WOS:000242336000012						
J	Fach, BA; Meyer, B; Wolf-Gladrow, D; Bathmann, U				Fach, Bettina A.; Meyer, Bettina; Wolf-Gladrow, Dieter; Bathmann, Ulrich			Biochemically based modeling study of Antarctic krill Euphausia superba growth and development	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												A biochemical model of Antarctic krill Euphausia superba was developed to investigate the physiological mechanisms which enable krill to survive winter, when food is scarce. In this modeling approach data sets on the biochemical composition of krill and its food sources are combined into a model that takes food quality into account rather than just food availability during different seasons. Krill is defined in terms of protein, neutral lipid, polar lipid, carbohydrate, chitin, and ash content, and the model tracks krill neutral lipid content separately from weight. The model includes parameterizations of filtration, ingestion, and metabolic processes which determine krill growth rate. Initial ratios of protein, neutral lipid, polar lipid, carbohydrate and ash change in chitin response to the biochemical composition of food as krill grows. Model results show that a diet of phytoplankton food alone may be sufficient for krill to grow to observed sizes but may not be sufficient to provide the summer lipid resources that are observed in the field and that are necessary for krill to reproduce and survive winter. The inclusion of sea ice algae as an additional food is beneficial for krill at the end of winter but does not significantly change summer krill lipid content. However, the amount of lipids accumulated within krill increases significantly when krill feeds on lipid-rich heterotrophic food, which points to the importance of carnivory, even in times when phytoplankton food is available. The strategy of combusting body components to produce energy (shrinking) is found to provide the greatest source of energy for krill of all sizes during times of prolonged starvation.

Patterns of total mercury and methylmercury bioaccumulation in Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) along the West Antarctic Peninsula	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												We examined mercury (Hg) accumulation in juvenile and adult subpopulations of Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) collected west of the Antarctic Peninsula. Samples were collected along a northern cross-shelf transect beginning near Anvers Island and farther south near the sea ice edge in the austral summers of 2011, 2013, 2014, and 2015. Regardless of geographical position, mean concentrations of total Hg and methylmercury (MeHg), the form of Hg that biomagnifies in marine food webs, were significantly higher in juvenile than adult krill in all years. In 2013, juvenile Antarctic krill collected along the coast near Anvers Island had significantly higher MeHg concentrations than krill collected farther offshore, and in 2013 and 2014, coastal juvenile krill exhibited some of the highest MeHg concentrations of all subpopulations sampled. Across all sampling years, collection in northern (sea ice-free) or southern (sea ice edge) transects did not affect MeHg concentrations of juvenile or adult krill, suggesting similar levels and routes of MeHg exposure across the latitudes sampled. Developmental stage, feeding near the coast, and annual variations in sea ice-driven primary and export production were identified as potentially important factors leading to greater MeHg accumulation in juvenile than adult krill. Krill-dependent predators feeding primarily on juveniles may thus accumulate more MeHg than consumers foraging on older krill. These results report MeHg concentrations in Antarctic krill and will be useful for predicting Hg biomagnification in higher-level consumers in this productive Antarctic ecosystem.

J	Yoshitomi, B; Nagano, I				Yoshitomi, Bunji; Nagano, Ichiro			Effect of dietary fluoride derived from Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) meal on growth of yellowtail (Seriola quinqueradiata)	CHEMOSPHERE												Yellowtail (Serbia quinqueradiata) is the most important cultured marine fish in Japan. Dietary fish meal for yellowtail in aquaculture was replaced with 0.0%, 15.4% and 100.0% Antarctic krill meal (KM0, KM15, and KM100) and with 0.0%, 15.4%, and 100.0% low-fluoride krill meal (LFK0, LFK15 and LFK100). The fish was fed to duplicate fish groups for 92 d (KM trial) or 75 d (LFK trial), and fish growth was monitored. Dietary fluoride (F-) concentrations (mg kg(-1)) were 110, 160, and 580 (KM0, KM15, and KM100, respectively) and 98, 120, and 190 (LFK0, LFK15, and LFK100, respectively). The growth during the experimental period, weight gain, feed intake, specific growth rate, and feed efficiency in fish fed the KM100 diet were markedly lower than the other experimental groups, which showed no marked differences in growth performance. After the experiment, dorsal muscle fluoride concentrations in each group were below the detectable limit (1 mg kg-1), but vertebral bone fluoride concentrations increased with increasing proportion of KM to 655 (KM0), 870 (KM15), and 2150 (KM100) mg kg-1. With increasing LFK in the feed, vertebral bone fluoride concentrations (mg kg-1) increased slightly from 500 (LFK0) to 655 (LFK15), and 695 (LFK100). No histopathological changes were detected in the liver tissue in any experimental group. It has been reported that the fluoride bioavailability was reduced with increasing water hardness, however, the dietary fluoride derived from KM exoskeleton accumulates in vertebral bones of marine fish with growth inhibition, as has already been shown for freshwater fish. Vertebral bone fluoride concentrations in two krill-eating Antarctic marine fish in the wild were 33000 mg kg(-1) (Champsocephalus gunnari) and 15000 mg kg(-1) (Notothenia rossii), but they did not show any adverse effect of growth. Therefore, fish bone fluoride accumulation apparently depends on fish species rather than the salinity of the habitat. Consequently, krill exoskeleton must be removed during the processing of Antarctic krill if indeed these krill are to be used as fish feed. However, LFK can completely replace dietary fish meal without apparent adverse effects. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

To examine their foraging strategy, we studied foraging trip patterns and diving behaviour of chinstrap penguins breeding at Signy Island, Antarctica, using time-depth recorders. Foraging trips of penguins could be divided into 2 groups, short diurnal (7.8 h) and longer overnight (19.9 h) trips, with diurnal trips (74%) being dominant in number (263 out of 355 trips). The diving depths of our study birds were much deeper (to 179 m) than previous studies on this species, with modal maximum dive depth at around 90 to 100 m. Diving patterns and profiles included typical pelagic dives, but also included series of consecutive square-wave shaped dives reaching similar maximum depth, the typical characteristics of benthic dives. These benthic-type dives were more abundant in diurnal foraging trips than overnight trips. Analysis of stomach contents showed that penguins on both types of trip fed almost exclusively on Antarctic krill. There was a positive relationship between indices of the proportion of benthic feeding and of foraging efficiency (stomach content mass divided by foraging trip duration). These results highlight the potential importance of benthic feeding on Antarctic krill, the first such recorded instance for chinstrap penguins. This previously undescribed foraging strategy by one of the major avian consumers of Antarctic krill provides a new insight into the predator-prey interactions of the Antarctic coastal marine ecosystem.

Forty-nine PL molecular species were characterized by ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UHPLC-Q-TOF-MS). Most of molecular species contained eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA, 20:5), docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, 22:6), docosapentaenoic acid (DPA, 22:5), and arachidonic acid (AA, 20:4). Notably, a special species PC (20:5/22:6) (1298.17 nmol/g) and many ether PLs were detected. The Antarctic krill PL liposome (IC50 = 0.108 mg/mL) showed better anti-inflammatory activity than crude Antarctic krill oil (IC50 = 0.446 mg/mL). It could block NF-kappa B signaling pathway via suppression of I kappa B-alpha degradation and p65 activation and dose-dependently reduce the cellular content of inflammatory mediators including nitric oxide (NO), reactive oxygen species (ROS), and inflammatory cytokines in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated RAW 264.7 cells. In addition, it can suppress carrageenan-induced mouse paw swelling. Results from the present study could provide a reference for better evaluation of nutritional and medicinal values of Antarctic krill oil.

The raw materials were recyclable cellulose (C) and Antarctic krill protein (AKP), while the solvent was an aqueous solution containing 7 wt% NaOH and 12 wt% urea, which is eco-friendly. The fiber was stretched in a coagulation bath containing H2SO4 and Na2SO4. The effects of coagulation at different bath concentrations on the mechanical performance, crystallinity, and morphology of the C/AKP composite fibers were studied systematically. The break strength firstly increased and then decreased with an increase in the concentration of the bath. At a coagulation bath concentration of H2SO2/Na2SO4 (12 wt%/12 wt%), the crystallinity was 15.16%. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) observations revealed the presence of grooves on the fiber surface. The type and percentage of hydrogen bonds in the C/AMP composite fibers were analyzed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR). On the basis of the obtained results, we finally optimized the coagulation bath composition and concentration. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Molecular approach (PCR-DGGE) to diet analysis in young Antarctic krill Euphausia superba	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												Antarctic krill Euphausia superba Dana comprise a key component of the Southern Ocean food web, yet despite decades of research, questions concerning the regional, seasonal and ontogenetic differences in their diet remain. All current methods used to characterize krill diet have limitations for identifying the full complement of the diet. Using DNA as a marker molecule, our goal in this study has been to evaluate the efficacy of a PCR-DGGE (denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis) approach targeting the 18S rDNA gene to discriminate among diet constituents in gut and fecal pellet samples from young Antarctic krill relative to their feeding environment-the seawater and sea ice microbial community. We conducted 2 laboratory-based feeding experiments with known food items and 3 field samplings of both the krill and their feeding environment. Sequenced PCR-DGGE phylotypes from laboratory trials clearly distinguished diatom and copepod prey, while in situ feeding analyses revealed that a broad diversity of taxa were ingested, including diatoms (Bacillariophyta, the most prevalent group detected), dinoflagellates, cryptomonads, prasinophytes, ciliates, cercozoans, choanoflagellates, turbellarians and (possibly) sponge larvae. Band image analyses allowed environmental and diet phylotypes to be matched. On average, 32% of those from the environment were present in the diet; conversely, of the phylotypes detected in the diet, an average of 59% were in common with the environment. Changes in environmental phylotypes among sampling dates were reflected by similar changes in the krill diet as potential prey diversity (richness) decreased during a phytoplankton bloom.																	0171-8630						2006	319						155	165		10.3354/meps319155							WOS:000241102600014

One such factor that remains poorly known is the role of parasites. A recent study of krill diet using DNA analysis of gut contents provided a snapshot of the parasites present within 170 E. superba guts in a small area along the West Antarctic Peninsula. These parasites included Metschnikowia spp. fungi, Haptoglossa sp. peronosporomycetes, Lankesteria and Paralecudina spp. apicomplexa, Stegophorus sp. nematodes, and Pseudocollinia spp. ciliates. Of these parasites, Metschnikowia spp. fungi and Pseudocollinia spp. ciliates had previously been observed in E. superba, as had other genera of apicomplexans, though not Lankesteria and Paralecudina. In contrast, nematodes had previously only been observed in eggs of E. superba, and there are no literature reports of peronosporomycetes in euphausiids. Pseudocollinia spp., parasitoids which obligately kill their host, were the most frequently observed infection, with a prevalence of 12%. The wide range of observed parasites and the relatively high frequency of infections suggest parasites may play a more important role than previously acknowledged in E. superba ecology and population dynamics.																	0954-1020	1365-2079				FEB	2019	31	1					16	22		10.1017/S0954102018000469							WOS:000459031700004						
J	Meyer, B; Atkinson, A; Blume, B; Bathmann, UV				Meyer, B; Atkinson, A; Blume, B; Bathmann, UV			Feeding and energy budgets of larval Antarctic krill Euphausia superba in summer	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												The physiological condition and feeding activity of the dominant larval stages of Euphausia superba (calyptopis stage III, furcilia stages I and II) were investigated from February to March 2000 at the Rothera Time Series monitoring station (67degrees34'S, 68degrees07'W, Adelaide Island, Western Antarctic Peninsula). A dense phytoplankton bloom (5 to 25 mug chl a l(-1)) occupied the mixed layer throughout the study period. The feeding of larvae was measured by incubating the animals in natural seawater. Food concentrations ranged from 102 to 518 mug C l(-1) across experiments, and the mean daily C rations were 28% body C for calyptosis stage Ill (CIII), 25% for furcilia stage I (FI) and 15% for FII. The phytoplankton, dominated by diatoms and motile prey taxa, ranged from 8 to 79 pm in size. Across this size spectrum of diatoms, CIII cleared small cells most efficiently, as did FI to a lesser degree. FII, however, showed no clear tendency for a specific cell size. Across the measured size spectrum of the motile taxa, all larvae stages showed a clear preference towards the larger cells. Estimated C assimilation efficiencies were high, from 70 to 92% (mean 84%). Respiration rates of freshly caught larvae were 0.7 to 1.1 mul O-2 mg DM-1 h(-1). The calculated respiratory C loss showed a significant increase with increasing food concentration in all larval stages, ranging from 0.9 to 2.4% body C d(-1). These respiratory losses, combined with the high assimilation efficiencies, thus give the larvae ample capacity for growth at these food concentrations. Critical concentrations of food to achieve maximum daily rations were in the range of 100 to 200 mug C l(-1) (similar to2 to 4 mug chl a l(-1)). Thus productive shelf sites along the Antarctic Peninsula, such as Rothera, may act as good 'nursery' areas for krill larvae.

Environmental correlates of Antarctic krill distribution in the Scotia Sea and southern Drake Passage	ICES JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE												Antarctic krill is a key prey species for many vertebrate and invertebrate predators in the Southern Ocean; it is also an abundant fishery resource in the Scotia Sea and southern Drake Passage. Here, we identify environmental correlates of krill distribution utilizing acoustic data collected during an extensive international survey in January 2000. Separate models (at scales of 10-80 nautical miles) were derived for the full study area and for each of four subregions: northern and southern shelf waters, the seasonally ice-covered open ocean, and the generally ice-free open ocean. Krill distribution was strongly correlated with bathymetry; densities were higher over island shelves and shelf breaks and decreased with increasing distance offshore. Low krill densities occurred in areas of low chlorophyll concentration and high geostrophic velocity. Krill distribution was also related to sea level anomaly but relationships were not consistent between subregions. The models explained a maximum of 44% of the observed deviance in krill density, but did not reliably identify areas of high krill density in the open ocean, and explained a small proportion of the deviance (16%) in offshore areas covered seasonally by sea ice, probably because of the strong, residual influence of retreated ice. The commercial krill fishery is currently concentrated in shelf areas, where high densities of krill are most predictable. As krill are not predictable in the open ocean, the fishery is likely to remain principally a near-shore operation, and should be managed accordingly.

The diet of Antarctic krill in the Prydz Bay during austral summer of 2012/2013 was investigated and the ontogenetic shift in krill diet was evaluated using the stable isotope method. The nitrogen stable isotope values (delta N-15) of adults ((2.78 +/- 0.58)aEuro degrees) were much higher than those of juveniles ((1.69 +/- 0.70)aEuro degrees), whereas the carbon stable isotope values (delta C-13) of adults (-(28.26 +/- 1.08)aEuro degrees) were slightly lower than those of juveniles (-(27.48 +/- 1.35)aEuro degrees). Particulate organic matter (POM) from 0, 25, and 50 m depth combined (0/25/50 m) represented phytoplankton food items. The results showed that phytoplankton food items in surface water and mesozooplankton were two essential food items for Antarctic krill in the Prydz Bay during summer. POM (0/25/50 m) contributes 56%-69% and 26%-34% to the diet of juvenile and adult krill, respectively, whereas mesozooplankton composes 13%-34% and 58%-71% of the diet of juvenile and adult krill, respectively. Thus, an ontogenetic diet shift from POM (0/25/50 m), which consists mainly of phytoplankton, to a higher trophic level diet containing mesozooplankton, was detected. The capacity for adults to consume more zooplankton food items may minimize their food competition with juveniles, which rely mostly on phytoplankton food items. This suggests "diet shift with ontogeny" which may somehow help krill keep their dietary energy budget balanced and well adapted to the Antarctic marine ecosystem as a dominant species.																	0253-505X	1869-1099				DEC	2017	36	12					67	78		10.1007/s13131-017-1049-4							WOS:000417883300009

First, a specific antiserum to P. antarctica was produced and tested on phytoplankton cells and extracts. Then, the antiserum was tested on extracts of stomachs from krill fed diets of either Thalassiosira antarctica or P. antarctica, and also on mixtures of these extracts. The antiserum response was a logarithmic function of the percentage of the extract mixture that came from P. antarctica-fed krill. In the field, the antiserum was tested on krill collected during December 1996 to February 1997 in the Palmer Long-Term Ecological Research study region west of the Antarctic Peninsula. The antiserum. response suggested that krill ingested P. antarctica at 20% of the stations tested, most of them in nearshore areas. Krill grazed P. antarctica only at stations where concentrations of the marker pigment for P. antarctica, 19'-hexanoyloxyfucoxanthin, were above 0.150 mug l(-1). At these stations, the percentage of P. antarctica in the krill stomach extracts was positively correlated with chlorophyll a concentrations, but negatively correlated with the proportion of P. antarctica within the phytoplankton community. Overall, P. antarctica appeared to comprise a relatively small proportion of the phytoplankton utilized by krill, both spatially and temporally.

THE USE OF PATENT DATABASES TO PREDICT TRENDS IN THE KRILL FISHERY	CCAMLR SCIENCE												The fishery for Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) caught 210 000 tonnes in 2009/10 with vessels from six of CCAMLR's 25 Members participating in the fishery. Trends in the krill fishery are currently informed by data on annual catches and by CCAMLR's annual notification procedure. There has been considerable discussion within the Scientific Committee over the utility of these sources of information to detect trends in the fishery, and of the need to obtain more information from the krill industry so that developments that affect future catches can be predicted. This paper uses publicly available patent databases to examine both the number and type of patents related to krill that are lodged annually. This information shows similar trends to the catch and notification information, and the three sources of information can be used in combination to provide information to the Commission on potential changes in the krill fishery. The Scientific Committee has recommended that the patent database be maintained by the Secretariat so that it can annually update a register of krill-related patents which will be of use for indicating potential future trends in the krill fishery.

Combined effects of ocean acidification and elevated temperature on feeding, growth, and physiological processes of Antarctic krill Euphausia superba	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												Antarctic krill Euphausia superba is a key species in the Southern Ocean, where its habitat is projected to undergo continued warming and increases in pCO(2). Experiments during 2 summer field seasons at Palmer Station, Antarctica, investigated the independent and interactive effects of elevated temperature and pCO(2) (decreased pH) on feeding, growth, acid-base physiology, metabolic rate, and survival of adult Antarctic krill. Ingestion and clearance rates of chlorophyll were depressed under low pH (7.7) compared to ambient pH (8.1) after a 48 h acclimation period, but this difference disappeared after a 21 d acclimation. Growth rates were negligible and frequently negative, but were significantly more negative at high (3 degrees C, -0.03 mm d(-1)) compared to ambient temperature (0 degrees C, -0.01 mm d(-1)) with no effect of pH. Modest elevations in tissue total CO2 and tissue pH were apparent at low pH but were short-lived. Metabolic rate increased with temperature but was suppressed at low pH in smaller but not larger krill. Although effects of elevated temperature and/or decreased pH were mostly sublethal, mortality was higher at high temperature/low pH (58%) compared to ambient temperature/pH or ambient temperature/low pH (> 90%). This study identified 3 dominant patterns: (1) shorter-term effects were primarily pH-dependent; (2) krill compensated for lower pH relatively quickly; and (3) longer-term effects on krill growth and survival were strongly driven by temperature with little to no pH effect.																	0171-8630	1616-1599				APR 29	2021	665						1	18		10.3354/meps13715							WOS:000649299900001

We examined the spatial distributions of pelagic seabirds and tur seals near South Georgia, and asked to what extent the distributions of these predators were influenced by the spatial distribution of their principal prey, Antarctic krill Euphausia superba Dana. One novel aspect of our analysis is an explicit consideration of the separation in space between swarms of krill and aggregations of predators that feed upon krill. 2. Our data were collected in February 1986, during a systematic shipboard survey of the waters surrounding Bird Island, South Georgia. Predator abundance was estimated visually using strip transects, and krill abundance was simultaneously estimated using a hull-mounted echosounder. 3. We approached the difficult analytical problems associated with spatial distributions of organisms by using spatial autocorrelation and cross-correlation analysis, regression models with spatial terms, and randomization tests. The randomization tests involved repeated simulations of predator distributions, and subsequent estimation of spatial association between predators and prey. 4. Pelagic birds and seals were distributed in a strikingly non-random fashion at sea near South Georgia; their distributional patterns were strongly influenced by the distribution of krill swarms. 5. Differences between predators in their spatial distribution and in their response to krill swarms suggest interspecific differences in foraging strategies.																	0021-8790						1993	62	3					551	564		10.2307/5204							WOS:A1993LK28200015						
J	SUN, S; DELAMARE, W; NICOL, S				SUN, S; DELAMARE, W; NICOL, S			THE COMPOUND EYE AS AN INDICATOR OF AGE AND SHRINKAGE IN ANTARCTIC KRILL	ANTARCTIC SCIENCE												Laboratory studies have shown that Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) shrink if maintained in conditions of low food availability. Recent studies have also demonstrated that E. superba individuals may be shrinking in the field during winter. If krill shrink during the winter, conclusions reached by length-frequency analysis may be unreliable because smaller animals may not necessarily be younger animals. In this study, the correlation between the body-length and the crystalline cone number of the compound eye was examined. Samples collected in the late summer show an apparent linear relationship between crystalline cone number and body-length. From a laboratory population, it appears that when krill shrink the crystalline cone number remains relatively unchanged. If crystalline cone number is little affected by shrinking, then the crystalline cone number may be a more reliable indicator of age than body-length alone. The ratio of crystalline cone number to body-length offers a method for detecting the effect of shrinking in natural populations of krill. On the basis of the crystalline cone number count, it appears from a field collection in early spring that E. superba do shrink during winter.																	0954-1020					DEC	1995	7	4					387	392		10.1017/S0954102095000538							WOS:A1995TH80600007

Dynamic histological analysis on days 11, 24, and 35 postsurgery showed that PP-AKP promoted hypertrophy and mineralization of cartilage callus, formation of new bone tissue, and remodeling of boney callus. Biomechanical property tests on day 35 postsurgery demonstrated that PP-AKP significantly improved callus stiffness. Real-time PCR analysis showed that on day 11 postsurgery, PP-AKP significantly decreased mRNA expression of aggrecan and collagen type X (Col10a), and increased vascular endothelial growth factor level, suggesting that it promoted chondrocytes hypertrophy and vascular invasion. On day 24 postsurgery, PP-AKP significantly decreased matrix metalloproteinase 13 expression, and increased expression of collagen type I and bone gla protein, suggesting that it promoted cartilage matrix degradation and new bone formation. Practical applicationsAs a novel food material, Antarctic Krill possesses an enormous biomass (0.65-1 billion tons) and utilization potential. It has the largest amount of protein among reported organisms worldwide with better biological value than other animal proteins. This study demonstrated that phosphorylated peptides from Antarctic Krill could promote osteoporotic fracture healing on ovariectomized mice by facilitating endochondral ossification, which may provide theoretical basis for use of Antarctic Krill protein as bone protective functional food in future.																	0145-8884	1745-4514				DEC	2017	41	6							e12408	10.1111/jfbc.12408							WOS:000417120500007

We projected growth trajectories for individual krill within cohorts and estimated how total biomass in an area available to both predators and the fishery may vary from year to year simply due to fluctuations in temperature. We used an existing temperature-dependent growth model and a time series of temperature data (1970 to 2004) for 2 regions in the Southern Ocean: (1) around the Antarctic Peninsula, and (2) around the island of South Georgia. The growth model predicted increasing individual size within a cohort (in terms of length and weight) with increasing temperature in the cooler Antarctic Peninsula region and decreasing individual size with increasing temperature in the warmer South Georgia region. Years with many cohorts of small individuals in the population resulted in biomass well below average, whereas years with many cohorts of large individuals resulted in biomass well above the average, suggesting that temporal changes in Southern Ocean temperatures may have profound effects on the total biomass in an area that is available to both predators and the fishery. Moreover, the effects of a potentially warming Southern Ocean on krill biomass will likely be more pronounced in the warmer regions occupied by krill.

J	Shin, HC; Nicol, S				Shin, HC; Nicol, S			Using the relationship between eye diameter and body length to detect the effects of long-term starvation on Antarctic krill Euphausia superba	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												Body shrinkage may be one of the strategies that Antarctic krill use to cope with food scarcity, particularly during winter. Despite their demonstrated ability to shrink, there are only very limited data to determine how commonly shrinkage occurs in the wild. It has been previously shown that laboratory-shrunk krill tend to conserve the size of the eye. This study examined whether the relationship between the eye diameter and body length could be used to detect whether krill had been shrinking, By tracking individuals over time and examining specimens sampled as groups, it was demonstrated that fed and starved krill are distinguishable by the relationship between the eye diameter and body length. The eye diameter of starved krill did not decrease, even when the animals had shrunk in overall body length, The eye diameter of well-fed krill continued to increase as overall length increased. This created a distinction between fed and starved krill, while no separation was detected in terms of the body length to weight relationship. Eye growth of krill re-commenced with re-growth of krill following shrinkage although there was some time lag. It would take approximately 2 moult cycles of shrinkage at modest rates to significantly change the eye diameter to body length relationship between normal and shrunk krill. If krill starve for a prolonged period in the wild, and hence shrink, the eye diameter to body length relationship should be able to indicate this, This would be particularly noticeable at the end of winter.																	0171-8630						2002	239						157	167		10.3354/meps239157							WOS:000178175000015

After a period of taxonomic work and the description of several synonyms, detailed studies on the morphology, internal anatomy and general biology of this species commenced with the 'Discovery' investigations beginning in the 1920s. During the BIOMASS project (Biological Investigations Of Marine Antarctic Systems and Stocks) in the 1980s, studies expanded on the biology and ecology of Antarctic krill, including all aspects of zoogeography and zooplankton community structure. The developing krill fishery and the establishment of CCAMLR (Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources) resulted in the pressing need for more quantitative data, which required the use of standardized methods of surveying, sampling, and measuring krill. Despite krill becoming one of the most well-known marine species, many questions remain unanswered and require - in addition to well-established methods - different or even new approaches in future krill research.																	2468-5712		978-3-319-29279-3; 978-3-319-29277-9				2016							1	19		10.1007/978-3-319-29279-3_1	10.1007/978-3-319-29279-3						WOS:000401843300002

Ability of the proteins to stabilize sunflower oil-based emulsions was firstly evaluated, and further the effects of NaCl concentration, pH values and storage temperatures on their stabilization were investigated. Results showed that the krill proteins contained much balanced essential amino acids compared to some plant proteins, and hydrophobic interactions and disulfide bonds greatly contributed to the development and stabilization of the protein aggregates. Antarctic krill proteins formed emulsions with their particle size less than 20 mu m under 3%-4% protein and oil/water ratios of 3:7-5:5. Moreover, higher krill proteins content (>= 3%), lower NaCl concentration (<= 100 mM) or higher temperatures (>= 40 degrees C) greatly favored the formation of gel-like networks of emulsions. Notably, the emulsions stabilized by 3% Antarctic krill proteins and oil/water ratio of 3:7 could resist the fluctuation of pH (3-9), salt concentration (50-400 mM) and temperatures (4-60 degrees C). Meanwhile, the emulsions exhibited a comparable long-term stability after 30 days storage compared to the existing proteins or biopolymers-stabilized emulsions. This study expends the knowledges of constructing novel Antarctic krill proteins-stabilized emulsions to unlock the high value-added utilization of marine protein resources in food industry.																	0023-6438	1096-1127				JUN	2020	128								109492	10.1016/j.lwt.2020.109492							WOS:000540290000049						
J	Hagen, W; VanVleet, ES; Kattner, G				Hagen, W; VanVleet, ES; Kattner, G			Seasonal lipid storage as overwintering strategy of Antarctic krill	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												Conflicting hypotheses prevail on the overwintering strategies of the Antarctic krill Euphausia superba due to the difficult accessibility of Antarctic waters, especially in winter, and hence, to the lack of seasonal data. This study reports on the seasonal lipid dynamics of E. superba (25 to 56 mm) collected in the Weddell Sea in late winter/spring, summer, autumn and mid-winter. Total lipid data provide evidence of large seasonal accumulation of reserve lipids in austral summer with a mean Lipid content of 28.2% of dry mass and particularly in autumn, when mean lipid levels peak with 39.2% of dry mass. After the overwintering period mean lipid contents decrease to a minimum of 10.5% of dry mass, indicating extensive utilisation of lipid reserves during winter. These data suggest that lipids contribute significantly to the overwintering success of this extremely versatile species. Lipid class analyses of spring and summer specimens (10 to 56 mm) from the Antarctic Peninsula and the Weddell Sea revealed that not only triacylglycerol, but also phosphatidylcholine may serve as important storage lipids of E. superba. In the other dominant Antarctic krill species, E. crystallorophias (10 to 40 mm) and Thysanoessa macrura (10 to 27 mm), wax esters are the primary depot lipid, but phosphatidylcholine also functions as a storage lipid in these species. Phosphatidylcholine is unusual as a reserve lipid, being an essential component of biomembranes. In contrast, phosphatidylethanolamine, the other major phospholipid class, seems to have exclusively membrane functions, since it does not increase (in percent of dry mass) with increasing lipid levels in these 3 euphausiid species.

Knowing the selective properties between trawls is crucial information for the management of the krill resources. This study compared the catch patterns between different commercial krill trawls at similar times and overlapping fishing grounds based on scientific data collected by scientific observers onboard commercial trawlers Long Teng (LT) and Fu Rong Hai (FRH). The results showed significant differences in the length-dependent catch densities and cumulative catch densities of krill between the two trawls. The krill length range in catches from LT's trawl was wider than that of FRH's trawl. Furthermore, the catch would consist of a larger proportion of smaller krill in the LT's trawl. The LT's trawl caught significantly higher proportions of krill below 38 mm than FRH's trawl. Even, the LT's trawl caught substantial numbers of krill <30 mm, whereas the FRH's trawl caught very few of them. The main factors causing the difference between trawls in catch pattern were inferred to be related to gear design including differences in mesh sizes used. The results of this study enhance the quality of comparative analysis of scientific data from commercial trawls and the understanding of gear selectivity of different configuration trawls used for harvesting krill.</p>																		2296-7745				SEP 28	2021	8								670663	10.3389/fmars.2021.670663							WOS:000706165500001

In this study, Antarctic krill lipid extraction conditions using subcritical n-butane were investigated and optimized by response surface methodology. The optimal extraction conditions using sub critical n-butane were, 120 min dynamic extractions at 40 degrees C and 1.0 MPa. Lipids extracted by the subcritical n-butane were further compared with those extracted by supercritical CO2 and traditional solvents. Results indicated that the lipid extraction by using subcritical n-butane had a higher lipid recovery rate (81.2 +/- 1.5%), higher astaxanthin content (248.4 +/- 5.2 mg/kg) and the highest tocopherol content (67.7 +/- 3.2 mg/kg). Furthermore, the lipids' volatile components and flavor components were further investigated. Results revealed that the lipid extracted by subcritical n-butane had lower 1-Penten-3-ol and aldehydes content, indicating less lipid oxidation and higher sulfur-containing compounds which might contribute to the overall aroma of Antarctic krill lipid. Additionally, Antarctic krill lipid extracted by subcritical n-butane had a higher lipid recovery rate and better nutritional quality.

The range of the dB identification window for krill length was between 28 mm and 67 mm and the distribution of swimming orientation N[11.0 degrees, 4.0 degrees] was estimated to be between 0.06-10.97 dB, while the range estimated using N[53.1 degrees, 21.4 degrees], i.e., the distribution of orientation obtained under the brightest illuminance level, was 5.21-9.82 dB. The range of the dB window calculated using N[45.2 degrees, 23.0 degrees], obtained under the second brightest illuminance level, was 3.83-11.76 dB, and the range calculated with N[48.1 degrees, 23.0 degrees], obtained under the third illuminance level, was 3.83-11.76 dB. The range of the dB window calculated by N[45.9 degrees, 23.0 degrees] was 3.41-11.75 dB, and the range of the dB window for krill length ranging from 28 mm to 67 mm was 4.05-11.34 dB. In all the swimming orientations, the smaller the krill size was the lower the averaged target strength value was; likewise, the larger the krill size was the higher the averaged target strength value was. The result indicated that swimming orientation impacted greatly on the range of frequency differences of Antarctic krill.																	1738-5261	2005-7172				SEP	2020	55	3					391	403		10.1007/s12601-020-0031-9		SEP 2020					WOS:000566310300004						
J	Sun, JN; Mao, XZ				Sun, Jianan; Mao, Xiangzhao			An environmental friendly process for Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) utilization using fermentation technology	JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION												Antarctic krill was efficiently fermented by Bacillus subtilis OKF04 after the optimization of fermentation conditions. Bio-active substances were detected in fermentation broth, including polypeptides (9.5 g/L), phenols (1.1 g/L), polysaccharides (200.8 mg/L), and free amino acids (3469.4 mg/L). The fermentation broth was found to be rich in essential amino acids and non-protein amino acids, particularly methionine, leucine, lysine, and taurine. The fermentation broth was separated into 4 fractions: AKF-I (<1 kDa), AKF-II (1-3 kDa), AKF-III (3-5 kDa), and AKF-IV (>5 kDa), using membrane ultrafiltration. Antioxidative properties of the fermentation broth fractions were investigated, using DPPH (2, 2-diphenyl-1-picryl-hydrazyl-hydrate) scavenging activity, metal chelating activity and reducing capacity. The results showed that AKF-I and AKF-II had higher antioxidant activities than other fractions and the entire fermentation broth. These results indicate that bio-active substrates could be effectively and cleanly produced using fermentation of Antarctic krill by B. subtilis, and the antioxidant activity (DPPH scavenging activity, metal chelating activity and reducing capacity) of the fermentation broth is enhanced by ultrafiltration.

Impact of climate change on Antarctic krill	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												Antarctic krill Euphausia superba (hereafter 'krill') occur in regions undergoing rapid environmental change, particularly loss of winter sea ice. During recent years, harvesting of krill has in creased, possibly enhancing stress on krill and Antarctic ecosystems. Here we review the overall impact of climate change on krill and Antarctic ecosystems, discuss implications for an ecosystem-based fisheries management approach and identify critical knowledge gaps. Sea ice decline, ocean warming and other environmental stressors act in concert to modify the abundance, distribution and life cycle of krill. Although some of these changes can have positive effects on krill, their cumulative impact is most likely negative. Recruitment, driven largely by the winter survival of larval krill, is probably the population parameter most susceptible to climate change. Predicting changes to krill populations is urgent, because they will seriously impact Antarctic ecosystems. Such predictions, however, are complicated by an intense inter-annual variability in recruitment success and krill abundance. To improve the responsiveness of the ecosystem-based management approach adopted by the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR), critical knowledge gaps need to be filled. In addition to a better understanding of the factors influencing recruitment, management will require a better understanding of the resilience and the genetic plasticity of krill life stages, and a quantitative understanding of under-ice and benthic habitat use. Current precautionary management measures of CCAMLR should be maintained until a better understanding of these processes has been achieved.

Ideally, fermentation technology can be applied to transform them into a popular condiment. In addition to the exploration of protease properties, the present study aimed to evaluate proteinase activity, pH, amino nitrogen, and histamine formation during fermentation at different temperatures and salt treatments. RESULTS: Even though the activity of Antarctic krill protease reached a maximum at 40 degrees C and pH 7, it was stable at 30 degrees C and pH 7-9. Among the metal ions tested, Ca2+, Mg2+ and K+ increased protease activity, in contrast to Zn2+ and Cu2+. Within each treatment, the highest protease activity and amino nitrogen content, aswell as the lowest histamine level, were observed on day 12 of fermentation. Treatment at 35 degrees C with 180 g kg(-1) salt led to the production of maximum amino nitrogen (0.0352 g kg(-1)) and low histamine (<= 0.0497 g kg(-1)). CONCLUSION: Krill paste fermented for 12 days at 35 degrees C with 180 g kg(-1) salt exhibited the optimal quality and properties, suggesting an efficientmethod for fermentation of Antarctic krill and other aquatic resources.

Additionally, the influence of fatty acid composition on AST degradation in the three types of KO was compared. The results revealed that the degradation of AST followed first-order kinetics, and the temperature dependence of the reaction was well explained by the Arrhenius relationship. A high storage temperature led to faster AST degradation. AST degradation rates under nitrogen were lower than those under an oxygen atmosphere. The higher degradation rate of AST in PKO is ascribed to its higher level of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) in comparison to WKO and TKO. This is the first time the energy of activation of AST degradation was evaluated to determine how the fatty acid composition of the oil matrix and storage atmosphere affect the reaction kinetics.																	0003-021X	1558-9331				SEP	2018	95	9					1171	1178		10.1002/aocs.12129							WOS:000443231900005

Multibeam echosounder observations reveal interactions between Antarctic krill and air-breathing predators	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												A multibeam echosounder (MBE) was deployed on an inflatable boat (length = 5.5 m) to observe swarms of Antarctic krill Euphausia superba in the nearshore environment off Livingston Island, South Shetland Islands, Antarctica. Visual observations of air-breathing predators, including penguins and fur seals, were made from the boat at the same time. MBEs extend the 2-dimensional acoustic observations that can be made with conventional vertical echosounders to 3 dimensions, enabling direct observation of the surface areas and volumes of entire krill swarms. Krill swarms exhibited a wide range of various size metrics (e.g. height, length and width) but only a narrow range of surf ace-area-to-volume ratios or 'roughnesses', suggesting that krill adopt a consistent group behavior to maintain swarm shape. The variation in R was investigated using generalized additive models (GAMs). GAMs indicated that the presence of air-breathing predators influenced swarm shape (R decreased as the range to predators decreased, and the swarms became more spherical), as did swarm nearest-neighbor distance (R decreased with increasing distance) and swarm position in the water column (R decreased in the upper 70% of the water column). Therefore, swarm shape appears to be influenced by a combination of behavioral responses to predator presence and environmental variables. MBEs have the potential to contribute much to studies of krill, and can provide data to improve our understanding of the behavior of krill in situ.

Overwinter habitat selection by Antarctic krill under varying sea-ice conditions: implications for top predators and fishery management	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												Climate change will affect Antarctic krill Euphausia superba, krill-dependent predators, and fisheries in the Southern Ocean as areas typically covered by sea ice become ice-free in some winters. Research cruises conducted around the South Shetland Islands of the Antarctic Peninsula during winters with contrasting ice conditions provide the first acoustic estimates of krill biomass, habitat use, and association with top predators to examine potential interactions with the krill fishery. Krill abundance was very low in offshore waters during all winters. In Bransfield Strait, median krill abundance was an order of magnitude higher (8 krill m(-2)) compared to summer (0.25 krill m(-2)), and this pattern was ob served in all winters regardless of ice cover. Acoustic estimates of krill biomass were also an order of magnitude higher (similar to 5 500 000 metric tons [t] in 2014) than a 15 yr summer average (520 000 t). Looking at krill-dependent predators, during winter, crabeater seals Lobodon carcinophagus were concentrated in Brans-field Strait where ice provided habitat, while Antarctic fur seals Arctocephalus gazella were more broadly distributed. Krill overwinter in coastal basin environments independent of ice and primary production and in an area that is becoming more frequently ice-free. While long-term projections of climate change have focused on changing krill habitat and productivity declines, more immediate impacts of ongoing climate change include increased risks of negative fishery-krill-predator interactions, alteration of upper trophic level community structure, and changes in the pelagic ecology of this system. Development of management strategies to mitigate the increased risk to krill populations and their dependent predators over management timescales will be necessary to minimize the impacts of long-term climate change.

In this study, iron -binding peptides were isolated from Antarctic krill using enzymatic (trypsin) hydrolysis and im- mobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC); the binding mode and surface morphology of Antarctic krill peptides (AKP)-iron complexes as well as their iron delivery behavior in the gastrointestinal tract were in-vestigated. Results showed that the AKP bound 79.3% of available iron from the enzymatic hydrolysis for 180 min. The contents of negatively-charged amino acids (Asp and Glu) on the AKP showed a positive corre-lation (r = 0.80) with iron-binding activities (the data includes Asn and Gln), while positively-charged amino acids showed a negative correlation (r = -0.83). Moreover, His, Ser and Thr on the AKP were also involved in the iron-binding activities. Iron-binding peptides from Antarctic krill hydrolysates, isolated using IMAC-Fe3+ and identified using HPLC-MS/MS, showed a mass of 712-2451 Da, and were enriched in Asp (Asn), Glu (Gln), His, Ser or Thr. The iron ions mainly bound to carboxyl groups of AKP, thus forming nano-scale, spherical particles. The iron nanocarriers formed by AKP showed a significant iron transport activity after simulated gastrointestinal digestion, as compared to FeSO 4 (P < 0.05). The results suggested that the AKP-iron nano - composite has the potential to be a nutraceutical supplement for improving iron absorption.																	2212-4292	2212-4306				AUG	2020	36								100657	10.1016/j.fbio.2020.100657							WOS:000549901100005

Growth trends with sex, length, season, and region	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												Growth trends of Antarctic krill with sex, length, season, and region as independent variables were modelled with a linear mixed model (LMM) using 10 yr of accumulated instantaneous growth rate (IGR) measurements. A model of inter-moult period (IMP) as a function of temperature, required to convert IGR to daily growth rate, was fitted to data from published constant-tempera lure rearing studies; this model was used to predict seasonal IMP using a model of the average sea surface temperature seasonal trend for each region. Smaller krill exhibited higher growth rates and, in general, we observed a progressive decrease in IGR and daily growth with increasing size (from over 0.2 mm d(-1) down to 0.05 mm d(-1) for 20 and 50 rum krill, respectively, in December in the Indian Ocean sector of the Southern Ocean). IGR decreased from summer to autumn, with small to negative values predominating across all length classes by autumn. December was a period of rapid growth in the Indian Ocean sector of the Southern Ocean, whereas a similar peak in growth rates appeared to occur a few months earlier in the southwest Atlantic sector. Significantly lower growth rates were exhibited by females in January and February (e.g. 0.063 and 0.050 mm d(-1) for 40 mm females) compared to males (0.119 and 0.090 mm d(-1) for 40 mm males) in the Indian Ocean sector. Since these estimates were based on growth measurements of individual animals, they may reflect the occurrence of sex-differentiated growth patterns in the natural environment. Growth rate differences between sexes Suggested that growth rate estimates based on composite length frequency distributions without sex differentiation may be problematic.

Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) extracted from Antarctic krill is an optical isomer of common DHA and has a much stronger anti-neoplastic effect. In this work, the migration and invasion abilities of MCF-7 cells treated with low concentrations of Antarctic krill DHA were evaluated. Low concentrations of Antarctic krill DHA significantly reduced the numbers of migrating and invasive MCF-7 cells, whereas the cell numbers decreased slowly in the CD95-silenced MCF-7 cells, which implies that CD95 might be involved in cell migration and invasion. Additionally, co-immunoprecipitation and Western blotting demonstrated that Antarctic krill DHA induced the accumulation of CD95 and caveolin-1 interaction, resulting in the down-regulation of MMP2 expression through the FAK/SRC/PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. In conclusion, Antarctic krill DHA enhanced the interaction between CD95 and caveolin-1, which may led to an inhibitory effect on cell migration and invasion via the FAK/SRC/PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. Our study indicates that Antarctic krill DHA has great potential for tumor therapy and has revealed a new metastatic mechanism mediated by the interaction of CD95 with caveolin-1.																	0024-3205	1879-0631				JAN 1	2018	192						270	277		10.1016/j.lfs.2017.11.011							WOS:000418477800035	29129771

Gaussian component analysis of krill samples, pooled by sectors, showed three cohorts of Euphausia superba in the western sector and one in the eastern sector. Across the sampling area, Thysanoessa mactura and E. superba occurred at separate stations. Analysis of cohorts in T macrura separated two size groups in both the western and the eastern sectors. The use of a Differentiation Index (D.I.) [Farber-Lorda, J., 1990. Somatic length relationships and ontogenetic morphometric differentiation of Euphausia superba and Thysanoessa macrura of the southwest Indian Ocean during summer (February 1981). Deep-Sea Res. 37,1135-1143.], based on somatic lengths, allows studying certain morphological differences within the populations sampled. Morphologically different and bigger males 11 (D.I. from 2.8 to 3.5) were present only in the southern transect while smaller males I (D.I. from 3.5 to 5.0) were present over the entire area. Biochemical composition of both species showed significant differences among stations for protein, lipids, and carbohydrates. A significant difference in lipid content was found between males I, and males II. For T macrura, percentage of lipid content in mature animals was much higher than that in E. superba. The D.I. size distribution showed that when populations of E. superba were highly differentiated (corresponding to mature animals) in morphology, lipid content was high, and they were located near a gyre. Differences in morphometry can influence distribution of the species, because different developing stages have different swimming capacities. It is shown that, together with hydrography and trophic conditions, lipid content and morphometry of krill populations, are different but complementary aspects that help to understand krill ecology and distribution.

J	Meyer, B				Meyer, Bettina			The overwintering of Antarctic krill, Euphausia superba, from an ecophysiological perspective	POLAR BIOLOGY												A major aim of this review is to determine which physiological functions are adopted by adults and larvae to survive the winter season with low food supply and their relative importance. A second aim is to clarify the extent to which seasonal variation in larval and adult krill physiology is mediated by environmental factors with a strong seasonality, such as food supply or day light. Experimental studies on adult krill have demonstrated that specific physiological adaptations during autumn and winter, such as reduced metabolic rates and feeding activity, are not caused simply by the scarcity of food, as was previously assumed. These adaptations appear to be influenced by the local light regime. The physiological functions that larval krill adopt during winter (reduced metabolism, delayed development, lipid utilisation, and variable growth rates) are, in contrast to the adults, under direct control by the available food supply. During winter, the adults often seem to have little association with sea ice (at least until early spring). The larvae, however, feed within sea ice but mainly on the grazers of the ice algal community rather than on the algae themselves. In this respect, a miss-match in timing of the occurrence of the last phytoplankton blooms in autumn and the start of the sea ice formation, as has been increasingly observed in the west Antarctic Peninsula (WAP) region, will impact larval krill development during winter in terms of food supply and consequently the krill stock in this region.

A vessel-mounted acoustic Doppler current profiler (ADCP) and a calibrated EK-60 echo sounder were used to assess circulation patterns and krill distributions in the bay, and a multiple opening and closing net (with 333 mu m mesh) and environmental sensing system (MOCNESS) was used to collect live samples of mesozooplankton and krill for taxonomic composition analysis. The results from this field study complement a previous one that examined an anticyclonic bay-scale circulation of Antarctic krill. This super-aggregation of krill covered similar to 100 km(2), had a concentration of 1000s of individuals m(-2) and was associated with more than 306 humpback whales present in Wilhelmina Bay. Our results from the mesozooplankton study revealed that krill continuously conducted diel vertical migrations and formed aggregations in the inner bay, while the chlorophyll concentration at the surface decreased from 2.2 to 0.6 g C m(-2) due to the decrease of daylight, and zooplankton concentrations increased from 0.5 to 1.5 g C m(-2) probably from advective influx. Most zooplankton were distributed below 200 m while krill fed in the upper 150 m. The spatial and temporal correlations between krill and small-to medium-sized mesozooplankton imply that krill may become omnivorous when there is a lack of phytoplankton in the late austral fall. Though both phytoplankton and zooplankton biomasses contributed only small fractions of the daily ration needed for krill metabolism in Wilhelmina Bay, it is not clear what caused krill to aggregate on such a large scale, as this led to high mortality as a result of starvation and predation by whales and other top predators.

The potential role of Antarctic krill faecal pellets in efficient carbon export at the marginal ice zone of the South Orkney Islands in spring	POLAR BIOLOGY												Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) play a central role in the food web of the Southern Ocean, forming a link between primary production and large predators. Krill produce large, faecal pellets (FP) which can form a large component of mesopelagic particulate organic carbon (POC) fluxes. However, the patchy distribution of krill swarms, highly variable pellet composition, and variable sinking and attenuation rates means that these episodic, but potentially large, carbon fluxes are difficult to sample or model. We measured particle flux and type using Marine Snow Catchers (MSC) in the marginal ice zone near the South Orkneys, Antarctica. Krill FP were the dominant component of the POC flux in the upper 200 m (typically 60-85%). FP sinking velocities measured onboard were highly variable (15-507 m d(-1)) but overall high, with mean equivalent velocities of 172, 267, and 161 m d(-1) at our three stations. The high numbers of krill FP sinking through the mesopelagic suggest that krill FP can be transferred efficiently and/or that rates of krill FP production are high. We compared our direct MSC-derived estimates of krill FP POC flux (33-154 mg C m(-2) d(-1)) and attenuation to estimates of krill FP production based on previous measurements of krill density and literature FP egestion rates, and estimated net krill FP attenuation rates in the upper mesopelagic. Calculated attenuation rates are sensitive to krill densities in the overlying water column but suggest that krill FP could be transferred efficiently through the upper mesopelagic, and, in agreement with our MSC attenuation estimates, could make large contributions to bathypelagic POC fluxes. Our study contrasts with some others which suggest rapid FP attenuation, highlighting the need for further work to constrain attenuation rates and assess how important the contribution of Antarctic krill FP could be to the Southern Ocean biological carbon pump.

The results show the existence of a shelf break front during each period. The most reliable means of defining the front was the potential density anomaly at the near-surface potential temperature minimum. In each year, off-shelf waters were separated from on-shelf waters by water with a potential density anomaly between 27.22 and 27.29 kg m(-3). During 1997/98, the near-surface potential temperature minimum was much colder and much shallower than in other years and was consistent with waters originating from much further south than South Georgia; these differences were further evident at a single deep off-shelf station. The oceanographic changes during 1997/98 were consistent with a mesoscale or large-scale movement of the southern Antarctic Circumpolar Current front. Acoustically determined densities of Antarctic krill, Euphausia superba, at South Georgia showed consistent patterns between years. Densities were substantially higher over the shelf compared with off-shelf, with the highest densities at the shelf edge; densities were also higher to the east of the island. During 1997/98, acoustic densities of krill were substantially higher than in other years. The coincidence of the elevated acoustic density and the cooler oceanographic conditions was explored. When data from all years were combined and analysed by Generalized Additive Model, an inverse relationship between acoustic density and temperature was apparent. Historical data were also examined and it was noted that the only other occurrence of such a high estimate of krill density at South Georgia, was when oceanographic conditions were also colder.

Swarms of diversity at the gene cox1 in Antarctic krill	HEREDITY												The Antarctic krill, Euphausia superba, is an abundant and key species found in the Southern Ocean that forms dense, discrete swarms. Despite over three decades of research on Antarctic krill, the genetics of individual swarms is yet to be specifically investigated. In this study, we address the genetic diversity, population structure and demographic history of nine Antarctic krill swarms by sequencing 1173 bases of the gene cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (cox1, COI) from 504 individuals. Both haplotype diversity (h = 0.9974-1.0000) and nucleotide diversity (pi = 0.010275-0.011537) of Antarctic krill swarm samples was consistently high compared with populations of other species reported in the literature. Analysis of molecular variance did not show any significant genetic structure, thus implying that the sampled swarms do not appear to reflect discrete genetic units. Fu's Fs and Bayesian Skyride analyses provided strong evidence for a large increase in the population size of Antarctic krill, or selection favouring a particular mitochondrial lineage, within the last few 100 000 years (Pleistocene). The swarm-level results presented in this study not only further our understanding of Antarctic krill biology but, because of the economical importance of this species, also provide data to consider for future krill stock management.

The importance of Antarctic krill in biogeochemical cycles	NATURE COMMUNICATIONS												Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) are swarming, oceanic crustaceans, up to two inches long, and best known as prey for whales and penguins - but they have another important role. With their large size, high biomass and daily vertical migrations they transport and transform essential nutrients, stimulate primary productivity and influence the carbon sink. Antarctic krill are also fished by the Southern Ocean's largest fishery. Yet how krill fishing impacts nutrient fertilisation and the carbon sink in the Southern Ocean is poorly understood. Our synthesis shows fishery management should consider the influential biogeochemical role of both adult and larval Antarctic krill.

ANTARCTIC SCIENCE					9th Scar International Biology Symposium	JUL 25-29, 2005	Curitiba, BRAZIL					Antarctic krill are a key species in the Southern Ocean ecosystem, and their life cycle appears to be correlated with, and by implication dependent upon, seasonal sea ice dynamics. Moving from correlations with environmental parameters to an understanding of the mechanisms that lead to these correlations may allow predictions of the consequences of climate change on the distribution of favourable habitat for Antarctic krill. During winter cruises in 2001 and 2002 in the region west of the Antarctic Peninsula, one of the most rapidly warming regions on the planet, ice camps were established for periods of 3-9 days. Timing of sea ice advance, chlorophyll a concentrations in ice cores, and growth rates and pigment content of larval krill all differed significantly between winters. Growth rates and pigment content of larval krill from the same ice floe were correlated, suggesting that growth rates in winter are a function of the biomass of the sea ice microbial community. A possible mechanism underlying the correlation between recruitment success and timing of ice advance is proposed. In conjunction with other postulated habitat requirements, this proposed mechanism allows for speculation about future changes in the geographic location of favourable habitat for Antarctic krill.																	0954-1020					JUN	2007	19	2					253	266		10.1017/S0954102007000363							WOS:000247196900014

We investigated survival rate of calyptopis larvae of Euphausia superba and late copepodite stages (IV and V) of large dominant calanoid species, Calanoides acutus and Calanus propinquus reared in quartz jars with three different radiation regimes (total radiation, exclusion of UVB, exclusion of UVA and UVB) and a dark control. The survival rates of the krill larvae decreased after 3 days from start of the experiment, being below 50% at 4 days in the treatments with total radiation and exclusion of UVB, although most individuals could survive until the end of the experiments in the treatments with exclusion of both UVA and UVB and dark control. The calanoid juveniles showed almost same pattern of survival curves as the krill larvae did, but survived slightly longer. Although > 10% of surface UVA radiation at 340 and 380 nm penetrated down to 30 m, both C. acutus and C. propinquus were mostly distributed above 20 m. Surface swarm of the krill larvae can be often recognized in the previous studies. These results suggest that not only solar UVB but also UVA radiation potentially lower the survival rate of Antarctic zooplankton at depth less than 20 m.

The results showed that the intermolecular hydrogen bond content of the composite fibers prepared after adding sulfates to the coagulation bath increased, and the crystallization and thermal properties were also improved. Among them, the performance of the composite fibers prepared in H2SO4/Na2SO4/KAl(SO4)(2) has improved significantly.

The contribution of ice algae to the winter energy budget of juvenile Antarctic krill in years with contrasting sea ice conditions	ICES JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE												Krill overwintering strategies vary with ontogeny and year; understanding this variability is essential to predicting how the species will respond to climate change in the future. Overwintering studies have focused on larval and adult krill, but we know little about how juvenile krill overwinter. The late winter diet of juvenile krill is important because it will determine their growth and development rates and consequently their reproductive potential the following spring. A diet rich in ice algae would promote growth and reproductive development. The Bransfield Strait (northern Antarctic Peninsula, AP) is an important overwintering ground for krill; it has been proposed this region offers a food-rich winter environment. We examined the contribution of ice algae to the energy budget of overwintering juvenile krill during 2 years with contrasting sea ice conditions. Grazing on ice algae contributed approximate to 146% to their winter energy budget in 2015, even though ice concentrations were 50% and consisted of newly formed pancake ice. However, when sea ice advanced late in the Bransfield Strait (2016), ice algae contributed significantly less (approximate to 16%) to the winter energy budget of juvenile krill. Delayed sea ice advance may negatively affect growth and reproductive development of overwintering juvenile krill.

It is the most abundant species of krill, which catchable stock is believed to amount up to 10 million tons per year, and may be the most potential marine resource for utilization as food in the world. This paper compared the nutritional components and heavy metals of edible portions of Antarctic krill, greasy-back shrimp (Metapenaeus ensis), Chinese white prawn (Exopalaemon modestus), and oriental river prawn (Macrobrachium nipponense). Antarctic krill meat contained 76.39% of water, 17.22% of crude proteins, 2.66% of crude lipids, and 1.43% of ashes, respectively. At dry basis, Antarctic krill had relatively lower content of crude protein (72.92%) than oriental river prawn (85.35%), greasy-back shrimp (81.12%), or Chinese white prawn (78.18%). However, it had significantly higher lipid content (11.25%) than the three species of shrimps (4.89%similar to 6.65%). And the total amino acids in dry samples of Antarctic krill meat was 74.46g/100g, which was lower than the shrimps, but the essential amino acid content (45.90g/100g protein) was higher than others. Regarding to minerals, no significant difference was found in Antarctic krill and the shrimps, with exceptions that Antarctic krill contained two to three times higher content of magnesium (458.28mg/100g) and copper (4.96mg/100g) than shrimps. In addition, the heavy metals including lead (Pb), mercury (Hg), arsenic (As), chromium (Cr) in Antarctic krill meat met the limit standard of contaminants in aquatic products. But fluorine content of Antarctic krill meat surpassed the safety limit (2.0mg/kg) and might be a safety concern.																	1022-6680		978-3-03785-268-2				2012	361-363						799	+		10.4028/www.scientific.net/AMR.361-363.799							WOS:000309373900147

This study aims to understand the distribution of biomass of zooplankton, especially the krill, using the data collected by net sampling techniques. Total zooplankton biomass for all the sampling stations ranged from 9 to 684 ml/1000 m3 (xBAR: 143.34 +/- 138.61 SD; n = 150). Biomass data grouped by 5-degrees latitude interval shows the presence of higher biomass (xBAR: 191 ml/1000 m3; n=31) in the Antarctic divergence region (between 60-degrees to 65-degrees-S). Euphausiid Euphausia superba DANA formed a considerable component of biomass and together with eggs and larvae represented over 60% (n = 39) of mean total zooplankton-biomass in the coastal ice region. The values for population density and biomass of adult-size krill varied between 0 to 4320 individuals and 6 to 305 ml/1000 m3, respectively. The highest values were recorded between 62-degrees to 69-degrees-S and between 16-degrees to 30-degrees-E. A high density of krill larvae was encountered in the shelf region during January 1987 which was related to chlorophyll concentration. However, the values obtained during six consecutive summers showed that values of adult krill biomass at given location was highly variable and, hence, not comparable on inter-annual basis, during the sampling years.

We found a new mixed solvent, 2 wt% glacial acetic acid, and 2 wt% ethylene glycol aqueous solution, to prepare a stable CS/AKP composite solution. Then we obtained CS/AKP fiber by wet-spinning on a lab-scale wet-spinning machine. The tensile strength of blended fibers is 2.53 cN/dtex in the dry state, which is improved by 11.9% compared with the CS fibers. We found that the increased tensile strength of the blended fibers is relative to the hydrogen bond formed between CS and AKP. Specifically, illustrate the restructured hydrogen bonds in CS/AKP system in Fourier transform infrared curve fitting. The hydrogen bond probably benefits on crystalline growth of CS along the fiber axis and is the main drivable factor in removing the water molecules in blended fibers. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

A preliminary model of iron fertilisation by baleen whales and Antarctic krill in the Southern Ocean: Sensitivity of primary productivity estimates to parameter uncertainty	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING												Large marine animals may play a crucial role in storing and recycling bioavailable iron in surface waters by consuming iron-rich prey and subsequent defecation of iron that is excess to their requirements. This biological recycling of iron could enhance primary productivity in iron-limited waters. However, quantifying the effects of marine animals on ocean primary productivity remains challenging because of a limited understanding of the key biogeochemical processes involved. In this paper, we develop a preliminary model that explores these uncertainties and examines the potential effects of historical populations of blue, fin and humpback whales, and the biomass of Antarctic krill required to support the whale populations, on primary productivity in the Southern Ocean. Our results suggest that, despite conservative estimates for key processes in our model, pre-exploitation populations of blue whales and, to a lesser extent fin and humpback whales, could have contributed to iron recycling, resulting in enhanced phytoplankton production in iron-limited Southern Ocean waters. Iron-rich defecation by un-exploited whale populations in the Southern Ocean, and the biomass Antarctic krill required to support them, could have resulted in a contribution to primary productivity of between 1.5 x 10(-4) to 23.4g Cm-2 yr(-1) (blue whales), 1.4x 10(-4) to 13.9 gC m(-2) yr(-1) (fin whales), and 2.4x 10(-5) to 1.7 g Cm-2 yr(-1) (humpback whales). However, only when all parameter estimates are at their upper limits does there appear to be this significant role for whales in enhancing primary productivity, and thus we need to assess the likelihood of these values arising. The high degree of uncertainty around the magnitude of these increases in primary productivity is mainly due to our limited quantitative understanding of key biogeochemical processes. To reduce uncertainty regarding the effect of whales on Southern Ocean primary productivity, future research will need to refine our understanding of five influential model parameters: iron content in krill; krill consumption rates by whales; persistence of whale faecal iron in the photic zone; bioavailability of this retained iron; and the carbon-to-iron ratio of phytoplankton.

The freeze concentration method was tested to determine if it could be used to recover water-soluble proteins while leaving the fluoride in solution. After freezing and thawing the wash water, protein and fluoride contents of the thawed fractions were determined to explore the melting regularity of components in the wash water. The highest concentration factors of protein and fluoride were obtained after 80 min of thawing, such as 1.48 +/- 0.06 and 1.35 +/- 0.04 times, respectively. The free amino-nitrogen (FAN) content and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis pattern results revealed that the highest concentrations of all ingredients were obtained after 80 min of the process. The degree of hydrolysis of all fractions from the thawing process fluctuated in a narrow range around 12% during the entire process, indicating that the thawing order did not change with various proteins or time during the entire thawing course. These results demonstrate that the freeze concentration method can be used to concentrate protein solutions, even those with fluoride. It was concluded that condensation was achieved and no ingredient could be separated, regardless of fluoride, amino acids, or different proteins in the water.																	1672-5182	1993-5021				DEC	2017	16	6					1109	1114		10.1007/s11802-017-3288-6							WOS:000414791700020

The TS which is used to convert acoustic backscatter to krill density was also presented. Body shape data were obtained from 456 specimens (54 juveniles, 200 males, and 202 females) collected off Adelie Land using a Rectangular Midwater Trawl. The sexual dimorphism manifested as a swollen cephalothorax in female krill with body lengths exceeding 40 mm. The TS of female krill was higher than those of male krill at low frequencies, even when body lengths were the same. This is because of the Rayleigh scattering region and the transition region to the geometric scattering region. The influence of the sexual dimorphism on the TS was small at frequencies exceeding 70 kHz, which are close to the geometric scattering region. The regression curve derived from the predicted TS of 456 specimens was in reasonable agreement with the measured TS in other previous studies, and the regression curve could be applied to the acoustic surveys of Antarctic krill.

Estimating the density of Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) from multi-beam echo-sounder observations using distance sampling methods	JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES C-APPLIED STATISTICS												Antarctic krill is a key species in the Antarctic food web, an important prey item for marine predators and a commercial fishery resource. Although single-beam echo-sounders are commonly used to survey the species, multi-beam echo-sounders may be more efficient because they sample a larger volume of water. However, multi-beam echo-sounders may miss animals because they involve lower energy densities. We adapt distance sampling theory to deal with this and to estimate krill density and biomass from a multi-beam echo-sounder survey. The method provides a general means for estimating density and biomass from multi-beam echo-sounder data.

Maximum yield of krill protein isolate reached 28.66% by precipitation at 4.6. Krill protein isolate demonstrated its excellent nutritional values through amino acid composition and in vitro digestibility. Thermal transition of krill protein isolate was determined by differential scanning calorimetry measurement. Extrapolated values of glass transition temperature (T-g) and denaturation temperature (T-d) of krill protein isolate were 33.8 degrees C and 80.3 degrees C when the heating rate was 2 degrees C/min. Dispersions of krill protein isolate generated self-supported gels at concentrations above 100 g/L without the addition of salt or other additives. A noticeable enhancement of gel strength was induced through cooling. Gels with krill protein isolate displayed a thermo-reversible behavior under repeating heating/cooling cycles, which was primarily due to the formation and disruption of hydrogen bonds. Network strength of protein gels was strongly dependent on protein concentrations. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

BIOLOGY LETTERS												Antarctic krill embryos and larvae were experimentally exposed to 380 (control), 1000 and 2000 mu atm pCO(2) in order to assess the possible impact of ocean acidification on early development of krill. No significant effects were detected on embryonic development or larval behaviour at 1000 mu atm pCO(2); however, at 2000 mu atm pCO(2) development was disrupted before gastrulation in 90 per cent of embryos, and no larvae hatched successfully. Our model projections demonstrated that Southern Ocean sea water pCO(2) could rise up to 1400 mu atm in krill's depth range under the IPCC IS92a scenario by the year 2100 (atmospheric pCO(2) 788 mu atm). These results point out the urgent need for understanding the pCO(2)-response relationship for krill developmental and later stages, in order to predict the possible fate of this key species in the Southern Ocean.

A re-appraisal of the total biomass and annual production of Antarctic krill	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART I-OCEANOGRAPHIC RESEARCH PAPERS												Despite much research on Euphausia superba, estimates of their total biomass and production are still very uncertain. Recently, circumpolar krill databases, combined with growth models and revisions in acoustics have made it possible to refine previous estimates. Net-based databases of density and length frequency (KRILLBASE) yield a summer distributional range of similar to 19 x 10(6) km(2) and a mean total abundance of 8 x 10(14) post-larvae with biomass of 379 million tonnes (Mt). These values are based on a standardised net sampling method but they average over the period 1926-2004, during which krill abundance has fluctuated. To estimate krill biomass at the end of last century we combined the KRILLBASE map of relative krill density around Antarctica with an acoustics-derived biomass estimate of 37.3 Mt derived for the Scotia Sea area in 2000 by the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR). Thus the CCAMLR 2000 survey area contains 28% of the total stock, with total biomass of similar to 133 Mt in January-February 2000. Gross postlarval production is estimated conservatively at 342-536 Mt yr(-1), based on three independent methods. These are high values, within the upper range of recent estimates, but consistent with the concept of high energy throughput for a species of this size. The similarity between the three production estimates reflects a broad agreement between the three growth models used, plus the fact that, for a given population size, production is relatively insensitive to the size distribution of krill at the start of the growth season. These production values lie within the envelope of what can be supported from the Southern Ocean primary production system and what is required to support an estimated predator consumption of 128-470 Mt yr(-1). Given the range of recent acoustics estimates, plus the need for precautionary management of the developing krill fishery, our net-based data provide an alternative estimate of total krill biomass.

Genetics of Antarctic Krill	BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY OF ANTARCTIC KRILL	Advances in Polar Ecology											From a genetic perspective, Euphausia superba (krill) can be described as a non-model organism with a large genome and a large population size. The population genetics of krill has been studied extensively and a consensus on population structure is now emerging. Some preliminary characterization of the krill genome has been accomplished, but the genome is too large to sequence with current technologies. The major genetic resources currently available for krill are transcriptome assemblies and DNA sequences for specific regions. Genetic technologies have advanced rapidly in the past decade and a range of new genetic approaches for studying krill population genetics, physiology, gene function and ecology are now available. Several krill gene expression studies in recent years have revealed genes involved in a range of physiological processes and highlight the potential of this approach for answering a range of questions in krill biology. The rapid expansion in genetic methods available for studying non-model organisms like krill means many new questions can be addressed with these approaches. This is an exciting time for geneticists and krill biologists considering these questions.

The effect of instrumental operating conditions and slurry sampling preparation on the analytical signal was investigated. For the determination of Cu, Fe and Zn, samples were suspended in a solution containing 2 mel L-1 HNO3. In the case of Mn, 4 mel L-1 I HNO3 was necessary for the preparation of the slurry. The precision between sample replicates was better than 5%. The method was applied to the direct determination of Cu, Fe, Mn and Zn in Antarctic krill samples using aqueous reference solutions to prepare the calibration curves. The results obtained were in good agreement with those achieved by FAAS and ICP-AES after microwave-assisted wet digestion of the krill samples. The detection limits were 4.5, 1.0, 4.9 and 8.4 mu g L-1 for Cu, Zn, Mn and Fe, respectively.

Triacylglycerols (TAGs) are an important source of free fatty acids (FFAs) in Antarctic krill paste, causing an increase in FFA content in the early stage of processing, while phospholipids are intensely hydrolyzed during the mid-late stages. Lipase activities remains constant, while PLA2 and PLD activities increases during all stages of processing. The relative activities of PLA2 and PLC highly correlates with a decline in phosphatidylcholine (PC) and an increase in lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC). A high correlation is also observed between relative PLD activity and increased phosphatidic acid (PA). These results suggest that lipase, PLA2, and PLD contribute to the degradation of lipids during the processing of salt-fermented Antarctic krill paste.																	1438-7697	1438-9312				APR	2018	120	4							1700443	10.1002/ejlt.201700443							WOS:000429322700017

A Nutritional-Toxicological Assessment of Antarctic Krill Oil versus Fish Oil Dietary Supplements	NUTRIENTS												Fish oil dietary supplements and complementary medicines are pitched to play a role of increasing strategic importance in meeting daily requirements of essential nutrients, such as long-chain (C-20, LC) omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids and vitamin D. Recently a new product category, derived from Antarctic krill, has been launched on the omega-3 nutriceutical market. Antarctic krill oil is marketed as demonstrating a greater ease of absorption due to higher phospholipid content, as being sourced through sustainable fisheries and being free of toxins and pollutants; however, limited data is available on the latter component. Persistent Organic Pollutants (POP) encompass a range of toxic, man-made contaminants that accumulate preferentially in marine ecosystems and in the lipid reserves of organisms. Extraction and concentration of fish oils therefore represents an inherent nutritional-toxicological conflict. This study aimed to provide the first quantitative comparison of the nutritional (EPA and DHA) versus the toxicological profiles of Antarctic krill oil products, relative to various fish oil categories available on the Australian market. Krill oil products were found to adhere closely to EPA and DHA manufacturer specifications and overall were ranked as containing intermediate levels of POP contaminants when compared to the other products analysed. Monitoring of the pollutant content of fish and krill oil products will become increasingly important with expanding regulatory specifications for chemical thresholds.

Circumpolar connections between Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba Dana) populations: Investigating the roles of ocean and sea ice transport	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART I-OCEANOGRAPHIC RESEARCH PAPERS												Antarctic krill, Euphausia superba Dana, has a heterogeneous circumpolar distribution in the Southern Ocean. Krill have a close association with sea ice which provides access to a critical food source and shelter, particularly in the early life stages. Advective modelling of transport pathways of krill have until now been on regional scales and have not taken explicit account of sea ice. Here we present Lagrangian modelling studies at the circumpolar scale that include interaction with sea ice. The advection scheme uses ocean velocity output from the Ocean Circulation and Climate Advanced Modelling (OCCAM) project model together with satellite-derived sea ice motion vectors to examine the potential roles of the ocean and sea ice in maintaining the observed circumpolar krill distribution. We show that the Antarctic Coastal Current is likely to be important in generating the large-scale distribution and that sea ice motion can substantially modify the ocean transport pathways, enhancing retention or dispersal depending upon location. Within the major krill region of the Scotia Sea, the effect of temporal variability in both the ocean and sea ice velocity fields is examined. Variability in sea ice motion increases variability of influx to South Georgia, at times concentrating the influx into pulses of arrival. This variability has implications for the ecosystem around the island. The inclusion of sea ice motion leads to the identification of source regions for the South Georgia krill populations additional to those identified when only ocean motion is considered. This study indicates that the circumpolar oceanic circulation and interaction with sea ice is important in determining the large-scale distribution of krill and its associated variability.

Variations in the biomass of Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) around the South Shetland Islands, 1996-2006	ICES JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE												The time-series of acoustically surveyed Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) biomass near the South Shetland Islands (SSI) between 1996 and 2006 is re-estimated using a validated physics-based model of target strength (TS), and a species-discrimination algorithm based on the length-range of krill in plankton samples to identify krill acoustically, derived from TS-model predictions. The SSI area is surveyed each austral summer by the US Antarctic Marine Living Resources Program, and the acoustic data are used to examine trends in krill biomass and to assess the potential impact of fishing to the reproductive success of land-based predators (seals and penguins). The time-series of recomputed biomass densities varies greatly from that computed using an empirical log-linear TS-model and fixed-ranges of differences in volume-backscattering strengths (Delta S-v), conventionally used to identify krill acoustically. The new acoustic estimates of biomass are significantly correlated with both proportional recruitment and krill abundance estimated from zooplankton samples. Two distinct peaks in biomass (1996 and 2003) are in accord with recruitment events shown by net-based krill time-series. The foundation for the new TS-model and the associated krill-discrimination algorithm, coupled with the agreement between acoustic- and net-survey results, provides strong support for the use of the new analytical technique. Variable biases in the re-estimated krill biomass have been greatly reduced. However, survey variability increased as a result of the increased rejection of acoustic backscatter previously attributed to krill. Management of Southern Ocean krill stocks based on a precautionary approach may therefore result in decreased allocations of krill, given its dependence on the variability of survey estimates.																	1054-3139					MAY	2008	65	4					497	508		10.1093/icesjms/fsn033							WOS:000255816900001

The future resilience of krill to climate change depends critically on the winter survival of young krill. To survive periods of extremely low production by pelagic algae during winter, krill are assumed to rely partly on carbon produced by ice algae. The true dependency on ice algae-produced carbon, however, is so far unquantified. This confounds predictions on the future resilience of krill stocks to sea ice decline. Fatty acid (FA) analysis, bulk stable isotope analysis (BSIA), and compound-specific stable isotope analysis (CSIA) of diatom- and dinoflagellate-associated marker FAs were applied to quantify the dependency of overwintering larval, juvenile, and adult krill on ice algae-produced carbon (alpha(ice)) during winter 2013 in the Weddell-Scotia Confluence Zone. Our results demonstrate that the majority of the carbon uptake of the overwintering larval and juvenile krill originated from ice algae (up to 88% of the carbon budget), and that the dependency on ice algal carbon decreased with ontogeny, reaching 56% of the carbon budget in adults. Spatio-temporal variability in the utilization of ice algal carbon was more pronounced in larvae and juvenile krill than in adults. Differences between uice estimates derived from short- vs. long-term FA-specific isotopic compositions suggested that ice algae-produced carbon gained importance as the winter progressed, and might become critical at the late winter-spring transition, before the phytoplankton bloom commences. Where the sea ice season shortens, reduced availability of ice algae might possibly not be compensated by surplus phytoplankton production during wintertime. Hence, sea ice decline could seriously endanger the winter survival of recruits, and subsequently overall biomass of krill.

During the Last Glaciation Maximum, at ca. 18 ka BP, both the Weddell and the Ross Gyres as well as near-coastal circulations probably lost their importance in the maintenance of Antarctic krill populations due to cooling of the water column and development of multi-year sea ice. Within the ACC at that time, some smaller-scale circulations related to islands and seamounts could have played a major role in controlling krill distribution. If, nevertheless, refugia for self-maintained krill populations remained in the near-coastal zone, particularly in the eastern Indian sector, geographical isolation might have caused divergence between the two species of the gregarine Cephaloidophora commonly infesting krill at present.																	0173-9565						1996	17	1-3					519	541		10.1111/j.1439-0485.1996.tb00525.x							WOS:A1996VL82400041

The Importance of Krill Predation in the Southern Ocean	BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY OF ANTARCTIC KRILL	Advances in Polar Ecology											Antarctic krill is a major prey species for a diverse array of Southern Ocean predators. The amount of krill that predators consume, and how this changes over space and time, is a key issue in understanding both regional and circumpolar aspects of the Southern Ocean food-web. We assess current knowledge of consumption by the various predator groups, and the ecological processes through which krill and its predators influence each other. Knowledge has improved greatly over recent decades and has revealed a high level of complexity in the processes that govern krill consumption. We focus on the Antarctic Peninsula and Scotia Sea region where both krill and its consumers occur in significant concentrations and where an updated estimate of krill consumption by the main vertebrate groups is 55 million tonnes per year. Research has mainly focused on mammalian and avian predators of post-larval krill, particularly penguins. Potentially important consumer groups like fish, cephalopods and carnivorous zooplankton remain poorly understood, as does consumption of the early life stages of krill. As a consequence of these knowledge gaps and the variability that arises from complexity, a reliable seasonally, spatially or taxonomically resolved description of krill consumption remains elusive. One of the key motivations for attempting to estimate krill consumption is to understand how changes in krill availability impact predator populations. Such understanding is an important requirement for ecosystem based management of the Antarctic krill fishery. We therefore propose that integrated study areas in strategic fishing locations should be developed to directly assess the response of krill predators to changes in krill availability.

Krill biomass and aggregation structure in relation to tidal cycle in a penguin foraging region off the Western Antarctic Peninsula	ICES JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE												Antarctic krill are a key component of the diet of Adlie penguins inhabiting the Western Antarctic Peninsula (WAP), yet our understanding of the variability of krill distribution patterns within nearshore penguin feeding grounds is limited. A recent study of the foraging patterns of penguins breeding in the northern WAP suggests that tidal phase plays a role in foraging distance. We used acoustics to examine biomass and aggregation structure of krill in the penguin foraging grounds off Palmer Station during diurnal and semi-diurnal tides. Nearshore, integrated krill biomass during diurnal tides was significantly higher than during semi-diurnal tides. Krill aggregations were also shallower, closer together, and larger in dimension during diurnal tides. Conversely, krill aggregations had higher volumetric biomass and abundance during semi-diurnal tides. Further offshore, at the head of the Palmer Deep canyon, krill aggregations were similar to those observed nearshore during diurnal tides (i.e. shallow, close together, and large in dimension). Since krill aggregation structure strongly influences availability as a potential prey source, we suggest that foraging behavior of Adlie penguins in this region is strongly linked to the variability in nearshore krill aggregation structure as well as biomass.

The krill sampled consisted mainly of furcilia 6 and post-larvae which did not belong to the 0+ group originating in this (1991-92) year, but presumably hatched in the summer season of 1990-91 and developed very slowly so that at the end of the following summer season, larval stages were still present in the population. No increase of the mean krill size was observed during 2.5 months of observation. The role of larval advection for the maintenance of krill population in the Weddell Sea is discussed.																	0954-1020					DEC	1996	8	4					323	329		10.1017/S0954102096000491							WOS:A1996VY20500003						
J	FEDOTOV, AS				FEDOTOV, AS			EUPHAUSIID LARVAE IN THE EASTERN PART OF THE ANTARCTIC CIRCUMPOLAR CURRENT-WEDDELL SEA CONFLUENCE ZONE IN THE AUSTRAL WINTER	OKEANOLOGIYA												According to data of the complex oceanographical survey in the east Atlantic waters of the South Ocean in June 1982, distribution, abundance and age composition of euphausiid larvae have been described in different modifications of the Antarctic waters. Larvae of Euphausia triacantha and E. frigida were caught only in the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) waters, larvae of E. superba and Thysanoessa macrura encountered both in the ACC and the Weddell Sea waters. Larvae of E. frigida and S. superba were most abundant in gyre structures within the current fields of secondary frontal zone. There were observed a delay in euphausiid spawning season in the ACC waters (E. frigida and E. superba), as well as in the Weddell Sea waters (E. superba). The spawning season of E. superba in the Weddell Sea waters was short, while in the ACC waters it lasted longer. It has been assumed that the oceanic spawning of E. superba which takes place in the eastern part of ACC-Weddell Confluence Zone is important for the reproduction and the recruitment of krill stock in the Atlantic sector of the Antarctic.																	0030-1574					MAR-APR	1992	32	2					285	292									WOS:A1992HT43300014

MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												Using stomach lavage samples from macaroni penguins Eudyptes chrysolophus Brandt breeding at Bird island, South Georgia and concurrent net samples caught within the penguin foraging range, we examined the potential selection of different length and maturity stages of Antarctic krill Euphausia superba Dana. Using Monte Carlo randomised simulation techniques, we also determined the probability of obtaining length-frequency distributions of krill different from that obtained in the net samples. The krill taken by the macaroni penguins differed significantly from those caught in the nets. Small krill (28 to 38 mm) were absent from the stomach samples, whereas large krill (58 to 62 mm) were more abundant. Random sampling using Monte Carlo simulation techniques produced length-frequency distributions that were statistically different from the original distribution of krill caught in nets on 76 out of 100 trials. Nevertheless, these differences were smaller than those found between the penguin samples and net samples. Comparison of krill maturity stages showed that krill taken by macaroni penguins contained 3 times as many female as male krill, whereas krill caught in nets contained nearly equal proportions. The differences in size and maturity of krill taken by penguins are discussed in terms of aggregated random sampling, prey selection by predators, and evasion by krill of predators and nets. We conclude that the differences are unlikely to be accounted for simply by sampling anomalies; the differences are more Likely to relate to penguins selecting larger, nutritionally superior krill, but might also reflect differential escape responses of particular classes of krill when evading penguins or nets.																	0171-8630					SEP	1996	140	1-3					1	11		10.3354/meps140001							WOS:A1996VJ37700001						
J	Clarke, A; Tyler, PA				Clarke, Andrew; Tyler, Paul A.			Adult Antarctic krill feeding at abyssal depths	CURRENT BIOLOGY												Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) is a large euphausiid, widely distributed within the Southern Ocean [1], and a key species in the Antarctic food web [2]. The Discovery Investigations in the early 20(th) century, coupled with subsequent work with both nets and echosounders, indicated that the bulk of the population of postlarval krill is typically confined to the top 150 m of the water column [1, 3, 4]. Here, we report for the first time the existence of significant numbers of Antarctic krill feeding actively at abyssal depths in the Southern Ocean. Biological observations from the deep-water remotely operated vehicle Isis in the austral summer of 2006/07 have revealed the presence of adult krill (Euphausia superba Dana), including gravid females, at unprecedented depths in Marguerite Bay, western Antarctic Peninsula. Adult krill were found close to the seabed at all depths but were absent from fjords close inshore. At all locations where krill were detected they were seen to be actively feeding, and at many locations there were exuviae (cast molts). These observations revise significantly our understanding of the depth distribution and ecology of Antarctic krill, a central organism in the Southern Ocean ecosystem.																	0960-9822	1879-0445				FEB 26	2008	18	4					282	285		10.1016/j.cub.2008.01.059							WOS:000253470300028	18302926					
J	Kawaguchi, S; Nicol, S				Kawaguchi, So; Nicol, Stephen			Learning about Antarctic krill from the fishery	ANTARCTIC SCIENCE					9th Scar International Biology Symposium	JUL 25-29, 2005	Curitiba, BRAZIL					Antarctic krill has been studied for many decades, but we are still long way from understanding their biology to be able to make reliable predictions about the reaction of their populations to environmental change. This is partly due to certain difficulties in relation to logistics, operations and survey design associated with scientific surveys that have been obstacles for us to better understand krill biology. The krill fishery is the largest fishery in the Southern Ocean, continuously operating since early 1970s. Recent studies revealed its potential to be used as a unique source for scientific discussions to understand krill biology. In this paper, after a brief overview of krill fishery operation and krill biology, we examine how current data collection through the fishery operation could contribute to a greater understanding of krill biology, and then suggest future priorities for fisheries-related research in relation to recent changes in the Southern Ocean environment.

Bengtson			Behavioural sensitivity of a key Southern Ocean species (Antarctic krill, Euphausia superba) to p,p '-DDE exposure	ECOTOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY												Persistent organic pollutants (POPs) have been frequently measured throughout the Southern Ocean food web for which little information is available to assess the potential risks of POP exposure. The current study evaluated the toxicological sensitivity of a key Southern Ocean species, Antarctic krill, to aqueous exposure of p,p'-dichlorodiphenyl dichloroethylene (p,p'-DDE). Behavioural endpoints were used as indicators of sublethal toxicity. Immediate behavioural responses (partial immobility and tail flicking) most likely reflect neurotoxicity, while the p,p'-DDE body residue causing a median level of sublethal toxicity in Antarctic krill following 96 h exposure (IEC50(sublethal) (toxicity) = 3.9 +/- 0.21 mmol/kg lipid weight) is comparable to those known to cause sublethal narcosis in temperate aquatic species. Critical body residues (CBRs) were more reproducible across tests than effective seawater concentrations. These findings support the concept of the CBR approach, that effective tissue residues are comparable across species and geographical ranges despite differences in environmental factors.

J	Nevitt, G				Nevitt, G			Olfactory foraging in Antarctic seabirds: a species-specific attraction to krill odors	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												Antarctic procellariiform seabirds are known for their well-developed sense of smell, yet few behavioral experiments have addressed how these birds use olfactory cues to forage at sea. I describe results from controlled, shipboard experiments performed in Antarctic waters near Elephant Island. Birds were presented with plain or krill-scented (Euphausia superba) vegetable oil slicks, and their behavioral responses were compared. Krill-scented vegetable oil slicks were highly attractive to some but not all procellariiform species foraging in this area (p < 0.001, G-test). Cape petrels Daption capense and southern giant petrels Macronectes giganteus appeared at krill-scented slicks within 1 min, whereas black-browed albatrosses Diomedea melanophris appeared within 3 min. Cape petrels D, capense showed the strongest attraction: these birds were observed as much as 5 times as frequently at krill-scented slicks as compared to unscented control slicks (p < 0.001, G-test), while storm-petrels (Oceanites oceanicus and Fregetta tropica) and Antarctic Fulmars Fulmarus glacialoides responded in equal numbers to krill-scented and unscented slicks. When considered with respect to previously published findings, these results suggest a greater complexity in the significance of odors to the foraging ecology of different tube-nosed species than has commonly been assumed.																	0171-8630	1616-1599					1999	177						235	241		10.3354/meps177235							WOS:000079215300021

The risk to fishery performance associated with spatially resolved management of Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) harvesting	ICES JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE												The ecosystem approach to fisheries attempts to define objectives for target species, the wider ecosystem, and critically, the fishery itself. Proposals for implementing the approach often include spatial restrictions on harvesting, so it is important to understand how these will affect fishery performance. One metric of potential performance is the probability of encountering exploitable densities of a target species at the scale of fishing operations. The probability of encountering exploitable densities of Antarctic krill, Euphausia superba, at the scale of 1 nautical mile during an acoustic survey was predicted by bathymetry and the mean krill density at the larger scale at which the fishery is managed. This suggests that the risk to fishery performance will increase if management actions relocate the fishery into deeper water. The results also suggest that ecosystem models resolved to the spatial scale of management units could usefully predict effects at the scale of fishing operations. However, correct parameterization of these models will require better characterization of threshold densities for efficient exploitation. Finally, the distribution of catch and fishing effort over an entire fishing season reflected the distribution of krill density observed during the survey.

J	Lin, N; Liu, BL; Liu, ZD; Qi, T				Lin, Na; Liu, Baolin; Liu, Zhidong; Qi, Ting			Effects of different drying methods on the structures and functional properties of phosphorylated Antarctic krill protein	JOURNAL OF FOOD SCIENCE												Antarctic krill protein (AKP) was extracted from Antarctic krill by an alkali dissolution-isoelectric precipitation method and then it was phosphorylated with sodium tripolyphosphate. The phosphorylated Antarctic krill protein (P-AKP) powder was obtained by spray-drying (SD), freeze-drying (FD), and hot-air drying (AD), and the effects of these drying methods on the structures and functional properties of proteins were investigated. The P-AKP powder dried by SD had the best sensory performance, and its particle size was much smaller than that of FD and AD. Scanning electron microscope displayed a uniform particle size of SD powder and the particles were uniformly dispersed. X-ray diffraction analysis showed a higher crystallinity of SD sample than AD and FD. Differential scanning calorimeter analysis revealed that SD sample had the best thermal stability and less protein denaturation (Delta H= 210.80 J/g), followed by FD (Delta H= 80.48 J/g) and AD (Delta H= 73.94 J/g;P< 0.05). Fourier transform infrared showed that SD sample contained more protein secondary structure. Compared with SD, the phosphorylated group-related chemical bonds in FD and AD samples were partially destroyed. SD sample had the highest protein solubility, oil absorption capacity, emulsifying, and foaming activities than FD and AD (P< 0.05). Although FD had the highest water absorption capacity, sample prepared with AD had the worst functional performance. Therefore, different drying methods used for preparation of the P-AKP can affect its physicochemical and associated functional properties, and SD could be an appropriate drying method for the industrial mass production of P-AKP powders with better functionalities. Practical Application The optimal drying method for preparing the phosphorylated Antarctic krill protein (P-AKP) powder was proved to be spray-drying (SD), because the physicochemical and functional properties were better for P-AKP dried by SD than the other drying methods. Hence, SD was recommended for the industrial mass production of P-AKP powders with better functionalities. This research can provide theoretical guidance for the further processing and utilization of P-AKP, and offer technical reference for food processing and preservation.																	0022-1147	1750-3841				NOV	2020	85	11					3690	3699		10.1111/1750-3841.15503		OCT 2020					WOS:000578949400001	33073379

The characteristics of krill swarms in relation to aggregating Antarctic blue whales	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS												We model the presence of rare Antarctic blue whales (Balaenoptera musculus intermedia) in relation to the swarm characteristics of their main prey species, Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba). A combination of visual observations and recent advances in passive acoustic technology were used to locate Antarctic blue whales, whilst simultaneously using active underwater acoustics to characterise the distribution, size, depth, composition and density of krill swarms. Krill swarm characteristics and blue whale presence were examined at a range of spatiotemporal scales to investigate sub meso-scale (i.e., <100 km) foraging behaviour. Results suggest that at all scales, Antarctic blue whales are more likely to be detected within the vicinity of krill swarms with a higher density of krill, those found shallower in the water column, and those of greater vertical height. These findings support hypotheses that as lunge-feeders of extreme size, Antarctic blue whales target shallow, dense krill swarms to maximise their energy intake. As both Antarctic krill and blue whales play a key role in the Southern Ocean ecosystem, the nature of their predator-prey dynamics is an important consideration, not only for the recovery of this endangered species in a changing environment, but for the future management of Antarctic krill fisheries.

J	Reid, K; Croxall, JP; Briggs, DR; Murphy, EJ				Reid, K; Croxall, JP; Briggs, DR; Murphy, EJ			Antarctic ecosystem monitoring: quantifying the response of ecosystem indicators to variability in Antarctic krill.	ICES JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE					Symposium on Quantitative Ecosystem Indicators for Fisheries Management	MAR 31-APR 03, 2004	UNESCO, Intergovernmental Oceanog Commiss, Paris, FRANCE	Sci Comm Ocean Res	UNESCO, Intergovernmental Oceanog Commiss			The utility of upper-trophic-level species as ecosystem indicators is determined by our ability to relate changes in indices of their performance to changes at lower trophic levels. Such relationships were assessed using indices of predator performance (response vectors) for four predator species, together with independent ship-based acoustic estimates of abundance of their main prey, Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba), from South Georgia in the South Atlantic Ocean. Out of 32 response vectors investigated, 13 showed a significant non-linear relationship, based on a Holling Type II response, to krill abundance, and just five showed a significant linear relationship. Predator responses reflecting the processes during summer, when prey surveys were undertaken, showed the closest relationship with prey abundance. Distinct relationships existed between the variability of indices and the biological processes they measured. Body mass variables had the lowest variability (CVs < 10%), whereas those measuring breeding success showed the greatest variability (CVs > 50%). Multivariate indices, produced by combining response vectors from all four predator species into a single combined index, provided a better fit with krill data than any of the individual vectors. Whereas population size parameters for individual species showed no relationship with annual estimates of krill abundance, a combined, multispecies population size index did show a significant response. Understanding the form of the relationship between concurrent indicators of prey abundance and key ecosystem metrics/reference points, such as population size, is crucial to the application of monitoring data to management action.

Results showed that AKP significantly increased bone mineral density, improved bone biomechanical properties, and ameliorated trabecular bone microstructure by promoting bone anabolism in SAMP6. Neonatal murine calvaria culture system further demonstrated that AKP stimulated osteoblast-induced new osteoid and bone formation ex vivo. The mechanism revealed that AKP induced the secretion and expression of bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP2), which was identified as a potent osteoinductive factor, and activated BMP2-dependent Smads signaling by phosphorylation of Smad1. Wnt signaling shares the same osteogenesis related transcriptional factor Runx2 with BMP2/Smads pathway. AKP also induced the activation of Wnt/-catenin signaling by upregulating the expression of Wnt10b and -catenin. In conclusion, AKP ameliorated senile osteoporosis by activating BMP2/Smads and Wnt/-catenin molecular pathways, thereby promoting bone formation. Practical applicationsAs a novel food material, Antarctic krill possesses an enormous biomass and utilization potential. It contains the largest amount of protein among all recorded organisms worldwide and the protein biological value is better than other animal proteins. This study demonstrated that peptides hydrolyzed from Antarctic Krill exhibit antiosteoporotic activity, which may provide some theoretical basis for the high-value of Antarctic Krill protein as antiosteoporotic functional foods in future.				yuntao, liu/AAO-6411-2020	yuntao, liu/0000-0002-8320-8725												0145-8884	1745-4514				AUG	2017	41	4							e12381	10.1111/jfbc.12381							WOS:000407085800010

Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) exhibit positive phototaxis to white LED light	POLAR BIOLOGY												The use of light-emitting diodes (LEDs) is increasingly used in fishing gears and its application is known to trigger negative or positive phototaxis (i.e., swimming away or toward the light source, respectively) for some marine species. However, our understanding of how artificial light influences behavior is poorly understood for many species and most studies can be characterized as trial and error experiments. In this study, we tested whether exposure to white LED light could initiate a phototactic response in Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba). Trawl-caught krill were used in a controlled artificial light exposure experiment conducted onboard a vessel in the Southern Ocean. The experiment was conducted in chambers with dark and light zones in which krill could move freely. Results showed that krill displayed a significant positive phototaxis. Understanding this behavioral response is relevant to development of krill fishing technology to improve scientific sampling gear, improve harvest efficiency, and reduce potential unwanted bycatch.

Understanding the variability in the iron concentration of Antarctic krill	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Antarctic krill may play a significant role in the Southern Ocean iron cycle. However, understanding the control on iron budgets by Antarctic krill is hampered by the large range in the reported iron concentration of krill. The aim of this study was to investigate the causes of the large range of iron concentrations in krill reported in the literature (6-190 mg kg(-1)). Antarctic krill samples were collected from three research voyages to Pyrdz Bay, Antarctica, and analysed individually. Iron concentrations were measured using sector field inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry in whole krill specimens and in the isolated stomach, digestive gland, muscle, body (whole krill excluding stomach and digestive gland), exoskeleton and faecal pellets. Iron concentrations in stomach (6-98 mg/kg), digestive gland (14-82 mg kg(-1)), and faecal pellet (683-1039 mg kg(-1)) were higher compared to muscle (4-7 mg kg(-1)), exoskeleton (6-15 mg kg(-1)), and body (4-18 mg kg(-1)) indicating that krill may ingest more iron than they require for physiological processes. Iron concentrations in whole krill from March 2012 (10 +/- 3 mg kg(-1)) were significantly lower compared to February 2003 (19 +/- 7 mg kg(-1)) and February 2015 (18 +/- 12 mg kg(-1)). Overall, the iron concentrations in krill from this study were consistently at the lower end of the published range. We propose that the large range in reported whole iron concentrations of krill can be accounted for by a combination of seasonal and regional differences in sampling, reflecting differences in the quantity and quality of their diet.

To address the knowledge gap, we conducted a 60-day feeding trial. At the end of the experiment (day 60), the cuttlefish Sepiella japonica eating Palaemon gravieri (SJP) grew significantly faster than those eating Euphausia superba (SJE), with the specific growth rate (SGR)(SJP) (7.92%) > (SGR)(SJE) (7.09%). Approximately 33.3% and 20.0% mortality was observed in the SJE and SJP, during the course of the experiment respectively. Some important fatty acids (i.e. n-3 and n-6 PUFAs) were elevated in SJE with respect to SJP. Replacement of Antarctic krill increased the diversity of the gut microbiome composition in the SJE group. Fluoride accumulated in the ink sac and cuttlebone of cuttlefish in SJE. Overall, these findings imply that PUFA-rich Antarctic krill could replace P. gravieri shrimp for feeding cuttlefish S. japonica.																	1355-557X	1365-2109				MAY	2020	51	5					1867	1879		10.1111/are.14537		FEB 2020					WOS:000512422900001

Antarctic krill peptide powder (AKPP) prepared from the tail meat by enzymatic hydrolysis significantly decreased the systolic blood pressure in spontaneously hypertensive rats by a single oral administration (1, 10, or 100 mg). Presumably, the effect of AKPP was through inhibition of the conversion of angiotensin, which mediates blood pressure elevation, from its inactive propeptide to the mature angiotensin. Two potent angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory peptides were isolated from AKPP by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and identified as Val-Trp (IC50 = 2.75 mu g/mL; 12.9 mu M) and Leu-Lys-Tyr (IC50 = 4.26 mu g/mL; 10.1 mu M). Val-Trp and Leu-Lys-Tyr comprised 0.025% +/- 0.0023% (w/w) and 0.018% +/- 0.0023% (w/w) of AKPP, respectively, as measured by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS). The contributions of Val-Trp and Leu-Lys-Tyr to the ACE inhibitor activity of AKPP were 17.7% +/- 1.60% and 8.04% +/- 1.03%, respectively, suggesting that these 2 peptides constitute a substantial portion of the overall ACE inhibitor potential of AKPP.																	0022-1147	1750-3841				MAY	2009	74	4					H116	H120		10.1111/j.1750-3841.2009.01138.x							WOS:000265937800031	19490329					
J	Cripps, GC; Watkins, JL; Hill, HJ; Atkinson, A				Cripps, GC; Watkins, JL; Hill, HJ; Atkinson, A			Fatty acid content of Antarctic krill Euphausia superba at South Georgia related to regional populations and variations in diet	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												The fatty acid content of Antarctic krill Euphausia superba from South Georgia was investigated during January and February 1996, a period of relatively low algal biomass. Cluster analysis of the fatty acid data revealed 3 regionally distinct groups of krill. Group A consisted primarily of subadults (median length 42 mm) and was characterised by high proportions of 14:0, 16:0 and 18:1 (n-9) fatty acids. Group B comprised mainly juveniles and a small proportion of adults (median length 33 mm) and had a fatty acid profile similar to that of Group A. The largest group, Group C (8 of 14 stations, mostly to the east of the survey area), was almost exclusively juveniles plus a small number of sub-adults (median length 29 mm) and had unusually high percentages of polyunsaturated fatty acids [PUFA; 18:4(n-3), 20:5(n-3) and 22:6(n-3)]. Krill from Group C had the lowest total fatty acid concentrations (150 to 722 mg kg(-1)). These krill were surviving on the lowest algal biomass in the region and had probably resorted to carnivory on PUFA rich copepods. The pattern of fatty acids in krill from Groups A and B resembled that of krill collected from a diatom bloom in the Bellingshausen Sea, but the concentrations were generally lower. The well fed krill from the Bellingshausen Sea showed small variations in fatty acid content associated with sex and maturity, but the South Georgia results indicated that diet can have a greater impact on fatty acid content than sex and maturity stages. Fatty acid profiles were indicative of food regimes that were so distinct that the krill probably originated from spatially independent groups.																	0171-8630	1616-1599					1999	181						177	188		10.3354/meps181177							WOS:000080772700015

Modelling three-dimensional directivity of sound scattering by Antarctic krill: progress towards biomass estimation using multibeam sonar	ICES JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE					ICES Symposium on the Ecosystem Approach to Fisheries Acoutics and Complementary Technologies	JUN 16-20, 2008	Bergen, NORWAY	ICES				Target strength (TS) estimation is a principal source of uncertainty in acoustic surveys of Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba). Although TS is strongly dependent on krill orientation, there is a paucity of information in this regard. This paper considers the potential for narrow-bandwidth, multibeam-echosounder (MBE) data to be used for estimating the orientations of krill beneath survey vessels. First, software was developed to predict MBE measurements of the directivity patterns of acoustic scattering from individual or aggregated krill in any orientation. Based on the distorted-wave, Born approximation model (DWBA), scattering intensities are predicted vs. MBE angles for specified distributions of krill orientations (pitch, roll, and yaw angles) and swarm densities. Results indicate that certain distributions of orientations, perhaps indicative of particular behaviour, should be apparent from the sonar data. The model results are compared with measurements on krill made using a 200-kHz MBE deployed from a small craft off Cape Shirreff, Livingston Island, Antarctica, in summer 2006. The stochastic DWBA model is then invoked to explain disparities between the model predictions and MBE measurements.

Spatial and temporal variability in the structure of aggregations of Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) around South Georgia, 1997-1999	ICES JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE												Antarctic krill are important in the South Georgia (548 degrees S 358 degrees W) marine ecosystem. They form aggregations that vary widely in packing density (<1 to 1000 s of individuals m(-3)), length (tens to thousands of metres), and height (tens of metres). Acoustic surveys are often used to estimate krill biomass and provide data that give insight into aggregation structure. Using dual-frequency (38 and 120 kHz) acoustic data collected during six surveys conducted around South Georgia during the 1997, 1998, and 1999 austral summers, we isolated 2990 aggregations by applying the Shoal Analysis and Patch Estimation System algorithm in Echoview and a krill-length-dependent acoustic identifier (Delta Sv120-38). Multivariate cluster (partition) analysis was applied to metrics from each of the aggregations, resulting in three aggregation types with an overall proportional split of 0.28 : 0.28 : 0.44. Types 1 and 3 had low mean densities (<2 g m(-3)), whereas Type 2 had a mean density of 94 g m(-3). Intersurvey differences were found between the effort-corrected numbers of aggregation types (p 2.5e(-6)), and between on-and off-continental shelf areas (p = 1.5e(-7)), with a greater number of Type 2 aggregations being found on-shelf. The findings suggest intersurvey variation in krill catchability, with krill being more likely to be caught on-shelf.

SENSITIVITY INVESTIGATION OF THE SDWBA ANTARCTIC KRILL TARGET STRENGTH MODEL TO FATNESS, MATERIAL CONTRASTs AND ORIENTATION	CCAMLR SCIENCE												The distorted-wave Born approximation model is recognised as state-of-the-art in predicting acoustic target strength (TS) from fluid-like marine organisms. A stochastic version, the so-called SDWBA model, is endorsed by CCAMLR to predict the TS of Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) for use in the acoustic echo-integration method. In this study, the SDWBA TS pattern and frequency response behaviours at standard survey frequencies and animal lengths are explored via a sensitivity analysis of some important parameters: number of stochastic realisations, the fatness factor, the material contrasts between the organism and the surrounding seawater and the distribution of animal orientations. Due to the high variability of TS to realistic changes in parameters, it is important that the model should be parameterised according to the potential seasonal variability of krill in the area of investigation. In a multifrequency context, the girth-length relationship for the body shape parameterisation can give a high source of uncertainty, and there is an urgent need for development of accurate and standard procedures to measure both the material property contrasts and the orientation at the time and location of the actual survey. Moreover, a number of incongruities within the CCAMLR SDWBA model package are identified and proposed solutions implemented in an improved package.																	1023-4063						2011	18						97	122									WOS:000208703000007

Risk maps for Antarctic krill under projected Southern Ocean acidification	NATURE CLIMATE CHANGE												Marine ecosystems of the Southern Ocean are particularly vulnerable to ocean acidification(1). Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba; hereafter krill) is the key pelagic species of the region and its largest fishery resource(2). There is therefore concern about the combined effects of climate change, ocean acidification and an expanding fishery on krill and ultimately, their dependent predators-whales, seals and penguins(3,4). However, little is known about the sensitivity of krill to ocean acidification. Juvenile and adult krill are already exposed to variable seawater carbonate chemistry because they occupy a range of habitats and migrate both vertically and horizontally on a daily and seasonal basis(5). Moreover, krill eggs sink from the surface to hatch at 700-1,000m (ref. 6), where the carbon dioxide partial pressure (p(CO2)) in sea water is already greater than it is in the atmosphere(7). Krill eggs sink passively and so cannot avoid these conditions. Here we describe the sensitivity of krill egg hatch rates to increased CO2, and present a circumpolar risk map of krill hatching success under projected p(CO2) levels. We find that important krill habitats of the Weddell Sea and the Haakon VII Sea to the east are likely to become high-risk areas for krill recruitment within a century. Furthermore, unless CO2 emissions are mitigated, the Southern Ocean krill population could collapse by 2300 with dire consequences for the entire ecosystem.

Bengtson			Altered developmental timing in early life stages of Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) exposed to p,p '-DDE	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Persistent organic pollutants (POPS) are persistent, toxic and bioaccumulative anthropogenic organic chemicals, capable of undergoing long range environmental transport to remote areas including the Antarctic. p,p'-dichlorodiphenyl dichloroethylene (pp'-DDE) has been identified as a dominant POP accumulating in Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba), which is a key Southern Ocean species. This study examined the developmental toxicity of pp'-DDE via aqueous exposure to Antarctic krill larvae. p,p'-DDE exposure was found to stimulate developmental timing in the first three larval stages of Antarctic krill, while extended monitoring of larvae after a five day exposure period had ended, revealed delayed inhibitory responses during development to the fourth larval stage. Stimulatory responses were observed from the lowest p,p'-DDE body residue tested of 10.1 +/- 3.0 mu mol/kg (3.2 +/- 0.95 mg/kg) preserved wet weight, which is comparable to findings for temperate species and an order of magnitude lower than the exposure level found to cause sublethal behavioural effects in Antarctic krill. The delayed responses included increased mortality, which had doubled in the highest p,p'-DDE treatment (95 +/- 8.9% mortality at 20 mu g/L p,p'-DDE) compared to the solvent control (44 +/- 11% mortality) 2 weeks after end of exposure. Development of surviving metanauplius larvae to calyptopis 1 larvae was delayed by 2 days in p,p'-DDE exposed larvae compared with untreated larvae. Finally, the developmental success of surviving pp'-DDE exposed larvae was reduced by 50 to 75% compared to the solvent control (100% developmental success). The lowest observed effect concentration for all delayed effects was 1 mu g/L, the lowest exposure concentration tested. These findings demonstrate the importance of delayed and indirect effects of toxicant exposure. Further, the findings of this study are important for environmental risk assessment of POPs in the Southern Ocean ecosystem and strongly highlight the significance of developmental endpoints for ecotoxicological testing.

J	Han, XN; Liu, DC				Han, Xiangning; Liu, Daicheng			Di(2-ethylhexyl) adipate (DEHA) detection in Antarctic krill (Euphasia superba Dana)	POLAR RESEARCH												In this reported study, a novel high-performance thin-layer chromatography (HPTLC) method was developed for the detection and quantification of the toxic substance di(2-ethylhexyl) adipate (DEHA) in Antarctic krill. This procedure was based on the extraction of DEHA by ultrasonic solvent extraction with anhydrous ethanol, silica-gel column chromatographic separation, HPTLC detection and quantification using petroleum ether/ethyl acetate/acetone/glacial acetic acid (29:1:0.5:2d*, v/v/v/v) as the developing solvent and bromine thymol blue solution as the chromogenic agent. The content of DEHA in freeze-dried Antarctic krill was found to be ca. 0.63 +/- 0.05 mg/g. The structure of DEHA in the Antarctic krill was subsequently determined by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and infrared chromatography, which verified the presence of this compound in the krill. The HPTLC method exhibited excellent accuracy, with a recovery of 97.1-101.6% and good precision with a relative standard deviation of 2.47-4.90%. The DEHA in Antarctic krill oil was extracted by n-hexane and detected using the same method described above, which verified that DEHA was also present in krill oil at a concentration of ca. 2.16 +/- 0.08 mg/g. The presence of DEHA in kill oil is very concerning because of its demonstrated harmful ecotoxicity, and since Antarctic krill is the key link in the food chain in the Antarctic coastal marine ecosystem. The adverse effects of DEHA on Antarctic krill and the source of DEHA will be explored in future research.																	0800-0395	1751-8369				MAY 9	2018	37								1457395	10.1080/17518369.2018.1457395							WOS:000431798400001						
J	Haberman, KL; Ross, RM; Quetin, LB				Haberman, KL; Ross, RM; Quetin, LB			Diet of the Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba Dana): II. Selective grazing in mixed phytoplankton assemblages	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY												Diatoms, prymnesiophytes, and cryptophytes are the major taxonomic classes of phytoplankton available to Antarctic krill as primary food resources. However, the relative contribution of each class to the diet of krill is unknown. In this study, selectivity for different phytoplankton taxa by Euphausia superba was examined during laboratory experiments with E. superba grazing on mixed phytoplankton assemblages from the wild and from laboratory cultures. Clearance rates and changes in relative concentrations of diatoms, prymnesiophytes and cryptophytes were measured by analysis of taxon-specific accessory photopigments with high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). E. superba grazed diatoms at higher rates than Phaeocystis and cryptophytes. Grazing was negligible in cryptophyte-dominated assemblages, Increases of up to 369% in 19'-hexanoyloxyfucoxanthin (HF)/fucoxanthin (FUCO) (prymnesiophyte/diatom) ratios indicated a high level of selectivity for diatoms over Phaeocystis. This selectivity occurred even for Phaeocystis colonies of similar size to diatoms, and thus cannot be entirely attributed to differential sieving efficiency based on particle size. The results suggest that krill actively select diatoms in phytoplankton mixtures.

The morphology and ontogeny of E. mucronata is known from calyptopis I to the adult phase, but the embryonic and early-life stages (nauplius and metanauplius) of this broadcast spawning species are unknown. We describe the morphology and development time of these life stages to complete the knowledge of its life cycle. Embryos were obtained from purple-gonad gravid females collected off Dichato, central Chile, during November 2012. Eight gravid females (mean=16mm total length) were incubated in seawater at 12 degrees C under laboratory conditions. The average development time from single-cell embryos to the metanauplius stage was 2.2d and hatching occurred between 20 and 25h. The average growth rate was 0.35mmd(-1) from the late limb bud to the metanauplius stage (range=0.21-0.48mmd(-1)). Embryos of E. mucronata had a mean chorion diameter of 0.460mm, embryo diameter of 0.343mm, and perivitelline space of 0.056mm. Our biological information reported here constitutes a baseline for future ecological studies on distribution and temporal variability of spawning activity and reproductive strategies of E. mucronata in the highly variable and productive Humboldt Current ecosystem.

We used a new precise method using the split-beam method in a small tank for TS measurement of small-size animals. We compared the measured results with the theoretical TS patterns by the Distorted Wave Born Approximation-based deformed cylinder model (DWBA model) and confirmed a good agreement at near the main lobe, however, the measured results were higher than the model predictions in the side lobe regions. Although the discrepancy was examined from several aspects such as body bending and scattering from pleopods, any factor was not decisive. In other words, it is likely that the discrepancy is caused by some factors combined. The Stochastic version of the DWBA model showed a reasonable agreement with the measured TS in the side lobe regions. This phenomenon should be examined further from physical view points.																			0-7803-8541-1				2004							161	168		10.1109/UT.2004.1405515							WOS:000227356400023

Feeding by Antarctic krill Euphausia superba in the West Antarctic Peninsula: differences between fjords and open waters	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												Antarctic krill Euphausia superba are key components of Antarctic ecosystems, serving as the major prey item for most of the megafauna in the region. Coastal fjords along the West Antarctic Peninsula have been identified as biological hotspots, areas in which high biomasses of both E. superba and their megafauna predators are consistently observed. We investigated feeding by E. superba in fjords and adjacent open waters of the West Antarctic Peninsula. Next generation sequencing of stomach contents from 174 krill indicated a diverse diet, with broad patterns consistent with previous understanding of E. superba feeding. Diatom sequence reads were frequent and abundant, indicating a largely diatom-based diet, while the occasional presence of high abundances of copepod sequence reads suggests carnivory supplemented the diet. Striking differences were observed between the stomach contents of krill collected in fjords and those of krill collected in adjacent open waters. Chaetoceros spp. diatoms made up 71 % of the stomach contents sequences of krill collected in fjords, but less than 10% of the stomach contents sequences of krill collected in open waters. These differences could not be explained by differences in the surface water phytoplankton communities, as in both open waters and fjords Chaetoceros spp. made up less than 10% of the surface water sequence read assemblages. These feeding differences highlight the importance of taking into account regional differences in krill feeding when considering E. superba's roles in Southern Ocean ecosystems, and suggest krill in fjords may make use of vertical structure in phytoplankton assemblages.																	0171-8630	1616-1599				MAY 14	2018	595						39	54		10.3354/meps12568							WOS:000432551900004

We generated a virtual ecosystem, using a spatial automaton-geographic information system technique, to study management scenarios. We used literature data to generate the advection field, the initial krill biomass, and the distribution and size of penguin colonies in the area. Parameters for the fishing fleet were extracted from analysis of Chilean krill-fishing vessels. The model assumes that krill are passive current drifters and that penguin foraging occurs in areas close to their colonies. We analyzed the effect that a simulated 20-vessel fishing fleet would have on the availability of prey, considering the krill flux due to advection. The results show that it would be reasonable to manage the krill fishery in the South Shetland Islands as an interconnected set of ecotrophic modules, allocating the fleet downstream from the main penguin foraging sector.

Sensitivity analysis identifies high influence sites for estimates of penguin krill consumption on the Antarctic Peninsula	ANTARCTIC SCIENCE												Krill consumption by natural predators represents a critical link between surveys and models of standing krill biomass and the design of a sustainable krill fishery for the Scotia Sea. Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) is a significant component of diet for penguins breeding in this region and, consequently, uncertainties regarding penguin population abundances contribute to uncertainties in krill predation estimates. We use a comprehensive database of Antarctic penguin abundances to identify 14 breeding colonies that contribute most significantly to uncertainty regarding the total number of pygoscelid penguins breeding in this region. We find that a high quality survey of Zavodovski Island alone would decrease uncertainty in total population by 24.8%, whereas high quality surveys of all 14 "high-influence" locations would decrease uncertainty by almost 72%. Updated population estimates at these sites should be considered top priority for future fieldwork in the region. Our results are based on a robust quantitative method for assessing data priorities in estimating krill consumption that is easily extended to other groups of krill predators.																	0954-1020	1365-2079				FEB	2013	25	1					19	23		10.1017/S0954102012000600							WOS:000314147700004

This study presents a detailed optimization of the analysis of volatile flavor compounds from Antarctic krill by combining headspace solid-phase microextraction (HS-SPME) as the extracting method and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC-MS) as the analysis. An optimal solid-phase microextraction (SPME) fiber was selected, and the microextraction conditions were optimized using the response surface method (RSM). The Divinylbenzene/Carboxen/Polydimethylsiloxane (DVB/CAR/PDMS) fiber showed the highest extraction efficiency and was selected for further optimization of extraction temperature, extraction time, and sodium chloride concentration. Forty-two types of volatile substances producing characteristic flavors were detected, seven of which contributed significantly to the flavor of Antarctic krill. Ethers, pyrazine, and aldehyde compounds contribute to the main flavor of Antarctic krill. The compounds 2-ethyl-3, 5-dimethyl-pyrazine, 2, 3, 5-trimethyl-6-ethyl-pyrazine, and 3-ethyl-2, 5-dimethyl- pyrazine produce the roasted flavor and the characteristic nutty odor. Moreover (E, Z)-2, 6-nonadienal adds a cucumber fragrance. The compounds 3-methyl-butanal and 3-methional play an important role in determining the overall flavor.																	1094-2912	1532-2386					2017	20			1			S820	S829		10.1080/10942912.2017.1315589							WOS:000423507200071

Intra-annual variability in the density of Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) at south Georgia, 2002-2005: Within-year variation provides a new framework for interpreting previous 'annual' estimates of krill density	CCAMLR SCIENCE												Upward-looking acoustic Doppler current profilers (300 kHz) and echo sounders (125 kHz) were deployed on moorings on- and off-shelf to the northwest of South Georgia between 14 October 2002 and 29 December 2005 to measure density of Antarctic krill and environmental parameters continuously. A distinct seasonal pattern in krill density, recurring consistently over all three years, was detected. Krill densities in winter were predominantly low (mean = 18.7 g m(-2), SD = 24.3), but had risen substantially by summer in each year (mean = 89.5 g m(-2), SD = 64.2). A sinusoidal regression model (period = 52 weeks) with time as the independent variable explained 64% of the observed week-to-week variation. Estimates of krill density from moored instruments were not statistically different (P > 0.05) from estimates derived from standard ship-based krill surveys in adjacent time periods, suggesting that the point estimates from moored instruments were representative of krill density in a wider spatial context (ship surveys cover c. 100 x 100 km). Data from moored instruments were used to explore whether high-frequency temporal variation (i.e. within-year) could have led to the perceived between-year variation in krill density arising from previous summer surveys in the South Georgia western core box region between 1990 and 2005. Comparison of these 'snap-shot' ship survey estimates with the observed pattern of within-year variability showed that some of the apparent 'year-to-year' variation could simply be attributed to sampling on different dates of the year (e.g. November cf. February). However, there were some survey estimates that were significantly different (P < 0.01) from the regression-predicted within-year variation. Years that stand out for markedly low krill density (i.e. densities below the range expected due to intra-annual variation) were 1993/94, 1998/99 and 1999/2000. Moored instruments provide valuable data that could be important for ecosystem-based management at South Georgia because, for example, they will enable predator-prey functional responses to be explored there for the first time at appropriate temporal scales, and will enable hypotheses relating variation in krill abundance to physical oceanographic variability to be tested.

Comparing distribution and prey selection of fishing operations versus predators is needed to predict fishery-related impacts on krill-dependent predators. In this context, it is important to consider not only predators breeding near the fishing grounds but also the ones breeding far away and that disperse during the non-breeding season where they may interact with fisheries. In this study, we first quantified the overlap between the distribution of the Antarctic krill fisheries and the distribution of a krill dependent seabird, the Antarctic petrel Thalassoica antarctica, during both the breeding and non-breeding season. We tracked birds from the world biggest Antarctic petrel colony (Svarthamaren, Dronning Maud Land), located >1000 km from the main fishing areas, during three consecutive seasons. The overall spatial overlap between krill fisheries and Antarctic petrels was limited but varied greatly among and within years, and was high in some periods during the non-breeding season. In a second step, we described the length frequency distribution of Antarctic krill consumed by Antarctic petrels, and compared this with results from fisheries, as well as from diet studies in other krill predators. Krill taken by Antarctic petrels did not differ in size from that taken by trawls or from krill taken by most Antarctic krill predators. Selectivity for specific Antarctic krill stages seems generally low in Antarctic predators. Overall, our results show that competition between Antarctic petrels and krill fisheries is currently likely negligible. However, if krill fisheries are to increase in the future, competition with the Antarctic petrel may occur, even with birds breeding thousands of kilometers away.

J	Nicol, S				Nicol, S			Krill, currents, and sea ice: Euphausia superba and its changing environment	BIOSCIENCE												Investigations of Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) over the last 40 years have examined almost every aspect of the biology of these ecologically important animals. Various elements of krill biology have been brought together to provide concepts of how, this species interacts with its environment, but there have been few recent attempts to generate a generalized conceptual model of its life history In this article I present such a model, based art previous descriptions, observations, and recent data from the scientific literature. This model takes into account a range of findings on krill biology and on the relationships between Antarctic krill and its biotic and abiotic environment. Krill life history is thus viewed as all evolved product of interactions between the species and its environment. The model places particular emphasis oil the different forces that act on the larval and adult stages, and on the interaction between krill behavior, systems of ocean currents, and sea ice.																	0006-3568	1525-3244				FEB	2006	56	2					111	120		10.1641/0006-3568(2006)056[0111:KCASIE]2.0.CO;2							WOS:000235422800012

Notably, krill oil (KO) is rich in phospholipids (PLs), polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), and astaxanthin. A method based on a green switchable hydrophilicity solvent N,N-dimethylcyclohexylamine (DMCHA), which can reversibly change from oil soluble to water soluble in the presence of CO2 was used to extract KO from frozen Antarctic krill as it consumes less energy than traditional methods. We showed that DMCHA destroyed the surface structure of Antarctic krill and accelerated the dissolution of KO. In addition, this method enabled the PL extraction to reach up to 80.2% of total PLs, among which PC accounted for the highest proportion, up to 90.91% in PL. In fact, the astaxanthin extraction reached up to 81.44% of total astaxanthin while the fatty acid (FA) extraction up to 84.35%. The KO extracted through DMCHA was rich in PUFA, up to 47.74%, and the content of EPA + DHA reached 42.16% of total FA content. Furthermore, the amount of residual solvent in the lipid phase was just 0.23% of the DMCHA used for the extraction and the recovery rate of solvent was up to 93.2%. Our results demonstrated the high efficiency of oil extraction and the environmental friendliness of this method.																	2096-6490	2662-1746				FEB	2020	2	1					41	49		10.1007/s42995-019-00019-w							WOS:000649453200006

AKP, extracted from Antarctic krill, was activated by maleic anhydride and then reacted with PAN in water to prepare PAN-graft-AKP (PAN-g-AKP). PAN-g-AKP was dissolved in N, N-dimethylformamide and the hydrophilic PAN-g-AKP nanofiber was prepared by electrospinning. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopic results showed that the protein was grafted to PAN. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images showed that PAN-g-AKP nanofibers had good morphology with a smooth surface. X-ray diffraction (XRD) curves showed that the crystallinity of PAN-g-AKP nanofibers decreased with increased AKP content. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analyses were also performed. The hygroscopicity of PAN-g-AKP fibers improved over PAN-based fibers based on water retention rate.																	2330-5517					JUL-AUG	2015	2	4					14	19		10.14504/ajr.2.4.3							WOS:000363623200003

Cu, Fe, Mn and Zn were determined by ICP-AES, while Cd and Pb by GF-AAS technique. Two microwave assisted digestion procedures were elaborated for the preparation of 0.5-g krill samples using open and closed vessel systems. The efficiency of the digestion processes was checked by measurements of the total organic carbon content of the solutions obtained. The deviations of the analytical data from the certified values and the relative standard deviations of the concentration measurements were lower for all six elements investigated applying the closed vessel digestion system.

Accordingly, the solid phase extraction of EPA and DHA from Antarctic krill crude extracts has attracted significant research interest. This study compared the extraction of EPA and DHA from Antarctic krill crude extracts using an aminopropyl, zinc ion-doped silica, and C-18 and zinc ion-doped C-18 solid-phase column. The best extraction effect was obtained using the zinc ion-doped C-18 SPE with water containing methanol as the eluant. The efficiency increased gradually with increasing methanol concentration from 12.5 to 25% in the washing stage, and when pure methanol (5.0 mL) or acetonitrile (3.0 mL) was used as the eluant. To detect EPA and DHA, the acids were first converted to their methyl esters and detected by gas chromatography with flame ionization detection (GC-FID). In the zinc ion-doped C-18 elution fractions, EPA and DHA were isolated from the crude extracts in high yield (85-91% (r(2) = 4.8-6.3%)).

Defatted krill powder by-product generates from the process of krill oil, which is rich in various types of amino acids. This study aimed at recovering tyrosine from defatted krill by-product through enzymatic hydrolysis. Defatted krill by-product was hydrolyzed with three types of protease under optimum conditions with different incubation time. Free tyrosine dissociated from protein through hydrolysis by trypsin and was detected in the protein hydrolysates. Content of tyrosine increased with the increasing of incubation time till 5 h. Tyrosine extract contained 6.43 mg/kg fluorine and over 95 % of tyrosine, which demonstrated its high purity and safety. Tyrosine extract showed rod-shaped microstructure through scanning electron microscope analysis. Crystalline structure and thermal properties of tyrosine extract agreed well with those of l-tyrosine standard. During this process, both tyrosine of high purity and bioactive peptide products were obtained.																	1935-5130	1935-5149				APR	2016	9	4					621	627		10.1007/s11947-015-1658-x							WOS:000371614300007

Bacterial epibiont communities of panmictic Antarctic krill are spatially structured	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY												Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) are amongst the most abundant animals on Earth, with a circumpolar distribution in the Southern Ocean. Genetic and genomic studies have failed to detect any population structure for the species, suggesting a single panmictic population. However, the hyper-abundance of krill slows the rate of genetic differentiation, masking potential underlying structure. Here we use high-throughput sequencing of bacterial 16S rRNA genes to show that krill bacterial epibiont communities exhibit spatial structuring, driven mainly by distance rather than environmental factors, especially for strongly krill-associated bacteria. Estimating the ecological processes driving bacterial community turnover indicated this was driven by bacterial dispersal limitation increasing with geographic distance. Furthermore, divergent epibiont communities generated from a single krill swarm split between aquarium tanks under near-identical conditions suggests physical isolation in itself can cause krill-associated bacterial communities to diverge. Our findings show that Antarctic krill-associated bacterial communities are geographically structured, in direct contrast with the lack of structure observed for krill genetic and genomic data.

The AUV was equipped with the same type of scientific echosounder as the research vessel (Simrad EK500 operating at 38 and 120 kHz) and measured the density of krill along transect acoustically (g m(-2) wet mass) prior to the ship's arrival. We hypothesised that if krill avoided the ship, perhaps in response to radiated noise, then the ship should detect less krill than the AUV which is known to have much lower noise levels than the ship. We were unable to detect any significant difference between the density of krill detected by the ship or the AUV, either at the transect level or at finer scales within transects. We conclude, therefore, that avoidance by krill of RRS James Clark Ross will not significantly bias acoustic estimates of krill abundance by this vessel. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Thus, this study focuses on the effect and mechanism of metal ions on phospholipid oxidation in AKO. Firstly, AKO containing Mg2+, Mn2+, Cu2+, Fe2+ and Fe3+ (200 mu mol/kg) were prepared separately and incubated at 60 degrees C for 6 days. Peroxide value (POV) and malondialdehyde (MDA) content showed that Fe3+ exhibited the most effective prooxidative activity, with the prooxidative activity of Fe-2(SO4)(3) (water-soluble) being stronger than that of ferric oleate (FeOl, fat-soluble). In addition, phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) oxidation degree (more than 90%) was considerably greater than phosphatidylcholine (PC) oxidation degree (about 15%) in AKO. Differences in the structure of head group hindered chelation of PC with metal ions than PE due to electrostatic repulsion and steric hindrance. Therefore, PC significantly inhibited, while PE promoted, the oxidation of polyunsaturated triacylglycerol (TAG), like fish oil (p < 0.01).																	0308-8146	1873-7072				DEC 15	2020	333								127448	10.1016/j.foodchem.2020.127448							WOS:000567773700030	32663748

The length-frequency distribution of krill was broadly similar between predators and nets although the krill taken by diving species formed a homogeneous group which showed significant differences from krill taken by other predators and by nets. There were significant differences in the maturity/sex stage composition between nets and predators; in particular all predator species showed a consistent sex bias towards female krill. Similarities in the krill taken by macaroni (offshore feeding) and gentoo (inshore feeding) penguins and differences between krill taken by penguins and albatrosses suggest that foraging techniques were more important than foraging location in influencing the type of krill in predator diets. Most krill taken by predators were adult; most female krill were sexually active (particularly when allowance is made for misclassification bias arising from predator digestion). Because female krill are larger, and probably less maneuverable, than males, the biased sex ratio in predator diets at this time of year may reflect some combination of selectivity by predators and superior escape responses of male krill. Overall, adult, sexually active female krill, forming 40% by number of the local krill population, may comprise 60 to 70% by number and 75 to 88% by mass of the krill taken by their main seabird and seal predators at South Georgia al the time of peak local demand in February.																	0171-8630					SEP	1996	140	1-3					13	20		10.3354/meps140013							WOS:A1996VJ37700002						
J	Watkins, JL; Murray, AWA				Watkins, JL; Murray, AWA			Layers of Antarctic krill, Euphausia superba: are they just long krill swarms?	MARINE BIOLOGY												Antarctic krill, Euphausia superba Dana, a major component in the southern ocean food web, typically occur in aggregations that range from small? discrete swarms and schools through to layers and superswarms that extend horizontally for several kilometres. A large Longhurst-Hardy plankton recorder has been used to obtain high-resolution serial samples from within two layers (up to 4 km in length) that were found near Elephant Island, north of the Antarctic Peninsula. Krill length, sex and maturity stage, net and acoustic estimates of number density are shown to vary significantly within these large layers. The variation occurring within a single layer is comparable with that occurring in a set of 38 swarms sampled contemporaneously with the layers. Thus, unlike a krill swarm, a whole krill layer may account for a substantial amount of the variation in the local krill population? although individual pal-ts of the layer cannot be considered in this way. The layers play an important role in the ecology of the krill within the area. Firstly, these large layers may contain a significant proportion of the biomass within an area. Secondly, the structure of the layers gives some insight into the ways in which krill swarm formation and dispersal may be occurring.																	0025-3162					MAY	1998	131	2					237	247		10.1007/s002270050316							WOS:000074174600005

The length of Antarctic krill in the diet of Antarctic fur seals Arctocephalus gazella at South Georgia revealed a consistent increase in size between ca. 42 and ca. 54 mm over the period October-March, indicating growth rates much higher than predicted by existing models. Geographical variation in growth rate may result in 2-year-old krill at South Georgia attaining the same size as 3-year-old krill in the Antarctic Peninsula region. The effect of geographical variation in growth rate on the population structure of krill has important implications for comparing the fate of individual cohorts over large scales and in the interpretation of krill life-cycles.																	0025-3162	1432-1793				JAN	2001	138	1					57	62		10.1007/s002270000425							WOS:000166738900006						
J	Donachie, SP; Zdanowski, MK				Donachie, SP; Zdanowski, MK			Potential digestive function of bacteria in krill Euphausia superba stomach	AQUATIC MICROBIAL ECOLOGY												Evidence is presented that bacteria in the stomach of live Antarctic krill Euphausia superba participate in the digestion of host dietary components. Total (AODC: Acridine Orange Direct Count) and culturable (CFU: Colony Forming Units) bacteria in this organ in fresh adult krill were compared in numerical and physiological terms with those in contemporaneously collected seawater samples in Admiralty Bay, King George Island, South Shetland Islands. On a per unit volume basis, AODC and CFU numbers in the stomach were greater than in the seawater, and higher than could be accounted for through selective prey filtration alone. CFU in the stomach and seawater averaged similar to 4% and <0.01% of the respective AODC, and in the stomach similar to 6% of AODC were dividing, compared to less than 1% in seawater, observations suggesting that bacterial growth occurs in the stomach. Biovolume of cells in the stomach exceeded that of cells in seawater (t(2854) = -6.262, P < 0.001), but the former were too small to have been selectively filtered. Maltose and gluconate assimilation, and lipase (C-14), 'trypsin'-like, and acid phosphatase activities were significantly more prominent in culturable bacteria from the stomach than seawater, further indicating selection. Conversely, a-fucosidase production appears host derived. Yeasts isolated from the stomach were identified as Leucosporidium antarcticum and Metschnikowia australis.

Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), nutritionally important lipid components with poor oxidative stability, were used as markers of oxidation during thermal processing of Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) meal by evaluating the lipolysis, lipid oxidation, and non-enzymatic browning reactions. RESULTLiquid chromatography-mass spectrometry of the phospholipids and the main oxidation products of free fatty acids and phosphatidylcholine (PC) was effective for evaluating the oxidation of EPA and DHA. During boiling, oxidation of EPA and DHA in the free fatty acid and PC fractions and hydrolysis of the fatty acids at the sn-2 position of the phospholipids were predominant. The changes in PC during drying were mainly attributed to the oxidation of EPA and DHA. Heat treatment increased the oxidation products and concentration of hydrophobic pyrrole owing to pyrrolization between phosphatidylethanolamine and the lipid oxidation products. CONCLUSIONThe lipid oxidation level of Antarctic krill increased after drying, owing to prolonged heating under the severe conditions.

In our study, after a 14-day acclimation period, 50 female Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly assigned to five groups, each of which was fed a different diet, for 28 days. We then evaluated the effect of krill protein complex (KPC), krill powder, and defatted krill powder on the nitrogen balance, growth, and antioxidant activity through analyses of MDA, CAT, GSH-Px, and T-SOD. An in vivo analysis suggested that the nitrogen retention rate, protein digestibility, and bioutilization of krill products were equal to those of casein. Moreover, the KPC diet resulted in the highest nitrogen intake and retention among the groups, and the biological value and net protein utilization obtained with KPC were higher than those obtained with defatted krill powder, which was consistent with the weight gains observed for these two groups. The hematological test also showed that KPC contributed to the production of functional proteins in the body. The antioxidant activity analysis indicated that higher GSH-Px and T-SOD activities were obtained with krill products and KPC, respectively, compared with casein. The results from this study suggested that krill proteins could promote growth and improve the antioxidant status of an organism. Although further studies on the safety of krill products for human consumption are needed, this work provides insights into the use of krill proteins as a potential substitute for other proteins and restructured foods.

Oceanic circumpolar habitats of Antarctic krill	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												Surveys of Euphausia superba often target localised shelves and ice edges where their growth rates and predation losses are atypically high. Emphasis on these areas has led to the current view that krill require high food concentrations, with a distribution often linked to shelves. For a wider, circumpolar perspective, we compiled all available net-based density data on postlarvae from 8137 mainly summer stations from 1926 to 2004. Unlike Antarctic zooplankton, the distribution of E. superba is highly uneven, with 70% of the total stock concentrated between longitudes 0 degrees and 90 degrees W. Within this Atlantic sector, krill are abundant over both continental shelf and ocean. At the Antarctic Peninsula they are found mainly over the inner shelf, whereas in the Indian-Pacific sectors krill prevail in the ocean within 200 to 300 km of the shelf break. Overall, 87% of the total stock lives over deep oceanic water (> 2000 m), and krill occupy regions with moderate food concentrations (0.5 to 1.0 mg chl a m(-3)). Advection models suggest some northwards loss from these regions and into the low chlorophyll belts of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC). We found possible evidence for a compensating southwards migration, with an increasing proportion of krill found south of the ACC as the season progresses. The retention of krill in moderately productive oceanic habitats is a key factor in their high total production. While growth rates are lower than over shelves, the ocean provides a refuge from shelf-based predators. The unusual circumpolar distribution of krill thus reflects a balance between advection, migration, top-down and bottom-up processes.																	0171-8630	1616-1599					2008	362						1	23		10.3354/meps07498							WOS:000257849900001

Simulating larval Antarctic krill growth and condition factor during fall and winter in response to environmental variability	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												The first winter in the life cycle of Antarctic krill Euphausia superba is a critical period in which larval survival and recruitment to the adult population are highly sensitive to environmental conditions, yet little is known about larval physiological dynamics during this period. An individual-based model was developed to investigate patterns of larval krill growth and condition factor in response to environmental variability during fall and winter, west of the Antarctic Peninsula. Field and experimental observations from Southern Ocean Global Ocean Ecosystems Dynamics cruises in 2001 and 2002 and the Palmer Long-Term Ecological Research program were used to parameterize the model. Growth was modeled by partitioning total body carbon between length and condition factor. Total body carbon was simulated with empirical temperature-dependent rates of ingestion of phytoplankton and respiration, and ingestion of algae grown on a surface to simulate sea ice algae. Light-driven diel vertical migration modulated ingestion of phytoplankton and sea ice algae as a function of latitude, season and sea ice cover. Simulations highlighted 3 environmental processes that controlled food availability, and consequently, physiological condition of krill: the fall phytoplankton decline, sea ice advance and development of sea ice microbial communities, and the late winter increase in sea ice microbial community biomass. Fall phytoplankton dynamics were identified as a major driver of the physiological condition of larval krill throughout this critical period. The model presents a mechanism that links larval krill survival and recruitment to fall and winter variability in phytoplankton and sea ice dynamics along the western Antarctic Peninsula.																	0171-8630						2012	452						27	43		10.3354/meps09409							WOS:000303213900003						
J	Mori, M; Butterworth, DS				Mori, M; Butterworth, DS			Consideration of multispecies interactions in the Antarctic: A preliminary model of the minke whale - Blue whale - Krill interaction	AFRICAN JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE					Workshop on Ecosystem Approaches to Fisheries Management in the Southern Benguela	DEC 04-06, 2002	Cape Town, SOUTH AFRICA					As a first step in investigating the major predator-prey interactions in the Antarctic, a model describing blue whales Balaenoptera musculus, minke whales Balaenoptera acutorostrata and krill Euphausia superba is developed. Blue and minke whales feed mainly on krill, and they share a similar feeding area near the Antarctic ice edge. In the early 20(th) century, the large baleen whales in the Antarctic were heavily harvested, some to near extinction. Blue whales were taken for almost 60 years, before being officially protected in 1964. Harvesting of the smaller minke whales commenced only in the 1970s, and the population probably increased during the mid 20th century, likely in response to increased krill abundance following the depletion of the large baleen whales. Recent studies show recoveries of some of these large baleen whale species in response to protection, and also a possible recent decrease in the stock of minke whales as the larger whales recover. This work investigates whether the abundance trends indicated by surveys and other information for these species can be explained by considering only harvesting and the predator-prey interactions between the two whale species and krill. Using historical catch data for blue and minke whales, a simple age-aggregated model including species interactions is fitted to survey abundance estimates. Uncertainties in the abundance estimates and the biological parameters are taken into account in the process by considering plausible ranges for their values. Abundance trends for the species can broadly be replicated by the model, provided the parameter values show certain features, including (i) that blue whales are able to maintain their birth and krill consumption rates until krill abundance drops to relatively low levels, and (ii) that both minke and blue whales show relatively fast rates of growth if krill is abundant, but that minke growth rate falls more rapidly as krill abundance drops. The model suggests two interesting features of the dynamics of these species. First, a substantial decrease in krill biomass from the 1970s to the 1990s as a result of the preceding rapid increase in minke whale abundance, and hence krill consumption, following the depletion of the larger baleen whales. Second, a recovery of blue whales despite the impact of minke whales on krill abundance and its resultant decrease, because blue whales are better able to tolerate decreased krill abundance. Future projections show a gradual increasing trend in blue whale abundance and a gradual decrease in minke abundance, with large amplitude oscillations superimposed. Long-term monitoring of biological parameters and abundance are essential to provide a basis for verification or otherwise of such predictions. Results presented here should be viewed qualitatively rather than quantitatively. However, for the future, refinement of the model structure and incorporation of age structure, data on some other major predator species that feed on krill and some spatial structure, is under consideration.

Modern krill stocks have been estimated directly by net hauls and acoustic surveys; the historical krill density especially the long-term one in the Southern Ocean, however, is unknown. Here we inferred the relative krill population changes along the West Antarctic Peninsula (WAP) over the 20th century from the trophic level change of Antarctic fur seal Arctocephalus gazella using stable carbon (delta C-13) and nitrogen (delta N-15) isotopes of archival seal hairs. Since Antarctic fur seals feed preferentially on krill, the variation of delta N-15 in seal hair indicates a change in the proportion of krill in the seal's diets and thus the krill availability in local seawater. For the past century, enriching fur seal delta N-15 values indicated decreasing krill availability. This is agreement with direct observation for the past similar to 30 years and suggests that the recently documented decline in krill populations began in the early parts of the 20th century. This novel method makes it possible to infer past krill population changes from ancient tissues of krill predators.

In coastal waters, ammonium supply by mesozooplankton indicated a low contribution to fuel primary production. In oceanic waters, however, Antarctic krill Euphausia superba contributed a significant percentage to the nitrogen requirements of primary producers. Thus, the ontogenetic migration of adult krill during austral summer should be a key factor regulating the regenerated ammonium for primary production. A significant coupling of ammonium concentration in the water column and in situ krill biomass supported the significant role of krill excretion in the epipelagic realm. Results from short-term experiments with E. superba indicated that ammonium excretion rates were much higher than previously found. Because the use of experimental metabolic rates that are close to field rates would be more appropriate, we suggest to re-assess the ammonium supplied by the epipelagic marine biota. Moreover, the outcomes of experimental krill excretion rates, in situ measurements of ammonium and a review of data on primary production suggest that Antarctic krill sustain a high proportion of the daily phytoplankton production.

Depth-discrete samples of krill were taken with a 1 m(2) MOCNESS net at the cardinal times of day (midnight, midday, sunrise and sunset). Specimens were immediately measured and categorised for moulting and spawning status. Further samples were preserved for detailed analysis in the home laboratory. Results showed that the population concentrated in the deep (80 to 100 m) during day-time but segregated vertically during nighttime. Moulting occurred in the deep during night-time, away from the main part of the non-moulting population, which was located between 80 and 50 m. Spawning females were most evident in the up permost depth interval (30 to 5 m). Moulting at night in the deepest layers may be viewed as a mechanism to avoid cannibalism whilst in a vulnerable condition. Spawning in the warm upper layers accelerates reproductive processes and may also reduce the depth to which the eggs sink before hatching into nauplii.																	0171-8630	1616-1599					1999	190						253	262		10.3354/meps190253							WOS:000084553000019

The hydrogen bonds of SA/AKP composite material were analyzed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) and Nuclear magnetic resonance hydrogen spectrum (HNMR). Experiment manifested the existence of intermolecular and intramolecular hydrogen bonds in SA/AKP system; strength of intermolecular hydrogen bond enhanced with the increase of AKP in the composite material and the interaction strength of hydrogen bonding followed the order: OH... Ether 0 > OH...pi > OH...N. The percentage of intermolecular hydrogen bond decreased with increase of pH. At the same time, the effect of hydrogen bonds on properties of the composite material was discussed. The increase of intermolecular hydrogen bonding led to the decrease of crystallinity, increase of apparent viscosity and surface tension, as well as obvious decrease of heat resistance of SA/AKP composite material. SA/ARP fiber SEM images and energy spectrum showed that crystallized salt was separated from the fiber, which possibly led to the fibrillation of the composite fibers. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The results revealed that in freeze-dried Antarctic krill levels of DBP (0.1043 +/- 0.0005 mg g(-1) (104.3 +/- 0.05 mg kg(-1))) were high. The structure of DBP in Antarctic krill was determined by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Its existence is of concern based on demonstrated harmful effects to animals and plants as Antarctic krill is a key part of the food chain in Antarctic coastal marine ecosystems. The adverse effects of DBP on Antarctic krill and the source of DBP should be explored in further research.																	0954-1020	1365-2079				DEC	2017	29	6					511	516		10.1017/S0954102017000281							WOS:000423172800005

Antarctic krill were either kept individually or in groups for 8 months under different temperature and food conditions, and the succession of female maturity stages and intermoult periods were observed. In all cases regression and re-maturation of external sexual characteristics were observed, but there were differences in length of the cycle and intermoult periods between the experimental conditions. Based on these results, and information available from previous studies, we suggest a conceptual model describing seasonal cycle of krill physiology which provides a framework for future studies and highlight the importance of its link to the timings of the environmental conditions.

Our major observations are: (1) respiration rates were reduced by 30 to 50% in autumn and winter, compared to values in late spring; (2) feeding activity was reduced by 80 to 86% in autumn and winter, compared to late spring, at similar food concentrations; (3) feeding was omnivorous during winter; (4) with each moult, krill grew by 0.5 to 3.8%, in length; (5) body lipids and, to a small extent, body proteins were consumed during winter. Adult Euphausia superba thus adopt metabolic slowdown and omnivorous feeding activity at low rates to survive the winter season in the Lazarev Sea. By mid autumn, metabolic activity is reduced, most likely being influenced by the Antarctic light regime, which is accompanied by a reduction in feeding activity and growth. Although at a low level, the feeding activity during winter seems to provide an important energy input.

The northern krill, Meganyctiphanes norvegica, is extremely widely distributed from the arctic North Atlantic to the warm Mediterranean. Respiration measurements showed no seasonal differences in rates determined in krill from the thermally stable Clyde Sea (Scotland) and the cooler but variable Danish Kattegat. In the warm Ligurian Sea. where temperatures are stable, krill showed higher rates in April than in September. indicating reactions to the short but intensive productive season. Krill can passively benefit from enhancements of overall metabolism when ascending into upper. warmer water strata during their pronounced diel vertical migration. Michaelis-Menten constants (K-m) of citrate synthase (CS) were compared. In terms of respiration and enzyme regulation, krill from the Ligurian Sea stand apart: temperature and nutrition appear to be of different influence. relatable to genetic differentiation in the species. In contrast, K-m of CS in E. superba is temperature independent, highlighting the species stenothermal physiology. A basal level of activity of digestive enzymes ensures immediate utilization of patchy food sources. Specific induction, including that of chitinases, indicating omnivory in both species, underlines krill's exceptional capacity to adapt to highly variable trophic environments. Processes of moult, growth, and reproduction are locally and seasonally adjusted.

Oceanic swarms of Antarctic krill perform satiation sinking	PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES												Antarctic krill form some of the highest concentrations of animal biomass observed in the world's oceans potentially due to their prolific ability to swarm. Determining the movement of Antarctic krill within swarms is important to identify drivers of their behaviour and their biogeochemical impact on their environment. We examined vertical velocity within approximately 2000 krill swarms through the combined use of a shipborne echosounder and an acoustic Doppler current profiler. We revealed a pronounced downward anomaly in vertical velocity within swarms of -0.6 cm s(-1) compared with vertical motion outside the swarm. The anomaly changed over the diel cycle, with smaller downward anomalies occurring at night. Swarms in regions of high phytoplankton concentrations (a proxy for food availability) also exhibited significantly smaller downward anomalies. We propose that the anomaly is the result of downward velocities generated by the action of krill beating their swimming appendages. During the night and in high phytoplankton availability, when krill are more likely to feed to the point of satiation, swimming activity is lowered and the anomaly is reduced. Our findings are consistent with laboratory work where krill ceased swimming and adopted a parachute posture when sated. Satiation sinking behaviour can substantially increase the efficiency of carbon transport to depth through depositing faecal pellets at the bottom of swarms, avoiding the reingestion and break-up of pellets by other swarm members.

Analysis of ROV Video Imagery for Krill Identification and Counting under Antarctic Sea Ice	2008 IEEE/OES AUTONOMOUS UNDERWATER VEHICLES	IEEE OES Autonomous Underwater Vehicles				IEEE/OES Autonomous Underwater Vehicles Conference (AUV 2008)	OCT 13-14, 2008	Woods Hole, MA	IEEE, OES				An off-the-shelf SeaBotix ROV was deployed under Antarctic sea ice near Palmer Station Antarctica during the Sept-Oct 2007 Sea Ice Mass Balance in the Antarctic (SIMBA) project from the research vessel NB Painter. Video imagery taken showed significant numbers of Antarctic krill (sp. Euphasia Superba and/or Euphasia Crystallorophis) under the sea ice at the two stations deployed. The goal of this image analysis is to estimate the krill population densities, as well, as to identify other life forms. The relative motion between the krill and vehicle complicate the video analysis process. The avoidance behavior of the krill adds to this challenge along with the changing lighting conditions under the ice. We discuss these challenges and the algorithms that are under development in this paper. The ROV videos were converted into a string of images, which were used to simulate a running speed of 3 frames/second (fps). A 5 second clip (15 frames) was selected as an initial test for the vision software. The LabVIEW (R) Vision Builder AI software has been selected as an image processing platform, which allows us to rapidly prototype algorithms. We have applied noise reduction techniques to reduce some of the noise. Edge detection filters (such as, but not limited to the Roberts Filter) have been applied to further reduce the image's noise level and to increase the contrast between the krill and the water. Next, we applied thresholds to detect the object, which was subsequently used to identify and count and log the number of distinct objects in the image. Once all of the parameters were set, the 15 images were cycled through the configured inspection in chronological order to simulate an actual inspection of the ROV video. The results of our automated krill population estimate to that of humans counting the krill manually using the same video was conducted. We found that illumination and image quality allowed the most prominent individuals in proximity of the camera to be counted. However, because of background noise and low scattering of some individuals the filtering removed suspected individuals that would suggest this krill density is significantly underestimated. The technique however appears practical. In considering the motion of the krill relative to the vehicle, tracking becomes paramount. Plans for implementing this technique in ongoing development is discussed.																	1522-3167		978-1-4244-2938-7				2008							55	+									WOS:000274806100009

Decreases in krill abundance could result in a major ecological regime shift, but there is limited information on how climate change may affect krill. Increasing anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions are causing ocean acidification, as absorption of atmospheric CO2 in seawater alters ocean chemistry. Ocean acidification increases mortality and negatively affects physiological functioning in some marine invertebrates, and is predicted to occur most rapidly at high latitudes. Here we show that, in the laboratory, adult krill are able to survive, grow, store fat, mature, and maintain respiration rates when exposed to near-future ocean acidification (1000-2000 mu atm pCO(2)) for one year. Despite differences in seawater pCO(2) incubation conditions, adult krill are able to actively maintain the acid-base balance of their body fluids in near-future pCO(2), which enhances their resilience to ocean acidification.

Incorrect growth models, specifically those giving unrealistically high production, could lead to over-exploitation of the krill population if those models are used in setting catch limits. Here we review available approaches to modelling productivity and note that existing models do not account for the interactions between growth and reproduction and variable environmental conditions. We develop a new energetics moult-cycle (EMC) model which combines energetics and the constraints on growth of the moult-cycle. This model flexibly accounts for regional, inter- and intra-annual variation in temperature, food supply, and day length. The EMC model provides results consistent with the general expectations for krill growth in length and mass, including having thin krill, as well as providing insights into the effects that increasing temperature may have on growth and reproduction. We recommend that this new model be incorporated into assessments of catch limits for Antarctic krill.

A.			Size and stage composition of age class 0 Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) in the ice-water interface layer during winter/early spring	POLAR BIOLOGY												The condition and survival of Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) strongly depends on sea ice conditions during winter. How krill utilize sea ice depends on several factors such as region and developmental stage. A comprehensive understanding of sea ice habitat use by krill, however, remains largely unknown. The aim of this study was to improve the understanding of the krill's interaction with the sea ice habitat during winter/early spring by conducting large-scale sampling of the ice-water interface (0-2 m) and comparing the size and developmental stage composition of krill with the pelagic population (0-500 m). Results show that the population in the northern Weddell Sea consisted mainly of krill that were <1 year old (age class 0; AC0), and that it was comprised of multiple cohorts. Size per developmental stage differed spatially, indicating that the krill likely were advected from various origins. The size distribution of krill differed between the two depth strata sampled. Larval stages with a relatively small size (mean 7-8 mm) dominated the upper two metre layer of the water column, while larger larvae and AC0 juveniles (mean 14-15 mm) were proportionally more abundant in the 0- to 500-m stratum. Our results show that, as krill mature, their vertical distribution and utilization of the sea ice appear to change gradually. This could be the result of changes in physiology and/or behaviour, as, e.g., the krill's energy demand and swimming capacity increase with size and age. The degree of sea ice association will have an effect on large-scale spatial distribution patterns of AC0 krill and on predictions of the consequences of sea ice decline on their survival over winter.

Ecological niche modeling of sympatric krill predators around Marguerite Bay, Western Antarctic Peninsula	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY												Adelie penguins (Pygoscelis adeliae), carabeater seals (Lobodon carcinophagus), humpback (Megaptera novaeangliae), and minke whales (Balaenoptera bonaernsis) are found in the waters surrounding the Western Antarctic Peninsula. Each species relies primarily on Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) and has physiological constraints and foraging behaviors that dictate their ecological niches. Understanding the degree of ecological overlap between sympatric krill predators is critical to understanding and predicting the impacts on climate-driven changes to the Antarctic marine ecosystem. To explore ecological relationships amongst sympatric krill predators, we developed ecological niche models using a maximum entropy modeling approach (Maxent) that allows the integration of data collected by a variety of means (e.g. satellite-based locations and visual observations). We created spatially explicit probability distributions for the four krill predators in fall 2001 and 2002 in conjunction with a suite of environmental variables. We find areas within Marguerite Bay with high krill predator occurrence rates or biological hot spots. We find the modeled ecological niches for Adelie penguins and crabeater seals may be affected by their physiological needs to haul-out on substrate. Thus, their distributions may be less dictated by proximity to prey and more so by physical features that over time provide adequate access to prey. Humpback and minke whales, being fully marine and having greater energetic demands, occupy ecological niches more directly proximate to prey. We also find evidence to suggest that the amount of overlap between modeled niches is relatively low, even for species with similar energetic requirements. In a rapidly changing and variable environment, our modeling work shows little indication that krill predators maintain similar ecological niches across years around Marguerite Bay. Given the amount of variability in the marine environment around the Antarctic Peninsula and how this affects the local abundance of prey, there may be consequences for krill predators with historically little niche overlap to increase the potential for interspecific competition for shared prey resources.

These strains were identified by 16s rDNA sequence analysis and grouped into eight different genera, including Bacillus, Shewanella, Psychrobacter, Klebsiella, Macrococcus, Aeromonas, Acinetobacter, and Saccharomyces. After fermentation of Antarctic krill powder using these strains, bioactive compounds including total phenolics, free amino acids, and enzyme activities were investigated. Meanwhile, antioxidant activities of the fermentation liquors were also detected. Results showed that bioactive compounds could be effectively produced through fermentation process by these strains, of which three strains (Bacillus subtilis OKF04, Macrococcus caseolyticus OKF09, and Aeromonas veronii OKF10) could produce more than 650 mg/L total phenolics or 2000 mg/L total free amino acids. In terms of enzyme activities, almost all of the strains showed protease activity and amylase activity, but only Bacillus cereus OKF01 and Bacillus megaterium OKF05 performed lipase activity and chitinase activity, respectively. All of the fermentation liquors showed antioxidant activity, within which Bacillus megaterium OKF05, Macrococcus caseolyticus OKF09, and Aeromonas veronii OKF10 displayed it more prominently. These results demonstrate that the Antarctic krill powder could be effectively converted by microorganisms isolated from deep-sea mud for production of bioactive compounds mixture.

Their effects on the state of water in myofibrils of lizard fish and dehydration-induced denaturation were compared with those from two species of shrimp, glucose, and sodium glutamate. Peptides are major components in hydrolysates, occupying approximately 85-93% of the total materials. The Antarctic krill protein hydrolysates stabilized the bonding of water molecules, leading to suppressed denaturation of myofibrils during the dehydration process. Similar effects were observed for shrimp protein hydrolysates. The effect of the hydrolysate was less than that by glucose and sodium glutamate.																	0919-9268					JUN	2002	68	3					672	679		10.1046/j.1444-2906.2002.00476.x							WOS:000176695800028						
J	Veit, RR				Veit, RR			Behavioural responses by foraging petrels to swarms of Antarctic Krill Euphausia superba	ARDEA												Petrels feeding on Antarctic Krill Euphausia superba use two basic strategies to locate prey patches. One strategy is area-restricted search, in which individuals interrupt straight-line motion on detecting prey, and then circle about. This increased rate of turning near prey increases the likelihood of detecting additional patches, since patches tend to be clumped in space. A second strategy is local enhancement, in which individuals monitor the behaviour of others, and converge on those individuals that display behaviour indicative of feeding. In this paper, attention is focused on the first strategy, area restricted search, and evidence of increased turning rates in the vicinity of krill patches is sought. The hypotheses tested were first, that six species of krill-feeding petrels engage in area restricted search; and then that the tendency for seabirds to either sit on the water, patter with their feet, or seize prey was correlated with the distance to the nearest krill patch. Seabird abundance and behaviour was paired with krill abundance east of South Georgia (55 degrees S, 35 degrees W) in June 1993. Three species, Cape Petrel Daption capense, Northern Giant Petrel Macronectes halli and Southern Giant Petrel M. giganteus, changed their direction of Eight significantly more often when near krill swarms than when in krill-free areas, indicating that they used area restricted search. Cape Petrels were also significantly more likely to sit on the water and to patter along the surface when close to krill swarms.																	0373-2266						1999	87	1					41	50									WOS:000083232300004						
J	Johnson, ML; Tarling, GA				Johnson, Magnus L.; Tarling, Geraint A.			Influence of individual state on swimming capacity and behaviour of Antarctic krill Euphausia superba	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												Swarms of Antarctic krill are frequently biased towards certain body sizes, sexes, maturities and physiological states. However, the mechanisms causing such biases remain unclear, with some speculating on differential responses to chemical or visual cues. This study examines the influence of individual state on swimming behaviour and performance, which, in turn, may cause biases in swarm composition. The frequency and strength of pleopod beats as well as the overall swimming capacity of Antarctic krill Euphausia superba were measured using a tethering technique. Individual state was considered in terms of body size, sex, maturity, moult stage and stomach fullness. Significant differences in the rate and strength of pleopod strokes as well as in the overall swimming capacity were found between individuals in different states. Body size had one of the strongest influences, with beat rate decreasing and beat strength increasing with increasing size. The sex and maturity of an individual altered this pattern, with adult females having faster but weaker pleopod beats than males of equivalent size. The difference in swimming style of females may impose a different lifestyle to that of males. Moult stage also had a significant influence on swimming, with moulting/post-moult individuals having significantly lower swimming capacities, making them unlikely to keep pace with intermoult counterparts. Both the rate and the strength of the pleopod beat were significantly lower in satiated compared to unsatiated individuals, which may contribute to the dispersion of swarms during feeding.

Population genetic structure of this species was investigated by sequence analysis of the,ND1 mitochondrial gene in four population samples collected at different geographical localities around the Antarctic continent. Results indicate the existence of significant genetic differences between samples, and we suggest that oceanographic barriers could be sufficiently strong and temporally stable to restrict gene flow between distinct areas. Moreover, our data indicate that Antarctic krill is not at mutation-drift equilibrium and that the species possibly has a low effective population size as compared to the census size.

The measurement of temporal increases in quantities of fluorescent age-pigments has been suggested as a method which obviates the problems associated with size-related measures of age. In this study, a laboratory population of Antarctic krill exhibited a clear increase in the mean amount of fluorescent age-pigment per animal over a period of 1 yr. At the same time the mean weight of the animalsin the population decreased markedly-body shrinkage. Analyses of fluorescence- and weight-frequency plots from samples taken a year apart demonstrated that the fluorescence technique could successfully discriminate the two year groups and determine their correct temporal sequence whereas the weight frequency analysis was less successful at discriminating the two peaks and placed them in an incorrect temporal sequence. On the basis of these results it is suggested that age-pigment fluorescence may now be a useful tool in the analysis of age-structure in populations of Antarctic krill.																	0022-0981						1991	146	2					153	161		10.1016/0022-0981(91)90022-O							WOS:A1991FJ85900002

Age, Growth, Mortality, and Recruitment of Antarctic Krill, Euphausia superba	BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY OF ANTARCTIC KRILL	Advances in Polar Ecology											Laboratory and field studies on the age, growth, mortality, and recruitment dynamics of Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba; hereafter "krill") have greatly increased knowledge of its life history over the last 30 years. The development of long, standardized time series of recruitment and abundance have provided data to test and refine conceptual models of krill recruitment, and to examine the role of environmental factors and climatic variability on recruitment and cohort size. Laboratory studies have also greatly increased knowledge about intrinsic and extrinsic factors governing growth and moulting frequency that have been used to develop more robust models for krill growth. These findings have demonstrated the plasticity of krill life history and can provide the foundation for understanding krill population response to future climate change. However, the lack of progress on the development of conservative, direct measures of krill age continue to hamper the ability to properly compare and contrast growth and recruitment across environments.																	2468-5712		978-3-319-29279-3; 978-3-319-29277-9				2016							101	144		10.1007/978-3-319-29279-3_3	10.1007/978-3-319-29279-3						WOS:000401843300004

For somatic growth, empirical estimates of variation are rare because they often require expensive long-term tag-recapture programs. In marine pelagic ecosystems, where many species are difficult to sample and not amenable to tagging studies, researchers have relied on estimating growth from length-frequency distributions. We developed a general approach for estimating growth from observed length-frequency samples by combining kernel density estimates of the length-frequency distribution and the von Bertalanffy growth function. Our approach is conceptually straightforward and easy to implement. We applied the methods to Antarctic krill Euphausia superba collected from the Southern Ocean over a span of 19 yr to document among-year variation in krill growth during the austral summer. Our estimates of growth align closely with existing estimates of growth, but we provide the first estimates of among-year variation in krill growth. We estimate very high among-year variation in growth (annual estimates for a 30 mm krill in the Elephant Island region ranged from 0.00 to 0.17 mm d(-1); mean = 0.073, among-year coefficient of variation approximate to 0.8). We correlated growth rate variation to estimates of ocean chlorophyll but not to other oceanographic indices, contrasting with results from previous studies. The large amount of variation in growth unexplained by environmental covariates has substantial implications for ecosystem management in the Southern Ocean ecosystem.																	0171-8630	1616-1599					2013	481						53	67		10.3354/meps10245							WOS:000318566400005

Antarctic krill defluoridated hydrolysate products (DHPs) generally have a bitter taste that is unacceptable to consumers. Therefore, it is necessary to improve the flavor of defluoridated hydrolysate. In this work, flavor improvement of DHPs by the Maillard reaction was evaluated by sensory analysis, electronic nose (E-nose), and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The potential correlations among the signals of sensory attributes, E-nose, and volatile components were analyzed using the analysis of partial least squares regression (PLSR). A total of 63 volatile compounds were identified and quantified via GC-MS. The flavors in Maillard reaction products were mainly attributed to pyrazines, aldehydes, ketones, and furans. After the Maillard reaction, the two main aromatic compounds generated were 3-ethyl-2,5-dimethylpyrazin (roast odor, OAV = 32.7) and 3-(methylthio) propionaldehyde (shrimp meat odor, OAV = 16.43), which contributed to flavor improvement in DHPs. PLSR results showed a good correlation between most variables of sensory attributes, E-nose, and volatile compounds, which indicates that the overall flavor of DHPs was improved by the Maillard reaction.																	1049-8850	1547-0636				MAR 15	2020	29	3					279	292		10.1080/10498850.2020.1723764		FEB 2020					WOS:000513415500001

In the context of predicted global warming, it is particularly important to understand how classic biomarkers of heat stress function in this species. In this respect, Hsp70s are acknowledged as good candidates. However, previous studies of expression kinetics have not been able to demonstrate significant upregulation of these genes in response to heat shocks at 3 degrees C and 6 degrees C for 3 and 6 h. The current work complements these previous results and broadens the prospects for the use of Hsp70s as a relevant marker of thermal shock in this krill species. New experiments demonstrate that induction of Hsp70 isoforms was not detected during exposure to heat shock, but increased expression was observed after several hours of recovery. To complete the analysis of the expression kinetics of the different isoforms, experiments were carried out over short time scales (1 and 2 h at 3 degrees C and 6 degrees C) as well as at higher temperatures (9 degrees C, 12 degrees C, and 15 degrees C for 3 h), without any significant response. A 6-week monitoring of animals at 3 degrees C showed that the time factor is decisive in the establishment of the response. CTmax experiments with incremental times of 1 degrees C per day or 1 degrees C every 3 days have shown a particularly high resilience of the animals. The demonstration of the abundance of Hsp70s present before thermal stress in various species of krill, as well as in specimens of E. superba of various origins, showed that the delay in the response in expression could be related to the high constitutive levels of Hsp70 available before the stress experiments. The alternative labelling of the two main isoforms of Hsp70 according to the origin of the animals allowed hypotheses to be put forward on the functioning of thermoregulation in Antarctic krill as well as ice krill.

The effect of FJH-KO on the development and severity of MIA-induced osteoarthritis was assessed using hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining and micro-CT. The expression of PGE(2), pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1 beta, TNF-alpha), and arthritics related genes in osteoarthritic rats in response to FJH-KO supplementation was investigated using real time PCR. FJH-KO supplementation in the arthritic rat model reduced tissue damage, cartilage degeneration, and reduced the MIA-induced irregularities in articular cartilage surface. Serum PGE(2), IL-1 beta, IL-6, and TNF-alpha levels were higher in MIA treated animals, but these levels decreased upon FJH-KO supplementation. When FJH-KO was provided at a dose of 150 mg/kg b.w to MIA-treated animals, it significantly increased the mRNA expression of anabolic factors. The mRNA expression of catabolic factors was significantly decreased MIA-treated animals that were provided FJH-KO at a dose of 100 and 150 mg/kg b.w. Moreover, the mRNA expression of inflammatory mediators was significantly decreased MIA-treated animals supplemented with FJH-KO. These results suggest supplementation with FJH-KO ameliorates the irregularities in articular cartilage surface and improves the inflammatory response in the osteoarthritis. Thus, FJH-KO could serve as a potential therapeutic agent for osteoarthritis treatment.																		2072-6643				NOV	2020	12	11							3550	10.3390/nu12113550							WOS:000593790400001	33233504

Omega-3 nutraceuticals, climate change and threats to the environment: The cases of Antarctic krill and Calanus finmarchicus	AMBIO												The nutraceutical market for EPA (eicosapentaenoic acid) and DHA (docosahexaenoic acid) is promoting fishing for Euphasia superba (Antarctic krill) in the Southern Ocean and Calanus finmarchicus in Norwegian waters. This industry argues that these species are underexploited, but they are essential in their ecosystems, and climate change is altering their geographical distribution. In this perspective, we advocate the cessation of fishing for these species to produce nutraceuticals with EPA and DHA. We argue that this is possible because, contrary to what this industry promotes, the benefits of these fatty acids only seem significant to specific population groups, and not for the general population. Next, we explain that this is desirable because there is evidence that these fisheries may interact with the impact of climate change. Greener sources of EPA and DHA are already available on the market, and their reasonable use would ease pressure on the Arctic and Antarctic ecosystems.

Do krill fisheries compete with macaroni penguins? Spatial overlap in prey consumption and catches during winter	DIVERSITY AND DISTRIBUTIONS												Aim To infer the potential for competition between an important Antarctic predator, the macaroni penguin, and the krill fishery by examining the spatial overlap in prey consumption and catches. Location Scotia Sea and adjacent waters. Methods The study focused on the winter period as this is the only time of the year when spatio-temporal overlaps between macaroni penguin foraging and the krill fishery can occur. We tracked adult macaroni penguins from a colony in South Georgia using global location sensors to determine winter distribution, and bioenergetics models to calculate the biomass of food consumed during the winter period. We combined these to produce a surface of the tonnes of krill consumed, which could be compared directly with the spatial distribution of the tonnes of krill caught by the fishery. Results Adult macaroni penguins from South Georgia consumed 135,826 tonnes of krill (95% CIs: 83,446-188,140) during the winter, which is similar to the 98,431 tonnes caught by fisheries over the same period. However, macaroni penguins had a very wide pelagic distribution across the Scotia Sea, whereas the fishery was restricted to three small areas on shelf edges, such that their spatial overlap was negligible. The proportion of the estimated krill stock taken by macaroni penguins and the krill fishery was small at both the scale of the Scotia Sea and the local areas within which the fisheries operate. Main conclusions Competition between macaroni penguins and the krill fishery is low under current management and far less than that among the various species of krill predators that occur in the Scotia Sea. Our method will allow quantification of changes in competition between macaroni penguins and krill fisheries should the latter expand in the future, and provides a framework for assessing predator-fishery competition in other systems.

J	Yoshitomi, B				Yoshitomi, B			Seasonal variation of crude digestive protease activity in Antarctic krill Euphausia superba	FISHERIES SCIENCE												Crude krill digestive protease (CKP) was extracted on board a fishing vessel from fresh whole krill caught around the Antarctic Peninsula, and its protease activity was measured by using the azocasein method. CKP activity was high from December to February (in summer) and was low from March to August (in winter). CKP activity and mean feed intake index had a high correlation coefficient by Pearson's correlation coefficient test (P < 0.05). These results suggest that the seasonal variation of CKP activity coincides with the seasonal prevalence of some phytoplanktons as feed for krill. In summer, phytoplankton is plentiful so that krill teed on them and the krill protease activity remains high, but in winter phytoplankton abundance is low and krill do not have to keep their proteolytic activity high.																	0919-9268	1444-2906				FEB	2005	71	1					12	19		10.1111/j.1444-2906.2005.00925.x							WOS:000227249900002

The optimal pH and temperature for the activity of the purified TGase were pH 8.0-9.0 and 0-10 degrees C, respectively. However, the TGase activity reduced to 50% at a higher temperature of 45 degrees C. The cations Ca++ and Na+ activated the purified TGase activity optimally at levels of incorporation of 10 mM and 1.8 mM, respectively. Addition of TGase at 0.1 U/mg increased the gel strength (p < 0.05), setting temperature, setting time (p < 0.05) and melting temperature (p < 0.05) of cold-set gelatin gel. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Siwek, M; Galunsky, B; Niemeyer, B				Siwek, M; Galunsky, B; Niemeyer, B			Isolation of selenium organic species from antarctic krill after enzymatic hydrolysis	ANALYTICAL AND BIOANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY												Total selenium content and its distribution in the soluble and insoluble protein-bound fractions obtained after aqueous extraction of antarctic krill samples were determined. About 26% of the total selenium (2.4 mu g g(-1) dry weight) was found in the supernatant; the rest was in the pellet. Isolation of low molecular selenium-containing fractions was also performed by enzymatic digestion of the protein, followed by size-exclusion chromatography in conjunction with atomic absorption spectrometry. From the applied various proteinases (pronase E, subtilisin Carlsberg, trypsin, chymotrypsin, proteinase and proteinase N from Bacillus subtilis and Novo 0.6 MPX enzyme), the treatment with pronase E led to best recovery of selenium. About 96% of the total Se was found in the hydrolysate, mainly in low molecular weight fractions. Eighty percent of the Se species were in fractions with molecular weights in the range of amino acids and short peptides. High-performance liquid chromatography/inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (HPLC-ICP-MS) allowed the identification of selenomethionine and the assumption that selenocystine or its derivatives were the main species in these fractions.																	1618-2642					FEB	2005	381	3					737	741		10.1007/s00216-004-2936-z							WOS:000227697400027	15655670

Male Antarctic fur seals: neglected food competitors of bioindicator species in the context of an increasing Antarctic krill fishery	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS												The fishery for Antarctic krill is currently managed using a precautionary, ecosystem-based approach to limiting catch, with performance indices from a long-term monitoring program focused on several krill-dependent predators that are used to track ecosystem health. Concerns over increased fishing in concentrated areas and ongoing efforts to establish a Marine Protected Area along the Peninsula, a key fishing region, is driving the development of an adaptive management system for the fishery. The cumulative effects of fishing effort and interactions among krill-dependent predators and their performance is at present neglected in the CCAMLR Ecosystem Monitoring Program. However, we show considerable overlap between male Antarctic fur seals and the krill fishery in a complex mosaic, suggesting potential for cumulative impacts on other krill dependent predators. A holistic view is required as part of future efforts to manage the krill fishery that incorporates various sources of potential impacts on the performance of bioindicator species, including the fishery and its interactions with various krill dependent predators.

Results showed that BEW reduced 30.9% (w/w) NaOH consumption for the extraction of krill proteins, and its negative redox potential (-800 similar to -900 mV) protected the active groups (carbonyl, free sulfhydryl, etc.) of the proteins from oxidation compared to deionized water (DW). Moreover, the ultrasound-assisted BEW increased the extraction yield (9.4%), improved the solubility (8.5%), reduced the particle size (57 nm), favored the transition of a-helix and beta-turn to beta-sheet, promoted the surface hydrophobicity and disulfide bonds formation of krill proteins when compared to BEW without ultrasound. These changes contributed to the enhanced foam capacity, foam stability and emulsifying capacity of the krill proteins. Notably, all the physicochemical, structural and functional properties of the krill proteins were comparable to those extracted by the traditional ultrasound-assisted DW. This study suggests that the ultrasound-assisted BEW can be a potential candidate to extract proteins, especially offering an alternative way to produce marine proteins with high nutritional quality.

Inhibition of DPP-IV may improve glycemic control in diabetics by preventing the rapid breakdown of incretin hormones and prolonging their physiological action. In this study, Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) protein was hydrolyzed using animal proteolytic enzymes. The hydrolysate was purified sequentially by ultrafiltration, gel filtration chromatography and reversed phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC). DPP-IV inhibitory activity of the fractions achieved. from Antarctic krill protein was determined by DPP-IV screening reagent kit. Two purified peptides were identified by Xevo G2-XS QTof mass spectrometer (QTOF-MS). One peptide purified was Ala-Pro (AP) with IC50 values of 0.0530 mg/mL, the other Ile-Pro-Ala (IPA) with IC50 values of 0.0370 mg/mL. They both exhibited strong DPP-IV inhibitory activity. The molecular docking analysis revealed that DPP-IV inhibition by AP and IPA was mainly due to formation of a strong interaction surface force with the 91-96 and 101-105 amino acids of the DPP-IV. Our results suggested that the protein hydrolysate from Antarctic krill can be considered as a promising natural source of DPP-IV inhibitory peptides in the management of diabetes.																	1570-0232	1873-376X				OCT 1	2017	1064						56	61		10.1016/j.jchromb.2017.09.001							WOS:000412958100009	28915418

It resides in cold environments with the most abundant biomass to support the Antarctic ecology and fisheries. Here, we performed the first genome survey of the Antarctic krill, with genomic evidence for its estimated genome size of 42.1 gigabases (Gb). Such a large genome, however, is beyond our present capability to obtain a good assembly, although our sequencing data are a valuable genetic resource for subsequent polar biomedical research. We extracted 13 typical protein-coding gene sequences of the mitochondrial genome and analyzed simple sequence repeats (SSRs), which are useful for species identification and origin determination. Meanwhile, we conducted a high-throughput comparative identification of putative antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) and antihypertensive peptides (AHTPs) from whole-body transcriptomes of the Antarctic krill and its well-known counterpart, the whiteleg shrimp (Penaeus vannamei; resident in warm waters). Related data revealed that AMPs/AMP precursors and AHTPs were generally conserved, with interesting variations between the two crustacean species. In summary, as the first report of estimated genome size of the Antarctic krill, our present genome survey data provide a foundation for further biological research into this polar species. Our preliminary investigations on bioactive peptides will bring a new perspective for the in-depth development of novel marine drugs.

J	Conti, SG; Demer, DA				Conti, SG; Demer, DA			Improved parameterization of the SDWBA for estimating krill target strength	ICES JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE												Recently, a Stochastic Distorted Wave Born Approximation (SDWBA) model was proposed to improve target strength (TS) estimates for Antarctic krill, Euphausia superba. The krill shape is modelled by a collection of cylinders, and total sound scatter is estimated by semi-coherent summation of scatter from each element. The SDWBA model was evaluated with a generic krill shape comprising 14 cylinders and a phase variability of root 2/2 radians, and predictions were validated with empirical TS and total TS data at 120 kHz, and over a broad bandwidth, respectively. For general application, parameterization of the SDWBA model is improved to account explicitly for dependence among four of the model parameters: standard length of krill, number of cylinders used to describe its shape, amplitude of inter-element phase variability, and acoustic frequency. The model improvements are demonstrated, and the uncertainty in orientation distribution of krill beneath survey vessels and its ramifications on krill biomass estimates are highlighted.

Identifying overlap between humpback whale foraging grounds and the Antarctic krill fishery	BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION												The Antarctic krill fishery is the largest in the southern ocean, but currently operates without fine-scale information on whale movement and behavior. Using a multi-year dataset of satellite-tagged whales, as well as information on krill catch levels, we analyzed the spatial distribution of whales and fisheries effort within the small-scale management units defined by the Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR). Using a Bayesian movement model to partition whale movement into traveling and area restricted search states, we found that both whale behavior and krill catch effort were spatially clustered, with distinct hotspots of the whale activity in the Gerlache and southern Branfield Straits. These areas align with increases in krill fishing effort, and present potential areas of current and future conflict. We recommend that the Antarctic West and Bransfield Strait West management units merit particular attention when setting fine-scale catch limits and, more broadly, consideration as critical areas for krill predator foraging.

At present, the research about Antarctic krill phospholipid (KOPL) mainly focuses on the purification, and there are few reports on the anti-obesity effect. Thus, this study aimed at evaluating the effect of KOPL on the high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity mice. All the mice were divided into five groups, which were fed chow diet, HFD, and different doses of KOPL + HFD, respectively. The results showed that KOPL treatment could reduce the weight gain, fat accumulation, and liver tissue damage in HFD-induced mice. KOPL treatment could reduce the levels of serum lipid (TC, TG, L-LDL) and fasting blood glucose in HFD-induced mice, and the inflammatory cytokines (IL-1 beta and TNF-alpha) in serum. Further analysis showed that KOPL could promote the normal expression of lipid-synthesis-related genes and proteins, including sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c), fatty acid synthetase (FAS), and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPAR-alpha) in liver tissue. Besides, it inhibited the overexpression of inflammatory cytokine genes (IL-1 beta and TNF-alpha), but increased the expression of tight junction genes (ZO-1 and Occludin) in the colon tissue. Additionally, KOPL improved the decrease of diversity and imbalance of intestinal microbiota, which could contribute to its beneficial effects. In summary, the KOPL treatment improves the effects of HFD-induced obese mice by maintaining normal lipid levels, protecting the liver tissue, reducing inflammation response and intestinal damage, and regulating intestinal microbiota abnormalities. It refer to KOPL could be a promising dietary strategy for treating obesity and improving its related metabolic diseases.																	0963-9969	1873-7145				OCT	2021	148								110456	10.1016/j.foodres.2021.110456							WOS:000697718700001

Krill oil usually contains a high concentration (about 50%) of phospholipids (AKOP) rich in DHA and EPA accompanied with 30%-40% triacylglycerols. Phospholipids can be made into liposomes without emulsifiers due to its amphiphilic characteristics. However, the absorption kinetics of AKOP liposome in vivo is not clear, which restrict the molecular mechanism analysis related to its distinct bioactivities. The lipid analysis in serum, small intestinal content and wall was carried out after oral administration of AKOP liposome to illustrate its absorption kinetics in blood and the digestive tract of healthy mice by single gavage. The major type of the obtained AKOP was phosphatidylcholine, and the total contents of the DHA and EPA were 29.31%. AKOP liposome was almost completely digested in the small intestine in 1 h and the hydrolysis products could be quickly absorbed by intestinal enterocytes. The DHA in serum peaked at 2 h after administration of AKOP liposome. AKOP liposome could be quickly digested and absorbed in vivo. The obtained results might provide a scientific basis for the molecular mechanism analysis related to distinct bioactivities of Antarctic krill oil phospholipid. (C) 2020 "Society information".

Four different pretreatment methods were used for the extraction of fluoride: double-deionised water extraction, sulphuric acid distillation, hydrochloric acid extraction, and pH adjustment with buffer after hydrochloric acid extraction. Four methods of comparative analysis revealed that sulphuric acid distillation was suitable preparation for ion chromatography determination of fluoride in Antarctic krill (fluoride content 288.7 +/- 10.2 mg/kg). The method was partially validated in linearity, accuracy, and precision. The linear range was from 0.1 to 10.0 mg/l with the regression coefficient of 0.99998. The accuracy expressed as the recoveries of standard addition ranged from 95.3% to 101.3%, the relative standard deviation (n = 8) was 1.8-1.9%. With this method, the 3 sigma limit of detection was 0.06 mg/l of fluoride in Antarctic krill. Our results indicate that the method (limit of quantification 0.2 mg/l) could be well applied for the determination of fluoride in Antarctic krill.

J	Newman, SJ; Ritz, D; Nicol, S				Newman, SJ; Ritz, D; Nicol, S			Behavioural reactions of Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba Dana) to ultraviolet and photosynthetically active radiation	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY												We used broad, shallow and deep, narrow aquarium tanks to examine the behavioural responses of Antarctic krill to photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) and ultraviolet (UV) radiation. Groups of animals were exposed to different levels of radiation and to gradients of radiation and their mean position in the tanks were recorded photographically. Results from the horizontal tank (length 2.4 m) showed that krill moved from areas of high levels (7 W m(-2)) of UVA exposure (320-400 nm) to areas of low exposure (0.1 W m(-2)), differing in irradiance by two orders of magnitude. In addition, a similar reaction was observed in krill exposed to a PAR gradient of similar magnitude (30-5 W m(-2)). There was no observed reaction to UVB wavelengths (280-320 nm). Krill in the vertical tank (height 1.5 m) remained evenly distributed throughout the tank when exposed to both high and low levels of PAR. Additional exposure to UVA wavelengths from the surface caused krill to increase their depth in the tank significantly, to areas of lower irradiance. Addition of UVB radiation had no effect on the mean depth of krill in the tank. The implications of these findings are that krill may avoid regions of high UVA or PAR and consequently would reduce their exposure to UVB and therefore the risk of UVB-induced damage, such as disruption to DNA.

Sympatry and resource partitioning between the largest krill consumers around the Antarctic Peninsula	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												Understanding how closely related, sympatric species distribute themselves relative to their environment is critical to understanding ecosystem structure and function and predicting effects of environmental variation. The Antarctic Peninsula supports high densities of krill and krill consumers; however, the region is warming rapidly, with unknown consequences. Humpback whales Megaptera novaeangliae and Antarctic minke whales Balaenoptera bonaerensis are the largest krill consumers here, yet key data gaps remain about their distribution, behavior, and interactions and how these will be impacted by changing conditions. Using satellite telemetry and novel spatial point-process modeling techniques, we quantified habitat use of each species relative to dynamic environmental variables and determined overlap in core habitat areas during summer months when sea ice is at a minimum. We found that humpback whales ranged broadly over continental shelf waters, utilizing nearshore bays, while minke whales restricted their movements to sheltered bays and areas where ice is present. This presents a scenario where minke whale core habitat overlaps substantially with the broader home ranges of humpback whales. While there is no indication that prey is limiting in this ecosystem, increased overlap between these species may arise as climate-driven changes that affect the extent, timing, and duration of seasonal sea ice decrease the amount of preferred foraging habitat for minke whales while concurrently increasing it for humpback whales. Our results provide the first quantitative assessment of behaviorally based habitat use and sympatry between these 2 krill consumers and offers insight into the potential effects of a rapidly changing environment on the structure and function of a polar ecosystem.

The results showed that the molecular weight range of antimicrobial polypeptide (CMCC-1) obtained by cation exchange chromatography was between 245-709D as detected by molecular sieve chromatography, and the minimum inhibition concentration (MIC) of CMCC-1 against Staphylococcus aureus was 5.0 mg mL(-1). The antimicrobial mechanism of CMCC-1 was studied with S. aureus as indicator bacterium. Compared with control group, the results of the experimental group in which S. aureus was treated with CMCC-1 were as follows: 1) CMCC-1 could inhibit cell division at logarithmic phase. 2) The protein and reducing sugar content, and the conductivity of culture medium increased, and the activity of alkaline phosphatase and beta-galactosidase could be detected in the culture medium. 3) Observation under scanning electron microscope revealed that somatic morphology became irregular, and then somatic surface became coarse. The cell became much smaller, and most somatic cells gathered. The boundary between cells became dim and finally fused as a whole. 4) Observation under transmission electron microscope showed that the surface of S. aureus became rough and the reproducing ability was restrained. The cell wall became thin and the cytoplasm shrunk. Substances inside cell leaked out, which caused cells death. 5) SDS-PAGE analysis showed that some bands disappeared, and the residual bands became vague. 6) The genomic DNA electrophoresis results showed that the genomic DNA bands of S. aureus were not degraded but the brightness significantly reduced. Thus, it is supposed that CMCC-1 could destroy the cell wall and membrane of S. aureu, increase the cell membrane permeability and the leaking-out of intracellular substances, and thus cause the death of S. aureu.																	1672-5182	1993-5021				SEP	2013	12	3					484	490		10.1007/s11802-013-2180-2							WOS:000322258300021

The systematic variations of TS vs. the incident angle of the ensonified wave, henceforth called TS-pattems, were successfully measured for 12 live Antarctic krill. These measurements were compared with the theoretical TS-pattems predicted by the Distorted-Wave Born Approximation-based deformed-cylinder model (DWBA model). While there was good agreement near the main lobe, the measurements were higher than the model predictions in the sidelobe regions; this is consistent with the observations of others. Several possible causes of this discrepancy such as the bending of abdomen and scattering from pleopods were examined, but no single factor was identified as the cause. Rather, it is likely that the discrepancy is a result of a combination of several factors. (c) 2005 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Visual inspection of freshly caught and captive animals suggests that their appendages, particularly the antennae and antennules, are often subject to injury. We have developed a novel method for reducing physical damage to captive krill based on their reported reaction to feeding whales. This method involves creating a bubble curtain that keeps the krill in the centre of the tank and away from potentially damaging hard surfaces. There was no difference in the length of the antennae between any of the captive animals. Trends in the data suggest that the antennules of krill maintained in a 200 L bubble curtain tank and a1000 L holding tank, were longer and less variable in length, than for krill in a 200 L tank with no bubble curtain. Freshly caught krill from the field were found to have damage to both antennae and antennules. The implications of these findings for husbandry of krill and for behavioural studies in the laboratory are discussed.																	1023-6244					DEC	2003	36	4					285	293		10.1080/10236240310001614411							WOS:000187994400009

The distribution patterns of E. crystallorophias in TNB seem to be strictly correlated both to hydrological features such as the presence of polynyas, pack-ice zone and certain temperatures values. According to our data, E. crystallorophias spawned from early October to early January. For the two age groups (0+ and 1+) an average growth rate of 0.074 and 0.076 mm/day was found, respectively. The mean biomass of larval E. crystallorophias (from Metanauplius to Furcilia I) in January was estimated as 84 mg WW/m(2).

Antarctic krill population genomics: apparent panmixia, but genome complexity and large population size muddy the water	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY												Antarctic krill (Euphausiasuperba; hereafter krill) are an incredibly abundant pelagic crustacean which has a wide, but patchy, distribution in the Southern Ocean. Several studies have examined the potential for population genetic structuring in krill, but DNA-based analyses have focused on a limited number of markers and have covered only part of their circum-Antarctic range. We used mitochondrial DNA and restriction site-associated DNA sequencing (RAD-seq) to investigate genetic differences between krill from five sites, including two from East Antarctica. Our mtDNA results show no discernible genetic structuring between sites separated by thousands of kilometres, which is consistent with previous studies. Using standard RAD-seq methodology, we obtained over a billion sequences from >140krill, and thousands of variable nucleotides were identified at hundreds of loci. However, downstream analysis found that markers with sufficient coverage were primarily from multicopy genomic regions. Careful examination of these data highlights the complexity of the RAD-seq approach in organisms with very large genomes. To characterize the multicopy markers, we recorded sequence counts from variable nucleotide sites rather than the derived genotypes; we also examined a small number of manually curated genotypes. Although these analyses effectively fingerprinted individuals, and uncovered a minor laboratory batch effect, no population structuring was observed. Overall, our results are consistent with panmixia of krill throughout their distribution. This result may indicate ongoing gene flow. However, krill's enormous population size creates substantial panmictic inertia, so genetic differentiation may not occur on an ecologically relevant timescale even if demographically separate populations exist.

Using ultrafiltration and chromatography methods, fifteen antioxidant peptides were purified from EPAH and identified as Asn-Gln-Met (NQM), Trp-Phe-Pro-Met (WFPM), Gln-Asn-Pro-Thr (QNPT), Tyr-Met-Asn-Phe (YMNF), Ser-Gly-Pro-Ala (SGPA), Ser-Leu-Pro-Tyr (SLPY), Gln-Tyr-Pro-Pro-Met-Gln-Tyr (QYPPMQY), Glu-Tyr-Glu-Ala (EYEA), Asn-Trp-Asp-Asp-Met-Arg-Ile-Val-Ala-Val (NWDDMRIVAV), Trp-Asp-Asp-Met-Glu-Arg-Leu-Val-Met-Ile (WDDMERLVMI), Asn-Trp-Asp-Asp-Met-Glu-Pro-Ser-Phe (NWD-DMEPSF), Asn-Gly-Pro-Asp-Pro-Arg-Pro-Ser-Gln-Gln (NGPDPRPSQQ), Ala-Phe-Leu-Trp-Asn (AFLWA), Asn-Val-Pro-Asp-Met (NVPDM), and Thr-Phe-Pro-Ile-Tyr-Asp-Tyr-Pro-Gln (TFPIYDPQ), respectively, using a protein sequencer and ESI/MS. Among fifteen antioxidant peptides, SLPY, QYPPMQY and EYEA showed the highest scavenging activities on DPPH center dot (EC50 values of 1.18 +/- 0.036, 1.547 +/- 0.150, and 1.372 +/- 0.274 mg/mL, respectively), HO center dot (EC50 values of 0.826 +/- 0.027, 1.022 +/- 0.058, and 0.946 +/- 0.011 mg/mL, respectively), and superoxide anion radical (EC50 values of 0.789 +/- 0.079, 0.913 +/- 0.007, and 0.793 +/- 0.056 mg/mL, respectively). Moreover, SLPY, QYPPMQY and EYEA showed strong reducing power, protective capability against H2O2-damaged plasmid DNA, and lipid peroxidation inhibition ability. Furthermore, SLPY, QYPPMQY, and EYEA had high stability under temperatures lower than 80 degrees C, pH values ranged from 6-8, and simulated GI digestion for 180 min. The results showed that fifteen antioxidant peptides from alcalase hydrolysate of Antarctic krill proteins, especially SLPY, QYPPMQY and EYEA, might serve as effective antioxidant agents applied in food and health products.																		1660-3397				JUN	2021	19	6							347	10.3390/md19060347							WOS:000666752800001	34204535

The extrudates were hard and porous agglomerates. The pellets still showed intact structure without obvious disintegration in response to hexane extraction. The oil recovery rates for raw krill meal and the extrudate of single krill meal were 55.08% and 59.08%, respectively. For extrudates, oil recovery rate increased along with the increasing additive amount of starches, with a maximum of 83.13%. Oil extracted from raw krill meal contained 49.30% of triglycerides (TG), 44.16% of phospholipids (PL), 1.45% of free fatty acids (FFA) and 4.69% of cholesterols (CHO). Meanwhile, polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) and saturated fatty acids (SFA) account for 20.89%, 37.84% and 41.27% of the total fatty acids, respectively. By contrast, oils extracted from extrudates contained more TG but less PL and more SFA but less PUFA.

The hydrolysates contained 0.951 g/100 ml amino acid nitrogen, which was sufficient to meet the special grade requirements of soy sauce according to the Chinese National Standard. Meanwhile, the recovery of total nitrogen was 75.33%. The second-stage autolysis exhibited a great positive effect on the improvement of nitrogen recovery. The optimal conditions for obtaining the highest amino acid nitrogen level during the second-stage autolysis were hydrolysate/krill ratio of 2.23, initial pH of 7.23, 40.94 degrees C, which were determined by response surface methodology. The dominant compositions of krill protein hydrolysates were peptides. Proline, glutamate, aspartate, glycine and valine were the dominant amino acids in the hydrolysates, accounting for 15.18, 14.03, 12.14, 10.78 and 10.16 mg/ml, respectively. The hydrolysates prepared by two-stage autolysis had high amino acid nitrogen level and high recovery of total nitrogen, which could be used in the preparation of high quality krill sauce.

J	Reid, K; Murphy, EJ; Loeb, V; Hewitt, RP				Reid, K; Murphy, EJ; Loeb, V; Hewitt, RP			Krill population dynamics in the Scotia Sea: variability in growth and mortality within a single population	JOURNAL OF MARINE SYSTEMS												Understanding the demographics of Antarctic krill over large scales may be complicated by regional differences in the processes that govern population structure. The influence of regional differences in growth and mortality on population size structure was examined using data on the length-frequency distribution of krill in the Scotia Sea using samples from the South Shetland Islands and South Georgia collected annually from 1991 to 2000. A correction function, which took account of the higher growth rate at South Georgia, produced a consistent similarity in the position of the modal size classes that was not present in the raw data. Optimising the mortality rate, to minimise the differences in the growth corrected length-frequency distribution, suggested a higher mortality rate at South Georgia that the South Shetlands. The intra-specific variations in growth and mortality rates are consistent with published values and with other Euphausiids species. Having accounted for the demographic plasticity, it is apparent that strong recruitment of the smallest size class of krill is represented in both populations simultaneously. It appears that first-year krill are advected into different regions of the Scotia Sea where the resultant population size structure is determined by regional differences in growth and mortality. The majority of the commercial harvest of krill in the Antarctic occurs in a relatively small number of regional fisheries within the Scotia Sea and is managed using population models based on a single set of demographic parameters. Where substantial differences in these parameters exist between fishing areas, the calculation of catch limits should take these differences into account. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Life under Antarctic Pack Ice: A Krill Perspective	SMITHSONIAN AT THE POLES: CONTRIBUTIONS TO INTERNATIONAL POLAR YEAR SCIENCE: A SMITHSONIAN CONTRIBUTION TO KNOWLEDGE					Smithsonian Poles Symposium 2007	MAY 03-04, 2007	Smithsonian Inst, Washington, DC		Smithsonian Inst			The life cycle of the Antarctic krill, Euphausia superba, intersects in space and time with the expansion and contraction of annual pack ice. Consequently, the circumpolar distribution of krill has often been defined as generally limited to an area bounded by the maximum extent of pack ice. Pack ice has both direct and indirect effects on the life cycle of krill. During the austral winter, larval krill are found in direct association with the underside of the ice and feed on the small plants and animals that constitute the sea ice microbial community, a food source relatively abundant in winter compared to food sources in the water column. Indirectly, melting pack ice in late winter or early spring stabilizes the water column and promotes growth of the preferred food of krill, which, in turn, likely provides the fuel for egg production during the summer months. Thus, the warming trend west of the Antarctic Peninsula with attendant changes in both the timing and duration of winter ice has implications for the population dynamics of krill. Given the complexity of the habitat-life cycle interaction, research on Antarctic krill involves diverse sampling tools that are dependent on the size and habitat of krill during a particular stage of their life cycle, and the nature of the study itself. In particular, and pertinent to the topic of diving in polar research, the research has been greatly enhanced by diving techniques developed to allow both observation and sampling of krill in their winter pack-ice habitat.																			978-0-9788460-1-5				2009							285	298		10.5479/si.097884601X.21							WOS:000264705700021

Three-dimensional observations of swarms of Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) made using a multi-beam echosounder	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY												Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) aggregate in dense swarms. Previous investigations of krill swarms have used conventional single- or split-beam echosounders that, with post-processing, provide a two-dimensional (2-D) view of the water column, leaving the third dimension to be inferred. We used a multi-beam echosounder system (SM20, 200 kHz, Kongsberg Mesotech Ltd, Canada) from an inflatable boat (length = 5.5 m) to sample water-column backscatter, particularly krill swarms, directly in 2-D and, with post-processing, to provide a three dimensional (3-D) view of entire krill swarms. The study took place over six days (2-8 February 2006) in the vicinity of Livingston Island, South Shetland Islands, Antarctica (62.4 degrees S, 60.7 degrees W). An automatic 3-D aggregation detection algorithm resolved 1006 krill swarms from the survey data. Principal component analyses indicated that swarm morphology metrics such as length, surface area and volume accounted for the largest between swarm variance, followed by echo energy, and finally swarm geographic location. Swarms did not form basic cylindrical or spherical shapes, but had quite consistent surface area to volume ratios of 3.3 m(-1). Swarms were spatially segregated, with larger sizes (mean north-south length = 276 m, at least double that of two other swarm classifications), found to the northwest of the survey area. The apparent clustering of swarm types suggests that krill biomass surveys and ecosystem investigations may require stratified survey design, in response to varying 3-D swarm morphology, variation that may be driven in turn by environmental characteristics such as bathymetry.

J	Taki, K				Taki, Kenji			Seasonal and interannual variations in abundance of Euphausia pacifica off north-eastern Japan	FISHERIES SCIENCE												Seasonal and interannual variations in abundance of Euphausia pacifica off north-eastern Japan were examined using Remodeled Norpac net samples collected from April 1993 to February 2000. Spawning occurred mainly during April-June and August-October in every year. When abundance of eggs was high in May, those of larval and immature stages in May-June and small adults (<= 15 mm) during July-October tended to be high. There were high positive correlations between monthly average abundance of eggs in May-June and average abundance of small adults during July-October. However, there was low or negative correlation between monthly abundance of eggs in April and average abundance of small adults during July-October. Recruitment time to adult takes approximately 3 months, so these results suggest that small adults during July-October are mainly derived from spawning in May-June, but rarely from spawning in April. The apparent decrease in abundance of small adults from summer to winter was observed every year despite active spawning during August-October, which would recruit to adults in late autumn-winter. The possible effects on recruitment and mortality are discussed in relation to starvation and predation caused by low temperatures and low available food abundance.																	0919-9268					OCT	2007	73	5					1094	1103		10.1111/j.1444-2906.2007.01441.x							WOS:000249991500018

These were combined with net and acoustically derived abundance and biomass data to estimate the in situ grazing of Euphausia superba on the phytoplankton assemblages. Individual ingestion rates of krill were 1.5 to 3 times higher than rates previously obtained with in vitro incubations. Gut pigment levels and evacuation rates varied in the range of 0.01 to 10 mu g chlorophyll a equivalents (chi a equiv.) ind(-1) and 0.10 to 0.31 h(-1), respectively. Pigment losses to non-fluorescing products during digestion were very high, in the range of 67 to 90% of the total pigment ingested, indicating that some of the gut pigment levels previously obtained without correction for digestive losses may have been underestimated by up to an order of magnitude. Krill population impact on the phytoplankton stock exhibited a large variability, in the range of 0.0014 to 2.68% of total integrated chlorophyll a and 0.023 to 50.8% of primary production consumed per day. The largest variations in impact levels were associated with the method used to estimate krill abundance and biomass, with net derived estimates being much lower (by as much as 2 orders of magnitude) than those obtained from acoustic data. Daily carbon rations obtained from our measurements of pigment ingestion rates are among the lowest recorded for E. superba during the summer season and, with 1 exception, ranged between 0.15 and 1.68% of body carbon per day. A daily ration of similar to 13% body carbon was recorded only at 1 station in the MIZ which exhibited a dense phytoplankton bloom of similar to 3.5 pg chi I-1. On the basis of the energetic requirements of the summer krill population, it is suggested that throughout the PFZ and the MIZ E. superba must consume a much larger proportion of heterotrophic carbon than previously supposed. Gut content analysis suggests that this is achieved by predation on meso- and microzooplankton.

J	Amo, L; Rodriguez-Girones, MA; Barbosa, A				Amo, Luisa; Angel Rodriguez-Girones, Miguel; Barbosa, Andres			Olfactory detection of dimethyl sulphide in a krill-eating Antarctic penguin	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												In response to zooplankton grazing, phytoplankton release dimethylsulphoniopropionate in the seawater, which is then catabolized to dimethyl sulphide (DMS) that is emitted to the air. This molecule therefore signals areas of high productivity in the oceans, and it can be used by predators for locating foraging areas. Detection of this compound has been described in several species of procelariiform seabirds and non-Antarctic fish-feeding penguins. However, there is no evidence of DMS detection by krill-feeding penguins. The mechanisms of krill detection by its predators are especially relevant in Antarctica, where trophic webs are mainly based on krill. We explored for the first time whether a krill-feeding penguin species, the chinstrap penguin Pygoscelis antarctica, is able to detect DMS. We examined whether chinstrap penguins could detect DMS by locating DMS or control recipients in pathways that penguins used when moving between the colony and the sea. We also analysed the attraction of nestling penguins to DMS in a T-shaped experimental enclosure. Our results showed that adult penguins are attracted to DMS on land. Nestling penguins also tended to be attracted to the scent of DMS. Further research is needed to examine whether chinstrap penguins use natural DMS concentrations as a foraging cue at sea.

Purified AM was obtained on a large scale from crude extract extracted from Antarctic krill in 38.14 % yield by silica gel column chromatography. After the AM was saponified with methanolic KOH (0.10 mol L-1) and separated by high-performance thin-layer chromatography, pure astaxanthin was obtained. There was only one optical (3R, 3'R)-isomer of the esterification of astaxanthin with (-)-camphanic acid chloride detected by high-performance liquid chromatography compared with astaxanthin standard. It was further proved that the AM consists of only one optical (3R, 3'R)-isomer. Twelve types of fatty acids in the AM from Antarctic krill were found by gas chromatography-mass spectrometer. Eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic acids are the major fatty acids. It is the first time to prepare (3R, 3'R)-AM and (3R, 3'R)-astaxanthin from Antarctic krill.

At present, the research about Antarctic krill phospholipid (KOPL) mainly focuses on the purification, and there are few reports on the anti-obesity effect. Thus, this study aimed at evaluating the effect of KOPL on the high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity mice. All the mice were divided into five groups, which were fed chow diet, HFD, and different doses of KOPL + HFD, respectively. The results showed that KOPL treatment could reduce the weight gain, fat accumulation, and liver tissue damage in HFD-induced mice. KOPL treatment could reduce the levels of serum lipid (TC, TG, L-LDL) and fasting blood glucose in HFD-induced mice, and the inflammatory cytokines (IL-113 and TNF-alpha) in serum. Further analysis showed that KOPL could promote the normal expression of lipid-synthesis-related genes and proteins, including sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c), fatty acid synthetase (FAS), and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPAR-alpha) in liver tissue. Besides, it inhibited the overexpression of inflammatory cytokine genes (IL-113 and TNF-alpha), but increased the expression of tight junction genes (ZO-1 and Occludin) in the colon tissue. Additionally, KOPL improved the decrease of diversity and imbalance of intestinal microbiota, which could contribute to its beneficial effects. In summary, the KOPL treatment improves the effects of HFD-induced obese mice by maintaining normal lipid levels, protecting the liver tissue, reducing inflammation response and intestinal damage, and regulating intestinal microbiota abnormalities. It refer to KOPL could be a promising dietary strategy for treating obesity and improving its related metabolic diseases.																	0963-9969	1873-7145				OCT	2021	148								110456	10.1016/j.foodres.2021.110456							WOS:000702834800012

This can have a flow-on effect, providing increased food availability for higher trophic level species. Using data from a 5-day combined visual and acoustic survey, we examined the hypothesis that higher Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) density provides a lucrative resource for humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) at a remote Antarctic feeding area, the Balleny Islands (67(o)S, 164 degrees E). We assessed whale presence at the feeding area in relation to prey (krill), productivity and environmental variables using density surface modeling. We found stark differences between krill swarms near the islands and those in adjacent open water. Swarms were twice as dense and three times more numerous near the Balleny Islands compared to an open water pelagic environment, suggesting that the islands offered a profitable feeding opportunity. At the feeding area, whales were found in deeper and more productive waters with medium krill densities.

The hydrogen bonds of SA/AKP composite material were analyzed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy(FTIR), the effects of salt concentration on the crystallinity, fluidity and morphology of the composite material were studied by XRD, rheometer and SEM. Experiment manifested the existence of intramolecular and intermolecular hydrogen bonds in SA/AKP system. The strength of intermolecular hydrogen bonds was enhanced with the increase of NaCl in the composite material. At the same time, the increase of salt concentration led to SA/AKP composite material' s crystallinity increasing, the rheological properties decreasing at first and then increasing, and mechanical properties increasing at first and then decreasing. SA/AKP fiber SEM images showed that crystallized salt was separated from the fiber, and the surface structure of the composite fiber gradually decreased and became denser and smoother. Finally, AKP was completely oriented in the SA/AKP composite system.																	0251-0790					SEP 10	2017	38	9					1701	1708		10.7503/cjcu20170015							WOS:000410680800029

Results showed that AKO improved the cartilage structure, inhibited chondrocyte hypertrophic differentiation and inhibited abnormal apoptosis in articular cartilage. Autophagy is a self-protective metabolic process required for maintaining cartilage homeostasis. We observed that expression of mTOR were reduced, which was consist with high PPAR-gamma levels. The expression of key genes related to autophagy, including LC-3B, Beclin-1, ATG-5; and BNIP-3 were significantly enhanced after treatment with AKO. In addition, we observed that AKO suppressed the expression of key genes in p53-dependent mitochondrial apoptotic pathway, such as p53, Bax, Bid, cytochrome c, caspase-9, caspase-3 and enhanced the expression of anti-apoptotic genes, including Bcl-2 and Bcl-xl. These findings provided a new perspective for the effect of AKO on OA, which associated with the regulation of autophagy and apoptosis.

Data were obtained relating to spawning depth and to extents to which larval stages co-occur and vary in depth through the season. Reproductive adults occurred at all depths sampled in late December in Bransfield Strait and in all but one stratum in late January to a depth of 2000 m in Drake Passage. Mature males were caught together with gravid females and freely sinking eggs down to at least 1000 m in Drake Passage and to more than 500 m in Bransfield Strait, providing indirect evidence that spawning can take place over extensive ranges of depth. In the 300-400 m deep Gerlache Strait, where larvae were particularly numerous (January to March), only a few reproductive adults were caught, and only in December at 100-200 m. Sampling methods were clearly inappropriate for quantitative estimates of adults.

J	Reid, K; Watkins, JL; Croxall, JP; Murphy, EJ				Reid, K; Watkins, JL; Croxall, JP; Murphy, EJ			Krill population dynamics at South Georgia 1991-1997, based on data from predators and nets	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												Central to understanding krill population dynamics is knowledge of their population structure. To examine this we used length-frequency distributions from 142 wk of sampling (n = 23996 krill) of 3 predator species breeding at South Georgia and 12 wk of sampling (n = 10252 krill) from scientific nets from the same area over the summers of 1991-1997. In comparing the 5 years for which both predator and net samples were available, despite differing selectivities and spatio-temporal circumscriptions, both predators and nets were sampling the same overall krill population. Greatest similarity resulted from comparing net samples with samples from Antarctic fur seals and macaroni penguins combined; least temporal variation occurred in predator samples from late summer (March). From the 7 yr predator time series, within-year variation was greatest in 1991 and 1994, both years of low krill biomass at South Georgia. In both of these years large krill dominated during December but were completely replaced by small krill by February. The mean length of the March krill population showed a regular increase from 1991 to 1993, fell to a minimum in 1994 and thereafter increased steadily to 1997. Using these data in conjunction with putative size/age-group cohorts in the length-frequency distribution. we suggest that years of high mean krill length reflect failure of small krill to recruit into the population, producing a period of low krill biomass in the following year. Similar recruitment failure in the same years was evident in krill populations in the Antarctic Peninsula region to the south, indicating large-scale events. This supports suggestions of periodic fluctuations in krill production and recruitment which may relate directly to physical phenomena such as cycles in the distribution and extent of sea ice.																	0171-8630						1999	177						103	114		10.3354/meps177103							WOS:000079215300010

The objective of this study was to investigate the stability of krill powder when stored for up to 12 months at room temperature. In addition, the effect of packaging in vacuum was observed. The stability was assessed by changes in concentrations of lipid classes, antioxidants, pyrroles and lipid, and Strecker-derived volatiles. Some degradation occurred during storage at room temperature. Thus, a minor increase in volatiles, an increase in free fatty acids and a concomitant decrease in antioxidants, tocopherol, and astaxanthin was observed. In addition, there was a minor decrease in phospholipids and n-3 fatty acids; however, storage at vacuum improved the oxidative stability of krill powder. Practical applications: For the use of krill powder in human nutrition, it is important, that the quality and stability is sufficiently high to retain the nutritional value during storage. This study contributes with information about the stability during storage up to 12 months at room temperature and the effect of packaging the powder in vacuum.

Most species of krill are open ocean animals, which makes direct observation and sampling difficult. Krill also exhibit a number of physiological and behavioural attributes which frustrate attempts to understand their life history. Krill are conceptually difficult to come to terms with; they are obviously different from larger marine organisms such as squid, fish, whales and fish yet they are also quite distinct from those animals classed as zooplankton such as copepods. Despite these differences they have most often been grouped with zooplankton and have been studied using techniques developed for animals which are orders of magnitude smaller than they. This mismatch has affected our view of their interactions with the physical world and also affects their perceived trophic interactions. Their size and mobility also interferes with our ability to sample them effectively and thus to develop our appreciation of their true role in the marine ecosystem. Understanding how intermediate-sized animals, such as krill, function in aquatic ecosystem is critical to better management of the marine environment.																	1023-6244	1029-0362				DEC	2003	36	4					191	205		10.1080/10236240310001614420							WOS:000187994400003

In this study, the use of high-intensity ultrasound for the preparation of low oil emulsion gel (oil fraction of 0.25) was investigated. Specifically, defatted Antarctic krill protein (dAKP) was used to stabilize the interface of soybean oil and water. Then, the microstructure and the stabilization mechanism of the formed emulsion gel were evaluated by cryoSEM, CLSM, zeta potential, rheological measurements, and FTIR. Besides, the particle diameter was measured to be around 5 mu m. The results of CLSM indicated that the emulsion gel was the oil-in-water type. The emulsion gel exhibited gel-like viscoelastic behavior even at a low concentration of dAKP due to the formation of a rigid particle network while the rheological behavior of the emulsion gel was significantly affected by the concentration of dAKP. The stabilization of the emulsion gel can be maintained by space steric hindrance and hydrophobic interactions between particles in the emulsion gel system.																	1350-4177	1873-2828				JAN	2021	70								105294	10.1016/j.ultsonch.2020.105294							WOS:000595254400004	32759019

Here, we investigated the anti-inflammatory and antioxidative effects of krill oil. Oil from Euphausia superba (Antarctic krill), an Antarctic marine species, is rich in eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). We examined whether krill oil diet (80 mg/kg/day for one month) prevents amyloidogenesis and cognitive impairment induced by intraperitoneal lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (250 mu g/kg, seven times daily) injections in AD mice model and found that krill oil treatment inhibited the LPS-induced memory loss. We also found that krill oil treatment inhibited the LPS-induced expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and decreased reactive oxygen species (ROS) and malondialdehyde levels. Krill oil also suppresses I kappa B degradation as well as p50 and p65 translocation into the nuclei of LPS-injected mice brain cells. In association with the inhibitory effect on neuroinflammation and oxidative stress, krill oil suppressed amyloid beta (1-42) peptide generation by the down-regulating APP and BACE1 expression in vivo. We found that eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) (50 and 100 mu M) dose-dependently decreased LPS-induced nitric oxide and ROS generation, and COX-2 and iNOS expression as well as nuclear factor-kappa B activity in cultured microglial BV-2 cells. These results suggest that krill oil ameliorated impairment via anti-inflammatory, antioxidative, and anti-amyloidogenic mechanisms.

Behaviour affects local-scale distributions of Antarctic krill around South Georgia	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												Antarctic krill Euphausia superba are key to most Antarctic ecosystems, particularly at South Georgia, where penguins and seals rely on them for their breeding success each summer. Changes in krill behaviour and local-scale distribution during this time can have large consequences for these predators; however, we currently have little understanding of the behaviour of Antarctic krill in response to changing conditions of predation and food. We used a stochastic dynamic programming model to investigate the behaviour of krill within a region close to South Georgia that is known to be heavily foraged by penguins and seals. In the model, krill responded to changing conditions by adjusting their depth, density of swarm and swimming behaviour. We have shown the optimal behaviour of krill in 3 biologically distinct regions: the on-shelf region, shelf-break region and off-shelf region. We predict significantly higher concentrations of krill will result at the shelf-break region from krill choosing to swim slower and turn more often in a favourable zone. In addition, we predict a diel pattern in swarm density in most conditions of the model, with small krill generally forming lower density swarms than large krill, particularly on-shelf. This work is the first prediction of the effects of krill swarming and swimming behaviour on local-scale distribution.

The fishery has seen changes in the nations involved, with early catches dominated by vessels from the USSR, Japanese vessels in the middle years and, more recently, most of the catch has been taken by vessels from Norway. A variety of products have emerged from the fishery with early efforts aimed at human consumption but latterly, the bulk of the catch has been used as high-end aquaculture feed with a small but valuable fraction being used to produce krill oil. The fishery has been managed by the international Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources which recognised the potential threat to the marine ecosystem through krill harvesting and which has implemented a precautionary approach to management of the fishery. Currently the fishery catches approximately 300,000 tonnes annually, all from the South Atlantic, where the precautionary catch limit has been set at 5.6 million tonnes. The fishery and its management regime will face challenges in the future with the emergence of new technologies, increased catches by new entrants and environmental changes.																	2468-5712		978-3-319-29279-3; 978-3-319-29277-9				2016							387	421		10.1007/978-3-319-29279-3_11	10.1007/978-3-319-29279-3						WOS:000401843300012						
J	Cresswell, KA; Wiedenmann, JR; Mangel, M				Cresswell, Katherine A.; Wiedenmann, John R.; Mangel, Marc			A model of parental conflict: Predicting provisioning behavior of penguin partners in response to local changes in krill	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING												Understanding direct influences of local prey availability on penguin breeding behavior is limited in part because it is extremely challenging to organize a study that collects detailed data for both simultaneously. Models can help us understand the pattern of interaction between penguins and their prey, bridging holes in the data and helping steer future empirical studies. The main goal of our work is to provide an estimate of the functional response for penguins with respect to local changes in Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) around breeding colonies in the Southern Ocean. We use data from field studies on penguins and krill to characterize a state-dependent life-history model where a breeding pair of penguins forage to provision a chick to fledging. Each parent makes decisions that maximize a measure of reproductive success based on quantified estimates for state dynamics, using a probabilistic distribution of how their partner is behaving (determined by successive runs of the model). We predict that the relationships describing total amount of krill eaten and chick survival versus krill available around a breeding colony approximate a Holling Type III functional response. We also found that quantifying the quality of the prey environment, rather than total quantity was a useful and relatively simple way to test changes in krill availability. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

In order to investigate this, we analysed data on krill-eating predators at South Georgia from 1980 to 2000. Indices of population size and reproductive performance showed declines in all species and an increase in the frequency of years of low reproductive output. Changes in the population structure of krill and its relationship with reproductive performance suggested that the biomass of krill within the largest size class was sufficient to support predator demand in the 1980s but not in the 1990s. We suggest that the effects of underlying changes in the system on the krill population structure have been amplified by predator-induced mortality, resulting in breeding predators now regularly operating close to the limit of krill availability. Understanding how krill demography is affected by changes in physical environmental factors and by predator consumption and how, in turn, this influences predator performance and survival, is one of the keys to predicting future change in Antarctic marine ecosystems.																	0962-8452					FEB 22	2001	268	1465					377	384		10.1098/rspb.2000.1371							WOS:000167214000007	11270434

In the population, from the Gullmarsfjord (west coast of Sweden), LDH was encoded for by two different Ldh-A* and -B* loci. The isoenzymes were named according to their electrophoretic mobilities. Ldh-A* locus was polymorphic. The allelic frequencies were a = 0.99, a' = 0.002, a'' = 0.004, a''' = 0.004. The level of LDH polymorphism is low. Most individuals possess the same amount of two LDH homopolymers (LDH-A*(4) and LDH-B*(4)). The Meganyctiphanes norvegica LDH-A*(4) and LDH-B*(4) isoenzymes and the predominant LDH-A*(4) isoenzyme from Euphausia superba were purified to specific activities of 294, 306 and 464 mu mol NADH min(-1) mg(-1), respectively. In both species the LDH isoenzymes were separated by chromatofocusing. All three isoenzymes are L-specific tetramers with molecular weight of approximately 160 kDa. Northern krill LDH-A*(4) has higher affinity for pyruvate and lactate and is more thermostable than LDH-B*(4). Both isoenzymes are inhibited significantly by high concentration of pyruvate but not lactate. Antarctic krill isoenzyme exhibits high substrate affinities, high NAD inhibition, high inhibition at 10 mM pyruvate, lack of lactate inhibition, and high heat stability and resembles northern krill LDH-A*(4) isoenzyme.

We compared the muscle tissue of juvenile, adult and shrunken adult krill to identify changes in cell number associated with maturity and shrinkage. Comparison of the absolute number and density of nuclei in abdominal segments of juvenile, adult and shrunken adult krill revealed differences related to maturity and shrinkage. Shrunken adult krill had nearly twice as many nuclei per unit area than adult krill that had not shrunk. This suggests that krill shrink by a reduction in cell volume, rather than cell loss. This simply detected variation in muscle cell nucleus density may be useful in distinguishing shrunken adult krill from juveniles, and contribute to our knowledge of age structure in natural populations.																	0722-4060					MAR	2002	25	3					180	186		10.1007/s003000100325							WOS:000174713200003

Krill fed a phytoplankton diet, in particular diatoms and cryptomonads, assimilated more lipids, dominated by triacylglycerol, than krill fed rotifers and Artemia. Krill fed different phytoplankton can be distinguished by their fatty acid profiles, e.g.: Diatoms: high EPA (20:5omega3) and 16:1omega7 Cryptomonads: high 18:omega9, 18:4w3 and 16:1omega7; Dinoflagellates: high DHA (22:6omega3) and 16:1omega7 Thraustochytrids: high DHA, 14:0 and 16:1omega7 Krill fed rotifers or Artemia can be distinguished from phytoplankton-fed krill but can not be distinguished from each other based on fatty acid profiles.

We observed a high biomass of zooplankton between 53.8degrees and 53.4degreesS associated with the inshore, northwestward flow of the Southern Antarctic Circumpolar Current Front (SACCF) that occurred in around 2500 m of water close to the base of the slope. There was very little zooplankton biomass present in the more offshore, eastward flowing waters where a second manifestation of the SACCF was also present on the section. The region of enhanced zooplankton biomass was over 50 km in horizontal extent with the highest densities (>10 g m(-3)) in the area of strongest flow (>35 cm s(-1)). The majority of the zooplankton present on the section was Antarctic krill and most of it occurred in the upper 100 m. The rate of physically mediated transport of Antarctic krill across the off-shelf sections (similar to10 km) of the transect showed marked variation, with highest rates (>10(6) g s(-1)) associated with the northwestward flow of the SACCF. Farther offshore, where the krill biomass and flow rates were much reduced, the flux of krill was very low. The integrated horizontal flux of krill across the offshore sections was large (192 x 10(3) t d(-1)) and to the northwest. A second occupation of the transect showed that the krill flux is highly variable, and we discuss the various physical and biological factors that will generate such variability. We show that horizontal flux of krill in ocean currents is a major factor in determining the abundance of krill around South Georgia.

J	Loeb, VJ; Santora, JA				Loeb, Valerie J.; Santora, Jarrod A.			Climate variability and spatiotemporal dynamics of five Southern Ocean krill species	PROGRESS IN OCEANOGRAPHY												Understanding the ecological response of marine organisms to future climate change will benefit from quantifying spatiotemporal aspects of their distribution and abundance as well as the influence of ocean-atmospheric climate modes on their population cycles. Our study provides a synthesis of 18 years of data (1992-2009) for 5 krill (euphausiid) species monitored near the North Antarctic Peninsula (NAP) during austral summer. Distribution and abundance data are presented for postlarval stages of Euphausia crystallorophias, E. frigida, E. superba, E. triacantha and Thysanoessa macrura and larval E. superba and T. macrura. Intraseasonal, interannual and longer-term distribution and abundance patterns are quantified relative to climate modes driving ecosystem variability off the Antarctic Peninsula: El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), Southern Annual Mode (SAM) and associated zonal and meridional winds. Interannual abundance variations of all 5 species are significantly correlated with seasonally averaged ENSO indices and, with the exception of E. triacantha, elevated population sizes are associated with the higher productivity La Nina phase. Time-lagged responses of each species to ENSO indices approximate their generation times and suggest evolution of their life histories and reproductive efforts in accordance with the ENSO cycle. Postlarval E. aystallorophias and E. frigida and larval T. macrura demonstrate significant abundance increases after 1998 associated with a shift from an El Nino dominated period to predominantly La Nina and "Nino-neutral" conditions. Seasonal changes in species distributions and co-occurrence indicate portions of the southernmost E. frigida, E. triacantha and T. macrura populations move poleward with E. superba during late-summer, suggesting that environmental conditions associated with sea ice development (e.g., food, retention) may be more favorable than within the Antarctic Circumpolar Current during low productivity seasons. Spatial distributions of larval and postlarval T. macrura suggest 2 separate spawning populations within oceanic and coastal waters. Lastly, mean euphausiid species concentrations and abundance relationships encountered during 1992-2009 are remarkably similar to those reported for the Antarctic Peninsula during the 1928-1935 Discovery Investigations. Circumpolar observations of E. superba "superswarms" associated with a major climatically related ecosystem change in the late 1970s may have represented an episodic period of anomalous peak abundance. Subsequent abundance estimates compared to these anomalies would indicate a significant decrease, but should not be taken to reflect the impact of climate warming. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The structure and composition of the AKP, including particle size, Zeta potential, molecular weight distribution, amino acid composition, microstructure and surface elemental composition, changed significantly after chelating with zinc. The result of Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy indicated that zinc could be chelated by carboxyl oxygen and amino nitrogen atoms of the AKP. Furthermore, compared with zinc sulfate and zinc gluconate, the AKP-Zn chelate was more stable at various pH conditions and the simulated gastrointestinal digestion experiment. These findings would provide a scientific basis for developing new zinc supplements and the high-value utilization of Antarctic krill protein resource.																	0308-8146	1873-7072				MAR 15	2021	340								128056	10.1016/j.foodchem.2020.128056							WOS:000593690000007	33032152

A dry ashing (DA) procedure with magnesium nitrate and two microwave (MW) acid assisted digestion methods (with HNO3/H2O2 and HNO3/HF) were tested for decomposing the certified reference material MURST-ISS-A2 (antarctic krill) for the subsequent determination of As and Se by HG-ICP-AES. Microwave procedures, namely MW1 and MW2, were insufficient to digest As and Se in this marine organism. The recoveries achieved were: 37.3% +/- 2.2% (MW1) and 30.9 +/- 1.6% (MW2) for As: 43.2 +/- 2.0% (MW1) and 41.61.8% (MW2) for Se. On the other hand, the results obtained using the dry ashing method at 500 degreesC were consistent with the reference values with recoveries around 100%. The optimum working conditions and the order of sample, NaBH4 and KI mixing during the simultaneous hydride generation of As and Se were studied. Under optimised conditions detection limits of As and Se ranged between 22 and 50 ng g(-1) for the three methods tested. In all cases precisions were better than 7%.																	0212-0569						2001	20	1					13	19									WOS:000168013800002

Spatial association between hotspots of baleen whales and demographic patterns of Antarctic krill Euphausia superba suggests size-dependent predation	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												We examined the spatial association between baleen whales and their principal prey, Antarctic krill Euphausia superba near the South Shetland Islands (Antarctic Peninsula) using data collected by the US Antarctic Marine Living Resources (AMLR) program during January surveys from 2003 through 2007. Whale distributions were determined using ship-based visual surveys, while data on krill distribution, abundance, and demographic characteristics were derived from net hauls. Approximately 25 000 km of transects and 500 net hauls were sampled over 5 yr. We defined hotspots based on statistical criteria to describe persistent areas of occurrence of both whales and krill. Hotspots were identified, and whales and krill length-maturity classes exhibited distinct spatial segregation in their distribution patterns. We found that baleen whales aggregated to krill hotspots that differed in size structure. Humpback whales Megaptera novaeangliae were associated with small (<35 mm) juvenile krill in Bransfield Strait, whereas fin whales Balaenoptera physalus were associated with large (>45 mm) mature krill located offshore. Overlapping these size-dependent krill distributions, Antarctic minke whales B. bonaerensis were associated with intermediate sized krill (35-44 mm). The correlation among different whale species and krill swarms of differing size composition presents an intriguing pattern that deserves further study.																	0171-8630	1616-1599					2010	405						255	269		10.3354/meps08513							WOS:000278041300019

Cephaloidophora pacifica was found at all stations around the Antarctic, with 96.4% of the euphausiids infected (n = 195). The numbers of C pacifica per krill ranged from 0 to 8089 krill(-1), and the average was 350.0 +/- 787.8 (mean +/- SD). The frequency distributions of C. pacifica showed an overdispersed parasite population (i.e. the variance was greater than the mean) at all locations. Statistical analysis showed that whilst the geographical location did not have a significant effect on intensity of C. pacifica the maturity stage of krill did, with an increasing intensity of infection as Krill matures. The infestation of E. superba by eugregarinid protozoan is considered to be a circum-Antarctic phenomenon, and it occurs equally throughout the Southern Ocean.

S.; Clark, Melody S.; Gaten, Edward; Rosato, Ezio			Effects of simulated light regimes on gene expression in Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba Dana)	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY												A change in photoperiod has been implicated in triggering a transition from an active to a quiescent state in Antarctic krill. We examined this process at the molecular level, to identify processes that are affected when passing a photoperiodic threshold. Antarctic krill captured in the austral autumn were divided into two groups and immediately incubated either under a photoperiod of 12 h light:12 h darkness (LID), simulating the natural light cycle, or in continuous darkness (DID), simulating winter. All other conditions were kept identical between incubations. After 7 days of adaptation, krill were sampled every 4h over a 24h period and frozen. Total RNA was extracted from the heads and pooled to construct a suppression subtractive hybridisation library. Differentially expressed sequences were identified and annotated into functional categories through database sequence matching. We found a difference in gene expression between LD and DD krill, with LID krill expressing more genes involved in functions such as metabolism, motor activity, protein binding and various other cellular activities. Eleven of these genes were examined further with quantitative polymerase chain reaction analyses, which revealed that expression levels were significantly higher in LD krill. The genes affected by simulated photoperiodic change are consistent with known features of quiescence, such as a slowing of moult rate, a lowering of activity levels and a reduction in metabolic rate. The expression of proteases involved in apolysis, where the old cuticle separates from the epidermis, showed particular sensitivity to photoperiod and point to the mechanism by which moult rate is adjusted seasonally. Our results show that key processes are already responding at the molecular level after just 7 days of exposure to a changed photoperiodic cycle. We propose that krill switch rapidly between active and quiescent states and that the photoperiodic cycle plays a key role in this process. Crown Copyright (C) 2009 Published by Elsevier B.V.

J	Hill, SL				Hill, Simeon L.			From strategic ambiguity to technical reference points in the Antarctic krill fishery: the worst journey in the world?	ENVIRONMENTAL CONSERVATION												The goals of ecosystem based management (EBM) are strategically ambiguous, meaning that they require interpretation to identify objectives for ecosystem state. Ecosystem states that are useful for achieving such objectives are known as reference points. Soft reference points specify both a state and a probability of the ecosystem being in that state. They are used with simulation models to identify management measures for which the risk of the ecosystem entering an undesirable state is below a specified level. The Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR) is responsible for the EBM of Antarctic krill fisheries. CCAMLR used soft reference points for the krill stock in the Scotia Sea and southern Drake Passage to set a regional catch limit. However, this catch limit needs spatial subdivision to protect predators from localized depletion. Model-based evaluations of different options for subdividing the catch limit used illustrative reference points to assess the depletion risk to multiple predators. This study demonstrates that the apparent risk is sensitive to the choice of reference point and method for aggregating modelled predators. EBM practitioners and stakeholders need to be aware that these factors could therefore bias comparisons of management measures. Nonetheless, qualitative distinctions between different spatial subdivision options are relatively consistent except at high levels of aggregation and extreme reference points. This study also demonstrates a lack of generality in the relationship between current and future ecosystem state. Thus, the EBM goal of maintaining ecosystem resilience implies different reference points for the current state of different ecosystem components. Despite early progress in defining soft reference points for the krill stock, CCAMLR has not yet defined reference points for krill predators. Structured dialogue aimed at identifying collective objectives might be necessary to achieve further progress in CCAMLR and other EBM organizations.

Improving the Accuracy of Krill Target Strength Using a Shape Catalog	FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE												Antarctic krill are subject to precautionary catch limits, based on biomass estimates, to ensure human activities do not adversely impact their important ecological role. Accurate target strength models of individual krill underpin biomass estimates. These models are scaled using measured and estimated distributions of length and orientation. However, while the length distribution of a krill swarm is accessible from net samples, there is currently limited consensus on the method for estimating krill orientation distribution. This leads to a limiting factor in biomass calculations. In this work, we consider geometric shape as a variable in target strength calculations and describe a practical method for generating a catalog of krill shapes. A catalog of shapes produces a more variable target strength response than an equivalent population of a scaled generic shape. Furthermore, using a shape catalog has the greatest impact on backscattering cross-section (linearized target strength) where the dominant scattering mechanism is mie scattering, irrespective of orientation distribution weighting. We suggest that shape distributions should be used in addition to length and orientation distributions to improve the accuracy of krill biomass estimates.

Temporal changes in digestive gland lipid composition of Euphausia superba in controlled conditions	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												Two phytoplankton diets with markedly different fatty acid (FA) profiles (thraustochytrid and diatom over a range of concentrations) were fed to juvenile Euphausia superba Dana to evaluate the time lapse required for the development of trophic lipid signatures in the digestive gland (DG). Krill were collected after 5, 10 and 20 d of feeding on thraustochytrids. Krill fed on thraustochytrids for 20 d were also collected after a further 5, 10 and 20 d of feeding on diatoms. An accumulation of polar lipid (0.4 mg per DG) was observed after 5 d of feeding on thraustochytrids at every concentration of food, The deposition of triacylglycerol (0.25 mg per DG) required 10 d of feeding and only occurred at the 2 highest food concentrations. Amounts of thraustochytrid-derived FA, 14:0, 16:0 22:6 omega 3 and 22:5 omega 6, increased after 10 d of feeding. The final concentration of 22:6 omega 3 was dependent on food concentration. Though it was absent in the diet, the essential FA 20:5 omega 3 accumulated from the retroconversion of 22:6 omega 3 after 20 d. Changing the krill diet to diatoms resulted in a marked decline in thraustochytrid FA, particularly 14:0 and 22:6 omega 3, after 5 d, whilst diatom FA, 16:1 omega 7 and 20:5 omega 3, remained constant. Thraustochytrid signatures were completely erased from the FA profiles of DG after 20 d feeding on diatoms. Slow accumulation of storage lipid and short residence time of dietary FA suggest that lipid turnover rates are high in Antarctic krill DG.

J	Auerswald, L; Meyer, B; Teschke, M; Hagen, W; Kawaguchi, S				Auerswald, Lutz; Meyer, Bettina; Teschke, Mathias; Hagen, Wilhelm; Kawaguchi, So			Physiological response of adult Antarctic krill, Euphausia superba, to long-term starvation	POLAR BIOLOGY												Adult Euphausia superba survive winter without or with little feeding. It is not exactly known whether the scarcity of food or an internal clock, set by the natural Antarctic light regime, are responsible for non-feeding. Our research questions were therefore the following: (1) How will physiological and biochemical conditions of krill change during long-term starvation at constant light regime? (2) If and how do enzyme activities change during such starvation? (3) What is the influence of food availability versus that of light regime? To answer these questions, adult krill were starved under laboratory conditions for 12 weeks with constant light regime (12:12; dark/light) and the impact on physiological functions was studied. Initial experimental condition of krill resembled the condition of late spring krill in the field with fully active metabolism and low lipid reserves. Metabolic activity and activities of enzymes catabolising lipids decreased after the onset of starvation and remained low throughout, whereas lipid reserves declined and lipid composition changed. Mass and size of krill decreased while the inter-moult period increased. Depletion of storage- and structural metabolites occurred in the order of depot lipids and glycogen reserves after onset of starvation until proteins were almost exclusively used after 6-7 weeks of starvation. Results confirmed various proposed overwintering mechanisms such as metabolic slowdown, slow growth or shrinkage and use of lipid reserves. However, these changes were set in motion by food shortage only, i.e. without the trigger of a changing light regime.

AK was used to replace 0 (control), 25%, 50% and 100% of the fishmeal in the basic diet of crayfish to formulate four test feeds with basically equivalent nitrogen and lipid contents; these feeds were denoted AKO, AK25, AK50 and AK100, respectively. Compared with the control group, crayfish fed diets with AK replacement showed increased body weight gain; feed efficiency; survival rate; body protein content; phenoloxidase, superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase activities; total haemocyte counts; number of hyaline, semigranular and granular cells; and disease resistance against Aeromonas hydrophila. Conversely, the body lipid level of these crayfish decreased relative to that of the control. However, a high AK level (AK100) does not show improvements in efficiency compared with a moderate AK level (AK50). Based on the efficiency of AK in enhancing the growth performance and nonspecific immunity of crayfish, the optimum replacement proportion of fishmeal with AK was 50%. These results confirm that AK can promote the growth of crayfish and improve their disease resistance.																	1050-4648	1095-9947				JAN	2020	96						122	125		10.1016/j.fsi.2019.12.004							WOS:000509617400014	31805411

Diets with healthy nutrition are efficient means to prevent this epidemic occurrence. Novel food resources and process technology were needed for these purpose. In this study, Antarctic krill oil (KO) extracted from a dry krill by a procedure of hot pump dehydration in combined with freezing-drying was used to investigate health effect in animals including the growth, lipid and glucose metabolism. Methods: C57BL/6J mice were fed with a lard based high fat (HF) diet and substituted with KO for a period of 12 weeks in comparison with low fat normal control (NC) diet. Mice body weight and food consumption were recorded. Serum lipid metabolism - of C57BL/6J mice serum was measured. A glucose tolerance tests (GTTs) and pathology analysis of mice were performed at the end of the experiment. Results: The KO fed mice had less body weight gain, less fat accumulation in tissue such as adipose and liver. Dyslipidemia induced by high fat diet was partially improved by KO feeding with significant reduction of serum low density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) content. Furthermore, KO feeding also improved glucose metabolism in C57BL/6J mice including a glucose tolerance of about 22% vs. 32% of AUC (area under the curve) for KO vs HF diet and the fast blood glucose level of 8.5 mmol/L, 9.8 mmol/L and 9.3 mmol/L for NC, HF and KO diet groups, respectively. In addition, KO feeding also reduced oxidative damage in liver with a decrease of malondialdehyde (MDA) content and increase of superoxide dismutase (SOD) content. Conclusion: This study provided evidence of the beneficial effects of KO on animal health from the processed technology, particularly on lipid and glucose metabolism. This study confirmed that as the Antarctic krill was extracted with a procedure of efficient energy, it might make it possible for Krill oil to be available for food industry.				cao, peirang/AAH-1746-2019	cao, peirang/0000-0003-4729-5478												1476-511X					NOV 21	2017	16								218	10.1186/s12944-017-0601-8							WOS:000416008400001	29157255					
J	Atkinson, A; Snyder, R				Atkinson, A; Snyder, R			Krill-copepod interactions at South Georgia, Antarctica, I. Omnivory by Euphausia superba	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												Feeding by juvenile Antarctic krill Euphausia superba near South Georgia was assessed during the austral summer of 1995/1996. Gut fluorescence results were compared with those from incubations in natural seawater and seawater enriched with phytoplankton and zooplankton. In natural seawater, with typically low food concentrations (median 56 mg C m(-3)) the median ration was 0.68 % of krill carbon d(-1). Phytoplankton dominated carbon in the natural incubation water but dinoflagellates, ciliates and small calanoid copepods dominated the carbon intake of krill. In both natural and enriched water, maximum clearance rates were on 1 to 3 mm calanoid copepods. Copepods larger than this (e.g. late copepodite stages of Calanoides acutus and Rhincalanus gigas) were cleared more slowly despite dominating the carbon in the enriched incubations. Oithona spp. were cleared more slowly than calanoids of similar size, despite their greater abundance and their similar contributions to available carbon. These trends could reflect detection/escape interactions between krill and copepods. With enriched food, copepods dominated krill diet, krill rations exceeded 10 % of body carbon d(-1) and rations did not appear to reach a plateau even at food concentrations of similar to 1 g C m(-3). This suggests that krill could feed rapidly during periodic encounters with layers or patches of zooplankton. Gut fluorescence revealed gut passage times of 3.7 to 6.3 h and an algal carbon ration of 0.43 % d(-1), thus supporting the low algal carbon rations derived from the incubations. Published acoustic values of mean krill biomass north of South Georgia that summer of 8.3 g dry mass m(-2) were combined with their clearance rates to give estimates of krill removing daily 0.2% of phytoplankton standing stocks, 0.6% of protozoans and 1.6% of small calanoid copepods. This impact on copepods is much higher than previous estimates from Antarctic amphipods and chaetognaths. The long generation times of Antarctic copepods mean that krill were potentially important predators of small copepods during our study.																	0171-8630						1997	160						63	76		10.3354/meps160063							WOS:000071722800007

The trophic information for this species during the transition from the austral fall to the winter is important to understand its poorly known overwintering mechanisms. However, the few studies on the topic differ in their results, in terms of both spatial and temporal variables. We investigated the size dependence and monthly and regional variation in delta C-13 and delta N-15 values of adult krill in the Antarctic Peninsula, in the austral fall (April to May) and the early winter (June). We aimed to examine the trophic variations of krill occurred during this period, and the relationship between krill and their feeding environment in the Antarctic marine ecosystem. The following results were obtained: (1) no significant relationship was observed between size and the delta C-13 value of krill, but the delta N-15 value of krill presented a remarkable association with size; (2) the delta C-13 values of krill increased during the austral fall, but no remarkable variation existed at the onset of winter, and the delta N-15 values were not significant different during this period; (3) mean delta N-15 values of krill differed significantly between the Bransfield Strait and the South Shetland Islands. Our data imply that adult krill present size-, season-, and region-dependent trophic variation during the transition from austral fall to early winter in the Antarctic Peninsula.

J	Ruck, KE; Steinberg, DK; Canuel, EA				Ruck, Kate E.; Steinberg, Deborah K.; Canuel, Elizabeth A.			Regional differences in quality of krill and fish as prey along the Western Antarctic Peninsula	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												The warming trend in the northern part of the Western Antarctic Peninsula (WAP) has led to a decrease in perennial and summer sea ice, an increase in heat content over the shelf, and lower phytoplankton biomass, which could affect the prey quality of krill and fish that are utilized by apex predators. We compared prey quality metrics, including elemental (C, N) content; total, neutral, and polar lipid content; and energy densities of known penguin prey items including krill (Euphausia superba, Thysanoessa macrura, and E. crystallorophias) and fish (silverfish Pleuragramma antarcticum and the myctophid Electrona antarctica) along the WAP latitudinal gradient each January from 2009 to 2011. E. antarctica had the highest prey quality in terms of lipid content and energy density, followed by T. macrura and P. antarcticum, then E. crystallorophias and E. superba. For all species, variations in C and N content were most strongly correlated with the animals' neutral lipid content, in that animals with the larger neutral lipid stores had significantly higher C and lower N content. Across all sexes and maturity stages, E. superba in the southern study region had ca. 20% higher total lipid content than E. superba in the north, and a stepwise multiple linear regression analysis showed that latitude, sexual differences, and upper water column temperatures best explained this regional difference in lipid content. This regional variability in E. superba prey quality could affect the ability of apex predators that rely on E. superba to meet their energetic demands, and should be considered in future modeling efforts.																	0171-8630	1616-1599					2014	509						39	55		10.3354/meps10868							WOS:000341570100004

This dataset allowed comparison between seasons, years (2013-2016), and different fishing locations. Quantities of omega 3 fatty acids 20: 5n-3 and 22: 6n-3 (mg/g dry mass; DM) were highest in autumn and decreased through winter to reach a spring low. Quantities of the flagellate marker 18: 4n-3 and diatom marker 16: 1n-7c were variable and did not display the same seasonal fluctuations. In summer, krill had high percentages (% total fatty acids) of 20: 5n-3 and 22: 6n-3, total PUFA, and low 18: 1n-9c/18: 1n-7c ratios, indicating a more herbivorous diet. Krill became more omnivorous from autumn to spring, indicated by increasing ratios of 18: 1n-9c/18: 1n-7c and percentages of Sigma 20: 1 + 22: 1 isomers. Bacterial fatty acids (Sigma C-15 + C-17 + C-19 isomers) were minor components year-round (0.9-1.8 %). Seasonal levels of herbivory and omnivory differed between years, and levels of specific fatty acid ratios differed between fishing locations. The fatty acid 18: 4n-3 was a major driver of variability in krill fatty acid composition, with no obvious seasonal driver. This is the first study to report krill fatty acid data during all four seasons over consecutive years. This large-scale study highlights the value of using fisheries samples to examine seasonal and annual fluctuations in krill diet and condition.

From 18 February to 9 March 2002, mean total target strengths (TTS 10 log(sigma(t)/4pi)), were measured from groups of 57-1169 krill (average standard length 31.6 turn; standard deviation = 6.6 mm) at the Cape Shirreff field station, Livingston Island, Antarctica, and aboard RV "Yuzhmorgeologiya". Chirp pulses were transmitted sequentially by an omni-directional emitter into one of three glass carboys containing groups of krill swimming in 9.3, 19.3, or 45.9 liters of seawater (0.6degreesC less than or equal totemperatureless than or equal to 4.0degreesC). Between each pulse the krill moved within the fixed-boundary tank and the modulated reverberations were sensed bi-statically with three omni-directional receivers. At each center frequency (f(c)) the coherent energy in 200-pulse ensembles identified sound scattered by the tank. The incoherent energy described total sound scattering from the krill, Thus, the TTS at each f(c) was extracted from a correlation analysis of energy reverberated in the tank. Measurement bias was determined to be +/-0.4 dB from an experiment using metal sphere reference targets, and the precision was estimated as +/-0.8 dB from the variability in the krill TTS (f(c)) measurements. The empirical estimates of mean sigma(t) corroborated a krill-scattering model based on the distorted-wave Born approximation (DWBA), enhanced by the authors to account for the stochastic nature of sound scattering (SDWBA), integrated over all scattering angles and averaged over all incident angles (SDWBA(TTS)). The SDWBA, solved for target strength of Antarctic krill, may be the best predictor of backscatter for this important species and may also provide backscattering spectra for improving their acoustic identification. These advances may help to reduce uncertainty in krill-biomass estimation using multi-frequency echosounder data and echo-integration methods.

To examine this, krill were sampled and fed for 16 days exclusively on the locally abundant copepod Drepanopus forcipatus. After 16 days, the krill had increased their PUFA content from 28 to 54% of the total fatty acids. Concurrently, monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs) and saturated fatty acids (SFAs) decreased from 41 to 27%. Thus, the krill appeared to accumulate PUFAs as reflected in their diet of D. forcipatus, which also had a relatively high PUFA content (50%). Overall, the results support omnivorous feeding by krill at South Georgia during nonbloom periods. We propose that the ratio of PUFA to SFA content may be used to detect carnivory in the recent feeding history of krill and suggest that this may be an index which could be applied to other zooplankton.																	0706-652X						2000	57			3			31	37		10.1139/cjfas-57-S3-31							WOS:000166531600005

Bengtson			Turning microplastics into nanoplastics through digestive fragmentation by Antarctic krill	NATURE COMMUNICATIONS												Microplastics (plastics < 5mm diameter) are at the forefront of current environmental pollution research, however, little is known about the degradation of microplastics through ingestion. Here, by exposing Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) to microplastics under acute static renewal conditions, we present evidence of physical size alteration of microplastics ingested by a planktonic crustacean. Ingested microplastics (31.5 mu m) are fragmented into pieces less than 1 mu m in diameter. Previous feeding studies have shown spherical microplastics either; pass unaffected through an organism and are excreted, or are sufficiently small for translocation to occur. We identify a new pathway; microplastics are fragmented into sizes small enough to cross physical barriers, or are egested as a mixture of triturated particles. These findings suggest that current laboratory-based feeding studies may be oversimplifying interactions between zooplankton and microplastics but also introduces a new role of Antarctic krill, and potentially other species, in the biogeochemical cycling and fate of plastic.

The main purpose of this paper is to compare the properties of C/AKP composite fibers prepared by centrifugal spinning and wet spinning. The hydrogen bond type, break strength, morphology, crystallinity, and thermal stability are analyzed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, electronic single silk strength testing, X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, and differential scanning calorimetry. The results show that the C/AKP composite fibers contain intramolecular hydrogen bonds (OH-OH and annular polymer bonds) and intermolecular hydrogen bonds (OH-pi, OH-ether O, and OH-N). The centrifugal spinning composite fibers have a higher percentage of intermolecular hydrogen bonds, a higher break strength, and higher crystallinity than the wet spinning fibers. The wet spinning composite fibers have a more obvious groove structure and a higher degree of swelling than the centrifugally spun fibers.																	1229-9197	1875-0052				AUG	2019	20	8					1547	1554		10.1007/s12221-019-8725-2							WOS:000483661500001

The proteins were solubilized two times; a water/krill ratio (mL/g) of 6 and a time of 30 min were used for the first step, whereas the second used a water/krill residue ratio (mL/g) of 3 and a time of 30 min. The optimum pH for protein precipitation was 4.6. A LFP with fluoride content of 9.86 mg/kg (dry weight) was finally obtained through a fluoride removal program. The protein yield of LFP was 52.68%. Composition analysis of LFP indicated it was composed of 66.96% of crude proteins (dry weight) and 33.01% of total lipids (dry weight)(n) and all nine essential amino acids were in sufficient amounts to meet FAO/WHO/UNU requirements for adults and infants. In addition, LFP could be taken as a good source of EPA and DHA for consideration of use as a food item for human consumption.				yuming, wang/K-8179-2012													0021-8561	1520-5118				JUN 8	2011	59	11					6108	6112		10.1021/jf201009t							WOS:000291074700040	21539395

Individual fresh mass varied from 0.16 to 1.72 g [median values of 0.47 g (0.16 to 0.94), 1.14 g (0.71 to 1.63) and 1.46 g (0.94 to 1.72) for immatures, males and females respectively]. Lipid amounts varied from 5 to 147 mg ind.(-1) [median values of 17.8 mg (5.1 to 64.2), 21.0 mg (9.3 to 87.7) and 70.3 mg (17.3 to 146.9) for immatures, males and females respectively]. Triacylglycerol (TAG) and phosphatidylcholine were the 2 most abundant lipid classes in all krill. Multivariate analysis of lipid composition indicated significant overlap between sex-maturity classes, although female krill tended to be distinguished from males by higher proportions of TAG and lower proportions of phosphatidylserine plus phosphatidylinositol. Reproductive investment is implicated in the overall variability in Lipid content and composition, with females containing high lipid levels as reserves for egg production, whilst males showed apparent Lipid deficits resulting from short-term mobilisation of storage material for spermatophore production and attachment. Significant and systematic site-to-site variability in Lipid content and composition were evident in the samples and this could not be explained by the sex ratio or krill size.																	0171-8630					FEB	1995	117	1-3					49	57		10.3354/meps117049							WOS:A1995QJ84800005

Identifying Risk: Concurrent Overlap of the Antarctic Krill Fishery with Krill-Dependent Predators in the Scotia Sea	PLOS ONE												Mitigating direct and indirect interactions between marine predators and fisheries is a motivating factor for ecosystem-based fisheries management (EBFM), especially where predators and fisheries compete for a shared resource. One difficulty in advancing EBFM is parameterizing clear functional responses of predators to indices of prey availability. Alternative characterizations of fishery-predator interactions may therefore benefit the implementation of EBFM. Telemetry data identify foraging areas used by predators and, therefore, represent critical information to mitigate potential competition between predators and fisheries. We analyzed six years (2009-2014) of telemetry data collected at Cape Shirreff, Livingston Island and Admiralty Bay, King George Island, Antarctica, on three species of Pygoscelid penguins and female Antarctic fur seals. In this region, all four species are primarily dependent on Antarctic krill. The tracking data demonstrate local movements near breeding colonies during the austral summer and dispersal from breeding colonies during the winter. We then assessed overlap between predators and the Antarctic krill fishery on a suite of spatiotemporal scales to examine how different data aggregations affect the extent and location of overlap. Concurrent overlap was observed on all spatiotemporal scales considered throughout the Antarctic Peninsula and South Orkney Islands region, including near tagging locations and in distant areas where recent fishing activity has concentrated. Overlap occurred at depths where mean krill densities were relatively high. Our results demonstrate that direct overlap of krill-dependent predators with the krill fishery on small spatiotemporal scales is relatively common throughout the Antarctic Peninsula region. As the krill fishery continues to develop and efforts to implement ecosystem-based management mature, indices of overlap may provide a useful metric for indicating where the risks of fishing are highest. A precautionary approach to allocating krill catches in space would be to avoid large increases in catch where overlap on small spatiotemporal scales is common.				, Jefferson/AAG-1702-2021	, Jefferson/0000-0002-3600-1414												1932-6203					JAN 13	2017	12	1							e0170132	10.1371/journal.pone.0170132							WOS:000391972600066	28085943					
J	Grunbaum, D; Veit, RR				Grunbaum, D; Veit, RR			Black-browed albatrosses foraging on Antarctic krill: Density-dependence through local enhancement?	ECOLOGY												Many Antarctic seabirds depend on prey that are patchy, cryptic, ephemeral, and unpredictable in location. These predators typically employ two alternative behavioral strategies for locating resource patches: direct visual or olfactory detection, and indirect detection (local enhancement) by sighting other predators that are already exploiting a patch. We developed a model of direct detection and local enhancement in seabirds that predicts how foraging success varies with behavioral strategy, seabird densities, and prey swarm density and detectability. Application of the model to Black-browed Albatrosses foraging for Antarctic krill near South Georgia suggests that local enhancement is generally a highly effective foraging strategy, and that the fraction of time albatrosses spend in feeding flocks should show strong interactions between prey and conspecific densities. To test these predictions, we analyzed survey data collected near South Georgia in January-March 1986. Our analysis suggests a strong Allee-type density dependence in foraging success that was qualitatively and quantitatively consistent with model predictions. This density dependence suggests a potential for destabilizing patterns of resource utilization and reproductive success in Black-browed Albatrosses that may have important implications for conservation of albatrosses and other Antarctic species.																	0012-9658	1939-9170				DEC	2003	84	12					3265	3275		10.1890/01-4098							WOS:000187973500016

There was no significant change in any biometric index (dry weight vs length, carbon vs dry weight, nitrogen vs dry weight, or body C:N). Rates of ammonium excretion in winter were not significantly different from those previously reported for E. superba in summer. It was clear that E. superba fed as a carnivore in winter. Copepod body parts consistently occurred in krill guts. During winter shipboard experiments, freshly caught krill ingested copepods and produced faeces at rates comparable to those measured in summer. The low ratio of N:P excretion (2.02) also suggests carnivorous feeding. A physiological model of carbon and nitrogen metabolism indicates that E. superba must feed during winter to maintain its observed C:N ratio and rate of ammonium excretion. On a diet of less than 1 Metridia gerlachei female copepod per day, a 20 mm krill can grow with a growth efficiency comparable to that achieved in summer. We suggest that starvation, body shrinkage and reduced metabolism are unusual behaviors for krill in winter, and that carnivory sustains growth until ice algae become available as food in late winter and early spring.																	0171-8630					APR	1994	107	1-2					23	40		10.3354/meps107023							WOS:A1994NH21600003

Age information for Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) will be important for stock assessment modeling and future feedback management of krill fisheries. Samples stored in 70% ethanol provide an opportunity to detect the growth bands of eyestalk sections. Moreover, information derived from samples preserved in formalin will have a greater impact on the feedback management process because this preservation method was more common in previous decades. Out of 162 Antarctic krill individuals preserved in 5% formalin, the growth bands from eyestalk sections of 134 samples were readable. The relationship between the total length and the growth bands in the eyestalk was analyzed. Three main parameters, including exact percent agreement (EPA), coefficient of variation (CV), and average percentage error (APE), were used to evaluate the precision of the growth bands. Results show decreased CV and APE values and an increase in the EPA value with the accumulation of reading runs. This method is direct and uses a grinding and polishing technique before reading, contrary to Krafft et al. (2016) and Kilada et al. (2017). Combined with published studies, specimens collected from autumn to winter in this study can provide a better understanding of Antarctic krill growth. This study presents important information for age determination, particularly for specimens preserved in formalin, and will benefit the stock assessment and acoustic estimation of this species in the future. Further studies are required to validate the correlation between growth bands and age. Additionally, more samples from different seasons and regions are also needed to fully understand the growth dynamics of this species.

In the current study, the in vivo effects of Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) oil (AKO) on dexamethasone-treated mice were investigated. Results showed that AKO significantly prevents bone loss, as evidenced by improved bone mineral density, biomechanical strength, and cancellous bone microstructure. Fluorescence double-labeling of femur showed that AKO induces new bone formation. Toluidine blue staining of marrow cavity indicated that AKO increases the number of trabecula, and decreases the generation of adipose cells. Runt-related transcription factor 2 (Runx2) and Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) are the switches for osteogenic and adipogenic differentiation of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells, respectively. AKO significantly promoted the expression of Runx2 protein, and reduced PPAR expression in bone tissue. Furthermore, AKO increased the mRNA expression of osteogenesis-related genes and decreased the expression of adipogenesis-related genes. In conclusion, AKO improved glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis via promoting bone formation.																	1226-7708	2092-6456				APR	2019	28	2					539	545		10.1007/s10068-018-0463-5							WOS:000462163300026	30956866

Krill space: a comparative assessment of mesoscale structuring in polar and temperate marine ecosystems	ICES JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE												The spatial organization, mesoscale variability, and habitat associations of krill within portions of the Antarctic Peninsula and California Current marine ecosystems are compared. Using a decade of acoustic observations and remotely sensed oceanography (2000-2009), the hypothesis that mesoscale spatial organization of krill in both systems closely relates to geospatial variability of the shelf break and is non-linearly related to geostrophic flow and positively related to chlorophyll a (Chl a) is tested. Directional-dependence analysis to measure spatial variability of krill is used along with spatially explicit generalized additive models to quantify and compare the spatial relationships among krill and habitat characteristics in both systems. The results suggest the following aspects of krill spatial organization: (i) areas of dense aggregation, i. e. hot spots, are present in both systems and are orientated in the direction of the shelf break, (ii) moderate levels of eddy kinetic energy seem to concentrate krill in favourable habitats and lessen the likelihood of advection away from the system, and (iii) variable responses to surface Chl a concentration suggest that realtime Chl a values may not be useful as a global predictor of important krill habitat. The results provide valuable reference points for marine spatial management of krill and for refining ecosystem and foodweb models.																	1054-3139	1095-9289				SEP	2012	69	7					1317	1327		10.1093/icesjms/fss048							WOS:000308012000021

Trends, cycles, interannual variability for three pelagic species west of the Antarctic Peninsula 1993-2008	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												The Palmer Long Term Ecological Research study region west of the Antarctic Peninsula is experiencing warming and changing seasonal sea ice dynamics. Abundance patterns of 3 species of pelagic secondary producers were analyzed for trends, cycles, range extensions or shifts in the location of highest density, and for changes in population dynamics over a 16 yr period (1993-2008). Species analyzed represented different hydrographic regimes and are known to have contrasting responses to seasonal sea ice dynamics: krill Euphausia superba, seasonal sea ice zone; tunicates Salpa thompsoni, warmer waters with minimal sea ice; and larval Antarctic silverfish Pleuragramma antarcticum, cold continental shelf waters. Cycles were observed in grid-wide abundance and recruitment for E. superba. Maximum grid-wide densities did not decrease, but the location of highest densities shifted southward 200 km, away from Adelie penguin rookeries at the northern end. A distinct change post-1999 was apparent in the frequency of occurrence and abundance of S. thompsoni. Mixtures of krill and salps became common, but neither peak densities nor the frequency of peak years for salps increased. As with Antarctic krill, highest salp densities shifted southward alongshore. Larval P. antarcticum were abundant in the northern coastal region in the early 1990s, but virtually disappeared in that region after 1999/2000. Possible mechanisms underlying these observations include the southerly movement of the sea ice edge during spring, changes in proximity of source populations (salps), and changes in transport pathways (larval P. antarcticum). Patterns are compared to those in the SW Atlantic.				Newberger, Timothy/AAR-7103-2020													0171-8630	1616-1599					2014	515						11	32		10.3354/meps10965							WOS:000345703500002						
J	Kasatkina, SM; Malyshko, AP; Shnar, VN; Berezhinsky, OA				Kasatkina, SM; Malyshko, AP; Shnar, VN; Berezhinsky, OA			Characteristics of krill aggregations in the South Sandwich Islands Subarea in January-February 2000	CCAMLR SCIENCE												During the survey of Subarea 48.4 from 17 January to 1 February 2000 it was observed that krill was present in non-aggregated and scattered forms, as well as in swarms. Differences between spatial distribution patterns of different krill aggregation forms in relation to water mass structure and dynamics were revealed. Distributional features and physical characteristics of some 2 400 krill swarms detected in the study area were sized acoustically and are described in this paper. Results of comparisons of swarm parameters by area and season are given. The effect of spatial distribution patterns of krill aggregations on the horizontal and vertical distribution of krill biomass is shown. About 64% of the krill biomass was concentrated in krill swarms in the upper 80 m depth layer within meander and eddy zones of the Weddell Sea (14% of the study area). Spatial distribution patterns of krill aggregations and distribution of krill biomass density were analysed with a view to detecting potential fishing grounds where the recommended precautionary catch limit could be taken. Such fishing grounds could be located within the zones in which swarms were concentrated and where the biomass density was greater than 1.5 g m(-3). The biomass in these potential fishing grounds amounted to about 1.7 million tonnes. It was shown that the removal of biomass up to a recommended precautionary limit could be possible from such grounds despite a predicted low catch per hour of trawling.																	1023-4063						2002	9						145	164									WOS:000179438500011

Data were obtained using novel Surface and Under Ice Trawls (SUIT), which sampled the 0-2 m surface layer both under sea ice and in open water. Average surface layer densities ranged between 0.8 individuals m(-2) in summer and autumn, and 2.7 individuals m(-2) in winter. In summer, under-ice densities of Antarctic krill were significantly higher than in open waters. In autumn, the opposite pattern was observed. Under winter sea ice, densities were often low, but repeatedly far exceeded summer and autumn maxima. Statistical models showed that during summer high densities of Antarctic krill in the 0-2 m layer were associated with high ice coverage and shallow mixed layer depths, among other factors. In autumn and winter, density was related to hydrographical parameters. Average under-ice densities from the 0-2 m layer were higher than corresponding values from the 0-200 m layer collected with Rectangular Midwater Trawls (RMT) in summer. In winter, under-ice densities far surpassed maximum 0-200 m densities on several occasions. This indicates that the importance of the ice-water interface layer may be under-estimated by the pelagic nets and sonars commonly used to estimate the population size of Antarctic krill for management purposes, due to their limited ability to sample this habitat. Our results provide evidence for an almost year-round association of Antarctic krill with the under-ice habitat, hundreds of kilometres into the ice-covered area of the Lazarev Sea. Local concentrations of postlarval Antarctic krill under winter sea ice suggest that sea ice biota are important for their winter survival. These findings emphasise the susceptibility of an ecological key species to changing sea ice habitats, suggesting potential ramifications on Antarctic ecosystems induced by climate change.

Seasonal changes in photoperiod in Antarctica, ranging from midnight sun (24 h light) during mid-summer to very short days (3-4 h light) during mid-winter, represent a challenge for the synchronization of the krill circadian clock. We analyzed clock gene activity and clock output functions in krill exposed to different light conditions during a long-term photoperiodic simulation in the laboratory. In simulated early-autumn (light/dark or LD 16: 8) and late-winter (LD 8: 16) conditions, the circadian clock of krill was functional and the metabolic output was synchronized to the light/dark cycle, the clock genes Esper and Esclk peaked in antiphase around simulated dusk/dawn and most metabolic-related genes showed upregulation around simulated dusk. In contrast, in simulated mid-summer (light/light or LL) and mid-winter (LD 3: 21) conditions, the synchronization of the circadian clock and the metabolic output appeared to be weaker, with clock gene expression becoming arrhythmic and upregulation of metabolic genes occurring at different times during the day. Early-autumn and late-winter photoperiodic cues in the laboratory thus seem to be sufficient to entrain the krill clock and promote metabolic synchronization, whereas midwinter and mid-summer photoperiodic cues seem to be insufficient for krill entrainment. Krill in the field may overcome the seasonal lack of overt photoperiodic cycle occurring during midsummer and mid-winter by using alternative light-related Zeitgebers (i.e., varying light intensity rather than the presence or absence of light) to promote basic homeostatic rhythms over 24 h.

Results supported the hypothesis of a functional relationship between egg production and molt development for the duration of the reproductive season (March to August), with one reproductive cycle being made up of two molt cycles. Females remained in reproductive condition throughout the reproductive season, and the timing of their spawning and molting was synchronized at the population level throughout this period. A semiempirical model predicted that the krill population produced an egg pulse every 20 to 26 d (depending on temperature), and three cohorts were evident in net samples taken later in the year. The likely date on which the first cohort was spawned was around 26 d after the main phytoplankton bloom, suggesting that the bloom triggered egg development in all adult females. Such a synchronized spawning period was observed directly in adult females 26 d after a bloom in March 2000. A total of three cohorts over the 6-month reproductive season is less than the maximum of seven that would be possible if spawning occurred at a periodicity of between 20 and 26 d, suggesting that larval recruitment was not always successful. Analysis showed that successful recruitment was only achieved when chlorophyll a levels were adequate during both the period of egg maturation in the ovary and the subsequent development of larvae, especially the furcilia stages.																	0024-3590					SEP	2003	48	5					2020	2033		10.4319/lo.2003.48.5.2020							WOS:000185433700028

Interannual spatial variability of krill (Euphausia superba) influences seabird foraging behavior near Elephant Island, Antarctica	FISHERIES OCEANOGRAPHY												We investigate the influence of krill (principally Euphausia superba) patchiness on the foraging distributions of seabirds to understand how variation in krill influences patch dynamics between krill and birds. At sea-surveys were conducted near Elephant Island, Antarctica, for 3 yr (2004-2006) during the annual U.S. Antarctic Marine Living Resources (AMLR) program. Standardized strip-transect surveys were used to map seabirds, and a combination of acoustic and net surveys was used to map krill. We measured patch size of krill and seabirds and elucidated how krill patch dynamics influence foraging seabirds. The spatial association between krill and predators was influenced by the size and arrangement of krill patches. We found a negative relationship between abundance and patchiness of krill and predators, indicating that when krill is less abundant, its predators are less abundant and concentrated. We conclude that annual patch dynamics of krill strongly influences the local abundance and distribution of seabirds. Such information should be used to interpret potential interactions between seabirds and krill fisheries operating near Elephant Island.																	1054-6006	1365-2419					2009	18	1					20	35		10.1111/j.1365-2419.2008.00490.x							WOS:000262887400002

Further observation of gut samples by scanning electron microscopy indicated that the ciliates were symbionts located within the gut.

J	Alonzo, SH; Switzer, PV; Mangel, M				Alonzo, SH; Switzer, PV; Mangel, M			Ecological games in space and time: The distribution and abundance of Antarctic krill and penguins	ECOLOGY												The distribution and abundance of organisms are affected by behaviors, such as habitat selection, foraging, and reproduction. These behaviors are driven by interactions within and between species, environmental conditions, and the biology of the species involved. Although extensive theoretical work has explored predator-prey dynamics, these models have not considered the impact of behavioral plasticity and life-history trade-offs on predicted patterns. We apply a modeling method that allows the consideration of a spatial, dynamic ecological game between predators and prey using a life-history perspective. As an illustrative example, we model the habitat selection of Antarctic krill- and penguins during the time when penguins are land-based for reproduction. Although environmental conditions and the life-history constraints of each species have both direct and indirect effects on both species, the penguin's foraging rule (whether food-maximizing or time-minimizing) has the greatest effect on the qualitative distribution pattern of both species. Size-dependent-diel vertical migration of krill also strongly affects penguin foraging patterns. This model generates suggestions for future research and qualitative predictions that can be tested in the field. The application of this method to a specific problem also demonstrates its ability to increase our understanding of important ecological interactions in general.																	0012-9658	1939-9170				JUN	2003	84	6					1598	1607		10.1890/0012-9658(2003)084[1598:EGISAT]2.0.CO;2							WOS:000184451900028

In this study, the protective effects of KO treatment were investigated in dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced ulcerative colitis (UC) mice. This study showed that the KO effectively ameliorated colitis symptoms, reduced the excessive production of inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, TNF-?), and inhibited the activation of NF-?B signaling pathway. The KO also decreased the concentration of LPS and DAO, and increased the gene expression of tight junction proteins. Moreover, the KO reduced the relative abundance of Firmicutes/Bacteroides, restored the structure of intestinal microbiota, and increased the content of SCFAs. All the improved characteristics promoted the intestinal health of mice. All these findings suggest that the KO could ameliorate colitis symptoms, inhibit inflammatory response, repair intestinal damage, and regulate intestinal microbiota and SCFAs. Thus, the KO might be a promising candidate for the dietary treatment of UC and improve the intestinal symbiosis.																	1756-4646	2214-9414				APR	2021	79								104394	10.1016/j.jff.2021.104394							WOS:000641380600008

Implications for the mesopelagic microbial gardening hypothesis as determined by experimental fragmentation of Antarctic krill fecal pellets	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION												Detritivores need to upgrade their food to increase its nutritional value. One method is to fragment detritus promoting the colonization of nutrient-rich microbes, which consumers then ingest along with the detritus; so-called microbial gardening. Observations and numerical models of the detritus-dominated ocean mesopelagic zone have suggested microbial gardening by zooplankton is a fundamental process in the ocean carbon cycle leading to increased respiration of carbon-rich detritus. However, no experimental evidence exists to demonstrate that microbial respiration rates are higher on recently fragmented sinking detrital particles. Using aquaria-reared Antarctic krill fecal pellets, we showed fragmentation increased microbial particulate organic carbon (POC) turnover by 1.9x, but only on brown fecal pellets, formed from the consumption of other pellets. Microbial POC turnover on un- and fragmented green fecal pellets, formed from consuming fresh phytoplankton, was equal. Thus, POC content, fragmentation, and potentially nutritional value together drive POC turnover rates. Mesopelagic microbial gardening could be a risky strategy, as the dominant detrital food source is settling particles; even though fragmentation decreases particle size and sinking rate, it is unlikely that an organism would remain with the particle long enough to nutritionally benefit from attached microbes. We propose "communal gardening" occurs whereby additional mesopelagic organisms nearby or below the site of fragmentation consume the particle and the colonized microbes. To determine how fragmentation impacts the remineralization of sinking carbon-rich detritus and to parameterize microbial gardening in mesopelagic carbon models, three key metrics from further controlled experiments and observations are needed; how particle composition (here, pellet color/krill diet) impacts the response of microbes to the fragmentation of particles; the nutritional benefit to zooplankton from ingesting microbes after fragmentation along with identification of which essential nutrients are being targeted; how both these factors vary between physical (shear) and biological particle fragmentation.

The structure and properties of fibers were characterized by different techniques including FTIR, NMR, XRD, SAXS, SEM and electronic single yarn strength tester, etc. The results indicate that the reaction of GA with C and AKP separately forms a multiple cross-linking network. The C/AKP composite fibers with a multiple cross-linking network has stronger crystallization ability, higher orientation degree and deeper trench than C/AKP composite fibers. The breaking stress and wet strength of composite fibers reaches the maximum of 1.04 cN/dtex and 0.55 cN/dtex at GA content of 0.2 wt%. And the fatigue and tensile properties, hygroscopicity and moisture retention of C/AKP composite fibers has been improved. The development of C/AKP composite fibers with a multiple cross-linking network could be a promising candidate for biomedicine applications.

The effect of the different stabilisers was evaluated both in solution and in dry samples of the enzymes. In 40% (w/v) stabiliser solutions, the increase in half-life of enzyme activity followed the pattern: sorbitol > xylitol > glycerol > sucrose > maltodextrins, when polyols and polysaccharides were used. In 3% (w/v) protein solutions, the stabilising effect followed the order: hydrolysed collagen > bovine serum albumin > casein. The best result was obtained in a 50% (w/v) sorbitol solution where a 12-fold half-life increase was achieved. Different mechanisms of stabilisation were observed for these two groups of substances. In 50% (w/w) dry enzyme/stabiliser mixtures, the increase in half-life of krill trypsin-like enzymes was: maltodextrins > sucrose > sorbitol > mannitol > xylitol. Dry samples were also prepared by coprecipitation of the enzyme/stabiliser mixture with 95% ethanol, followed by oven drying of the coprecipitates. Under these conditions, the modified maltodextrin PSM 10 (Reppe-Glykos AB, Sweden) gave the best result with a 25-fold half-life increase. The relevance of this result for the industrial application of krill trypsin-like enzymes is discussed.

Previous studies have postulated that the krill cycle is induced by periodic climatological factors, but these postulated drivers neither show consistent agreement, nor are they supported by quantitative models. Here, using data analysis complemented with modelling of krill ontogeny and population dynamics, we identify intraspecific competition for food as the main driver of the krill cycle, while external climatological factors possibly modulate its phase and synchronization over large scales. Our model indicates that the cycle amplitude increases with reduction of krill loss rates. Thus, a decline of apex predators is likely to increase the oscillation amplitude, potentially destabilizing the marine food web, with drastic consequences for the entire Antarctic ecosystem.

To further investigate this interaction, we undertook a study in McMurdo Sound during 2012-2013 and 2014-2015 using telemetry and biologging of whales and penguins, shore-based observations and quantification of the preyscape. The 3D distribution and density of prey were assessed using a remotely operated vehicle deployed along and to the interior of the fast-ice edge where AMWs and ADPEs focused their foraging. Acoustic surveys of prey and foraging behaviour of predators indicate that prey remained abundant under the fast ice, becoming successively available to air-breathing predators only as the fast ice retreated. Over both seasons, the ADPE diet included less krill and more Antarctic silverfish once AMWs became abundant, but the penguins' foraging behaviour (i.e. time spent foraging, dive depth, distance from colony) did not change. In addition, over time, krill abundance decreased in the upper water column near the ice edge, consistent with the hypothesis (and previously gathered information) that AMW and ADPE foraging contributed to an alteration of prey availability.

V.; Lange, Benjamin A.; Castellani, Giulia; Brandt, Angelika; Flores, Hauke			Sea-ice habitat minimizes grazing impact and predation risk for larval Antarctic krill	POLAR BIOLOGY												Survival of larval Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) during winter is largely dependent upon the presence of sea ice as it provides an important source of food and shelter. We hypothesized that sea ice provides additional benefits because it hosts fewer competitors and provides reduced predation risk for krill larvae than the water column. To test our hypothesis, zooplankton were sampled in the Weddell-Scotia Confluence Zone at the ice-water interface (0-2 m) and in the water column (0-500 m) during August-October 2013. Grazing by mesozooplankton, expressed as a percentage of the phytoplankton standing stock, was higher in the water column (1.97 +/- 1.84%) than at the ice-water interface (0.08 +/- 0.09%), due to a high abundance of pelagic copepods. Predation risk by carnivorous macrozooplankton, expressed as a percentage of the mesozooplankton standing stock, was significantly lower at the ice-water interface (0.83 +/- 0.57%; main predators amphipods, siphonophores and ctenophores) than in the water column (4.72 +/- 5.85%; main predators chaetognaths and medusae). These results emphasize the important role of sea ice as a suitable winter habitat for larval krill with fewer competitors and lower predation risk. These benefits should be taken into account when considering the response of Antarctic krill to projected declines in sea ice. Whether reduced sea-ice algal production may be compensated for by increased water column production remains unclear, but the shelter provided by sea ice would be significantly reduced or disappear, thus increasing the predation risk on krill larvae.

In this study, DPP-IV inhibitory peptides FAGDDAPR and LAPPRGSL were isolated from defatted Antarctic krill powder (DAKP) protein by the sequential purification of ultrafiltration, gel filtration chromatography, and RP-HPLC, and IC50 values of the two peptides were 349.70 +/- 3.66 mu M and 461.14 +/- 0.87 mu M, respectively. The FAGDDAPR and LAPPRGSL were identified by LC-MS/MS method, and the molecular models of DPP-IV and the two peptides were further constructed by AutoDock Vina software, the results revealed that the inhibition activity of FAGDDAPR and LAPPRGSL was mainly attributed to the formation of strong hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen bonds with amino acids of DPP-IV. Practical applications DAKP is an economical by-product produced in the production of krill oil and contains high-quality protein, but these products were mainly used as fish feed and had low utility value in the past. DPP-IV inhibitors are an efficacious drug employed in the treatment of hyperglycemia processes. However, these drugs can cause undesirable side effects. Thus, the development of new natural hypoglycemic drugs with low side effects is a valuable strategy to be applied in therapeutic interventions.																	0145-8884	1745-4514				SEP	2021	45	9							e13872	10.1111/jfbc.13872		JUL 2021					WOS:000678086700001	34296449

Detecting Climate Signals in Southern Ocean Krill Growth Habitat	FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE												Climate change is rapidly altering the habitat of Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba), a key species of the Southern Ocean food web. Krill are a critical element of Southern Ocean ecosystems as well as biogeochemical cycles, while also supporting an international commercial fishery. In addition to trends forced by global-scale, human-driven warming, the Southern Ocean is highly dynamic, displaying large fluctuations in surface climate on interannual to decadal timescales. The dual roles of forced climate change and natural variability affecting Antarctic krill habitat, and therefore productivity, complicate interplay of observed trends and contribute to uncertainty in future projections. We use the Community Earth System Model Large Ensemble (CESM-LE) coupled with an empirically derived model of krill growth to detect and attribute trends associated with "forced," human-driven climate change, distinguishing these from variability arising naturally. The forced trend in krill growth is characterized by a poleward contraction of optimal conditions and an overall reduction in Southern Ocean krill habitat. However, the amplitude of natural climate variability is relatively large, such that the forced trend cannot be formally distinguished from natural variability at local scales over much of the Southern Ocean by 2100. Our results illustrate how natural variability is an important driver of regional krill growth trends and can mask the forced trend until late in the 21st century. Given the ecological and commercial global importance of krill, this research helps inform current and future Southern Ocean krill management in the context of climate variability and change.																		2296-7745				JUN 15	2021	8								669508	10.3389/fmars.2021.669508							WOS:000663821600001						
J	Siegel, V				Siegel, V.			The Antarctic krill: resource and climate indicator, 35 years of German krill research	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ICHTHYOLOGY												P>In 1975/76, Germany resurrected its scientific interest in Antarctic marine biological research after it had ceased at the end of the 1930s. The first field campaign was carried out on board FRV 'Walther Herwig' (II) by the Federal Research Board of Fisheries in Hamburg in cooperation with the Institute of Marine Research at Kiel University. At that time the main objective was the search for freely accessible, and hardly exploited marine living resources. A commercial krill fishery had just started in the Antarctic, but was developing rapidly. Therefore, very soon it became necessary to integrate this research in international programmes. The multinational BIOMASS programme (Biological Investigations on Marine Antarctic Systems and Stocks) was founded in 1980. Its central focus was nothing less than to accomplish a first population census for krill in the South Atlantic.																	0175-8659					APR	2010	26			1			41	46		10.1111/j.1439-0426.2010.01445.x							WOS:000275761600008						
J	Newman, SJ; Dunlap, WC; Nicol, S; Ritz, D				Newman, SJ; Dunlap, WC; Nicol, S; Ritz, D			Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) acquire a UV-absorbing mycosporine-like amino acid from dietary algae	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY												We hypothesised that Antarctic krill acquire UV-absorbing mycosporine-like amino acids (MAAs) from dietary algae, which produce MAAs in response to ultraviolet (UV) irradiation. To test this hypothesis, we grew cultures of Phaeocystis antarctica that had been grown under either photosynthetically active radiation (PAR, 400-750 nm) plus UV irradiation (UVR, 280-400 nm), or else PAR-only. Algae grown under PAR-only produced high concentrations of porphyra-334, whereas additional UVR caused formation of high concentrations of mycosporine-glycine:valine and lower concentrations of porphyra-334. Krill were fed with either of these two cultures on eight occasions over 63 days. A third group was starved for the duration of the experiment. Animals were analysed after 36 and 63 days for MAA content. Remaining animals from all treatments were starved for a further 35 days and analysed to examine MAA retention characteristics. Our findings are that krill acquired different MAAs from dietary algae depending on the light conditions under which the algae were grown. Specifically, krill fed algae grown under PAR-only had higher concentrations of porphyra-334 than starved krill. Conversely, krill fed algae grown under PAR with additional WR had high body concentrations of mycosporine-glycine :valine. MAA concentrations in starved krill remained static throughout the experiment. However, long term starvation (35 days) caused levels of certain acquired MAAs to decline. From this we can infer that MAA concentrations in krill are dependent on the MAA content of phytoplankton, and therefore the algae's response to UV exposure. This has implications for transfer of MAAs through marine trophic webs. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science BN. All rights reserved.

J	Brown, M; Kawaguchi, S; Candy, S; Virtue, P				Brown, Matthew; Kawaguchi, So; Candy, Steven; Virtue, Patti			Temperature effects on the growth and maturation of Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba)	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY												This paper describes growth and maturation of individual Antarctic krill for a complete annual cycle in an artificially controlled environment. Antarctic krill were kept individually and maintained under temperature regimes of -1, 1 and 3 degrees C. while light conditions simulated natural seasonal conditions for the 14 months of the experiment starting in April. The growth increment (GI), instantaneous growth rate (IGR), daily growth rate (DGR), intermoult period (IMP) and maturity scores (MS) were tracked by measuring the consecutively moulted exoskeletons and modelled using linear mixed models (LMMs). There was a clear seasonal trend in growth and maturity in the three different temperature treatments. Males generally reached peak growth rates and matured earlier than females, but females showed higher growth rates overall. Negative growth occurred towards the end of January for both males and females, coinciding with the regression of external sexual characteristics. There was, as expected, a significant decline in IMP with increasing temperature, which was moderated by increasing trends with total length (TL) and month for the -1 degrees C treatment. For the 1 and 3 degrees C treatments there was no relationship with TL and the season effect declined after October and December, respectively. For krill with a TL of 40 mm in October, the predicted mean IMP values at -1, 1 and 3 degrees C were 28 days, 24 days and 19 days, respectively. There was some evidence to suggest that 1 degrees C was optimum for growth, as the IMP was significantly lower than at -1 degrees C but the difference in Cl between the two temperatures was not significantly different from zero, while all growth variables were significantly lower for the 3 compared to the -1 degrees C treatment. For the first time, this study has been able to confirm, by fitting a bivariate LMM, that compensation mechanisms do exist between IMP and IGR and to quantify the degree of compensation at both the between- and within-animal levels. This will allow modelling of growth trajectories in the wild to quantify the distribution of length given age. Crown Copyright (C) 2009 Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Moreover, the oxidation stability and in vitro release behavior of KYCs were evaluated. Results showed that KYCs provided significantly higher oxidative stability than native KO. The fatty acid profile remained obviously unchanged after encapsulation. Most interestingly, the phospholipid proportion increased from 49.76% +/- 1.42% to 59.92% +/- 1.39% after encapsulation. Furthermore, there was a slow and prolonged release of KYCs, along with higher bioaccessibility of docosahexaenoic acid and eicosapentaenoic acid than the KO-in-water emulsion (69.62% +/- 7.67% and 66.67% +/- 4.55% vs 47.44% +/- 4.4% and 39.74% +/- 3.89%). KO encapsulation in YCs can be considered as an efficient approach for extending the oxidative and in vitro stability of this nutritious oil and facilitating its application in food products.																	0308-8146	1873-7072				FEB 15	2021	338								128089	10.1016/j.foodchem.2020.128089							WOS:000580559700016	33091980					
J	CUZINROUDY, J; LABAT, JP				CUZINROUDY, J; LABAT, JP			EARLY SUMMER DISTRIBUTION OF ANTARCTIC KRILL SEXUAL DEVELOPMENT IN THE SCOTIA-WEDDELL REGION - A MULTIVARIATE APPROACH	POLAR BIOLOGY												The sexual Development of antarctic krill was studied during the EPOS leg 2 cruise (November 1988-January 1989) in the seasonally ice covered Scotia-Weddell Confluence area. Multiple Correspondence Analysis (MCA) was used to elucidate the general trends of variation of biological (body-size, molt stage) and environmental data (geographical position, sea-ice extension, sampling time) associated with female development. In November, female krill from the ice covered area (Weddell Sea) had a juvenile ovary, while pelagic female krill from Scotia Sea were in advanced previtellogenesis, and one third of them had already spawned. The successive samples from the Confluence illustrated a rapid advance of sexual development during the whole period. Both observation of live krill maintained on board and the MCA confirmed the general trend of distribution of sexual development in relation with size structure and environmental factors. Previtellogenesis occurs in relation with the ice-edge, while vitellogenesis is performed in short cycles in the summer pelagic habitat. The degree of sexual development attained by krill samples (measured by the sexual development index, SDI) is then a good indicator of the biological activity of the krill population and of its impact on the pelagic ecosystem.																	0722-4060					APR	1992	12	1					65	74									WOS:A1992HT73100008

In krill this involves partial digestion and resorption of the old exoskeleton and synthesis of new cuticle. Molecular events that underlie the moult cycle are poorly understood in calcifying crustaceans and even less so in non-calcifying organisms such as krill. To address this we constructed an Antarctic krill cDNA microarray in order to generate gene expression profiles across the moult cycle and identify possible activation pathways. Results: A total of 26 different cuticle genes were identified that showed differential gene expression across the moult cycle. Almost all cuticle genes were up regulated during premoult and down regulated during late intermoult. There were a number of transcripts with significant sequence homology to genes potentially involved in the synthesis, breakdown and resorption of chitin. During early premoult glutamine synthetase, a gene involved in generating an amino acid used in the synthesis of glucosamine, a constituent of chitin, was up regulated more than twofold. Mannosyltransferase 1, a member of the glycosyltransferase family of enzymes that includes chitin synthase was also up regulated during early premoult. Transcripts homologous to a beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase (beta-NAGase) precursor were expressed at a higher level during late intermoult (prior to apolysis) than during premoult. This observation coincided with the up regulation during late intermoult, of a coatomer subunit epsilon involved in the production of vesicles that maybe used to transport the beta-NAGase precursors into the exuvial cleft. Trypsin, known to activate the beta-NAGase precursor, was up regulated more than fourfold during premoult. The up regulation of a predicted oligopeptide transporter during premoult may allow the transport of chitin breakdown products across the newly synthesised epi- and exocuticle layers. Conclusion: We have identified many genes differentially expressed across the moult cycle of krill that correspond with known phenotypic structural changes. This study has provided a better understanding of the processes involved in krill moulting and how they may be controlled at the gene expression level.

Based on the random walk model, the relationship between distance and frequency distribution of adjacent fishing positions was analyzed by the Commission for Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR) Subareas 48.1, 48.2, and 48.3. The frequency of distances between consecutive hauls demonstrated a heavy-tailed distribution, which could be used to estimate the value of parameter mu in the power function F(l) similar to l(-mu) of a random walk model to determine the type of random walk patterns that characterize Chinese krill fishery. Results indicated that the fishing pattern of the Chinese krill fishery is consistent with the Levy random walk model, with which the step-length is applied to analyze the walking pattern. When a defined walk in a space of dimension is greater than one, the steps made are in isotropic random directions. Furthermore, a strong and positive correlation between fishing behavior (using the parameter mu as an indicator) and catch per unit effort of the Chinese krill fishery was observed.

J	Kirkwood, JM				Kirkwood, JM			The developmental rate of Euphausia crystallorophias larvae in Ellis Fjord, Vestfold Hills, Antarctica	POLAR BIOLOGY												Euphausia crystallorophias is the dominant zooplankton species in the neritic seas of Antarctica, where it occurs in similar abundances to those of Euphausia super bn in more offshore areas. Despite its great abundance and probable ecological significance, few details are known of this species' development, life history and ecology. This study found that E. crystallorophias spawned in Ellis Fjord from late November to early December and completed its larval development under the sea ice during the Antarctic winter. The mean time for E. crystallorophias eggs to develop to furcilia stage VI was 235.5 days, which is virtually identical to the developmental time already reported in the laboratory, but almost twice that of E. superba. This slow development rate is likely to be due either to the low water temperatures (< 0 degrees C) in which E. crystallorophias lives, or to low levels of food being available over winter.																	0722-4060					AUG	1996	16	7					527	530									WOS:A1996VC92500010

The considerations on the effective frequency for the acoustic survey of Antarctic krill, however, have not been sufficiently done. We examined the effective frequency for the acoustic survey from the vievvpoints of the variation of target strength (TS), the detection range, and the variation of absorption coefficient a. Although the variations of TS and a are the smallest for 38 kHz, this frequency is not effective because the detection range is especially small. The frequency of 200 kHz is not effective, because the variation of TS may be large. Therefore, the effective frequencies from the QES frequencies are 70 or 120 kHz; there are not serious problems for using both frequencies. This conclusion is desirable because the frequency of 120 kHz has been generally used for the acoustic surveys of Antarctic krill for a long time.																			0-7803-8669-8				2004							375	382									WOS:000227674100066						
J	BRINTON, E				BRINTON, E			DISTRIBUTION AND POPULATION STRUCTURES OF IMMATURE AND ADULT EUPHAUSIA-SUPERBA IN THE WESTERN BRANSFIELD STRAIT REGION DURING THE 1986-87 SUMMER	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART A-OCEANOGRAPHIC RESEARCH PAPERS												Interrelationships among body size, maturity state and spatial distribution in immature and adult Euphausia superba were examined through the course of the 1986-87 reproductive season in a region centered in western Bransfield Strait and extending northward into Drake Passage and southward into Gerlache Strait. During an initial (December to January) peak in production of phytoplankton and krill larvae in Gerlache Strait and adjacent parts of Bransfield Strait, so few post-larvae and adults were caught that the parent stock of those larvae could not be identified with certainty. However, small adults of 36-42 mm body length were caught in abundance later in the summer (February to March), after larval recruitment in and near Gerlache Strait had ceased. Many of these small adults then appeared to be post-reproductive. In Bransfield Strait during late summer (late February to March) there was a nearly equal mixture of small adults (which dominated in Gerlache Strait) and large adults (> 42 mm); the large adults showed most evidence of recent reproductive activity and could have been responsible for much of the late summer larval recruitment in Bransfield Strait. In Drake Passage, large adults were usually dominant; the few caught in December were undergoing maturation near the South Shetlands, and in January they were reproductive and dispersed in more offshore oceanic waters. During late February to March, krill became more available in Drake Passage with many having reassembled in aggregations near Livingston Island (South Shetlands). By then, not only small adults but also large adults appeared post-reproductive in all areas. Evidence relating to growth rate in adults was obscured by erratic variations in ratios of body-length classes, month-to-month, considered artifacts on sampling. However, adult growth appeared negligible during January to March. After midsummer (January) there were distinct changes in relative abundances of males to females of > 42 mm: within 43-47 mm the modal frequencies favored females, and within 48-55 mm males were dominant, suggesting differential survivorship. The Gerlache-Bransfield Straits and similar coastal habitats must be considered nursery areas, not only for immature krill as has been previously proposed, but also for early summer larvae. In particularly productive years, as in 1986-87, these coastal waters may become spawning localities for small adult krill before reproduction by large adults develops farther away from the Peninsula. Immatures of < 12 mm in December and ca 16-30 mm by March, comprised a subgroup of the smallest immature krill though not consistently abundant enough to be distinguished as a year class. Their distributions suggest origins and early growth outside of the study area, possibly in the Weddell Sea and coastal waters of the Bellingshausen Sea.																	0198-0149					AUG-SEP	1991	38	8-9					1169	1193		10.1016/0198-0149(91)90101-K							WOS:A1991GH34600013

Sea ice extent has been implicated as a major factor affecting reproductive success of krill and krill dispersal, but little is known of the way in which ice cover may influence krill behaviour. This is largely because the under-ice environment is difficult to study. Ship-borne echosounders have, however, detected krill aggregations in midwater in ice-covered regions. We used 120-kHz echograms collected underway during three cruises that crossed ice-covered and adjacent open waters in the Bellingshausen, Weddell, and Scotia seas to compare morphological and next-neighbour characteristics of krill swarms within and without ice cover. No significant differences were detected between the horizontal and vertical extent of swarms or swarm next-neighbour distance in ice-covered or open waters. Distributions of swarm mid-depths did, however, differ significantly between ice-covered and open areas in all three seas, although the direction of difference was not the same in each instance: swarms in the Weddell and Scotia seas were generally shallower under ice than in open water, whereas in the Bellingshausen Sea the opposite prevailed.

Simultaneous surveys of marine birds, Antarctic fur seals and Antarctic krill were conducted along a series of transects radiating from the breeding colonies of the vertebrate predators. We examined the relationships between the distributions of predators and their prey with respect to the abundance of krill in the water column and marine habitats near the colonies. Antarctic fur seals and macaroni penguins showed positive correlations with Antarctic krill density across a wide range of spatial scales. Because krill was abundant close to the colony and predator densities decreased with distance due to geometry, distance from colony was a confounding variable. When the influences of distance and direction on predator abundance were factored out, we were able to demonstrate an additional influence of Antarctic krill abundance at measurement scales between 10 and 100 km for Antarctic fur seals and for macaroni penguins at the scale of 70 to 100 km. Water depth was an important correlate of Antarctic krill and Antarctic fur seal abundances but not of the abundance of macaroni penguins. We found no evidence that the fur seals or macaroni penguins were concentrating their foraging for krill in the vicinity of the shelf-break.

Evaluating Antarctic marine protected area scenarios using a dynamic food web model	BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION												Marine protected areas, especially when they are or include no-take zones, can support conservation objectives by creating an area where marine organisms are protected from human disturbances, particularly fishing. The coast of the Antarctic continent is the only habitat of the iconic Adelie penguin, whose main diet is Antarctic krill. Current threats to Adelie Penguins, other Antarctic krill predators and Antarctic krill itself include sea-ice loss as a result of climate change and krill fishing. We use a spatially and temporally dynamic food web model of the region surrounding the Western Antarctic Peninsula to evaluate the potential impacts of various marine protected area scenarios in the context of climate change. We examine the effects of sustained sea-ice loss on krill and seven monitored krill predators. We evaluate four marine protected area scenarios given two scenarios that describe future changes in sea ice and three scenarios that describe future changes in krill fishing effort. Our results indicate that establishing no-take zones where krill might aggregate in the future and where some krill predators forage could positively affect biomass accumulation of krill and the predators. No-take zones may be particularly important for enhancing the resilience of species that have recently experienced population decline and ensuring positive outcomes from establishing a marine protected area in the region. Our simulations suggest that establishing protected areas in the right locations can play an important role in mitigating the negative effects of climate change on iconic species that many people want to conserve.				de Mutsert, Kim/AAV-1035-2020	de Mutsert, Kim/0000-0002-7902-3787												0006-3207	1873-2917				NOV	2020	251								108766	10.1016/j.biocon.2020.108766							WOS:000587339000012						
J	Jarman, SN; Nicol, S				Jarman, SN; Nicol, S			Sources of variance in studies of krill population genetics	CCAMLR SCIENCE												There has been a long-term interest in the population genetics of Antarctic krill species because of their ecological and economic importance. The possibility that there are distinct genetic stocks of these species would affect the design of management strategies for their conservation. A recent resurgence of interest in identifying distinct stocks of swarming krill species has been driven by the development of genetic technologies that are more sensitive to subtle population structure than older methods. Previous studies of the population genetics of the Antarctic species Euphausia crystallorophias and E. superba and the boreal species Meganyctiphanes norvegica that used allozymes found no evidence of genetic population structure. More recent investigations using sequence variation in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) have exposed genetic differentiation between samples taken from different parts of each species' range. However, the underlying assumption of these studies that differentiation between samples is caused primarily by restricted gene flow between widely separated sampling sites may be incorrect. Our recent study of E. crystallorophias mtDNA variation has indicated that there is significant genetic differentiation between samples taken within one region. This has important implications for the design of future studies of krill population genetics, which must be able to accommodate this sympatric variance component as well as variance attributable to differences between regions. Genetic differentiation between stocks of krill in different regions therefore can not be adequately assessed unless multiple samples are taken from each region.

Changes in krill population viability would have catastrophic effect on the Antarctic ecosystem. One looming threat due to elevated levels of anthropogenic atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) is ocean acidification (lowering of sea water pH by CO2 dissolving into the oceans). The genetics of Antarctic krill has long been of scientific interest for both for the analysis of population structure and analysis of functional genetics. However, the genetic resources available for the species are relatively modest. We have developed the most advanced genetic database on Euphausia superba, KriIIDB, which includes comprehensive data sets of former and present transcriptome projects. In particular, we have built a de novo transcriptome assembly using more than 360 million Illumina sequence reads generated from larval krill including individuals subjected to different CO2 levels. The database gives access to: 1) the full list of assembled genes and transcripts; 2) their level of similarity to transcripts and proteins from other species; 3) the predicted protein domains contained within each transcript; 4) their predicted GO terms; 5) the level of expression of each transcript in the different larval stages and CO2 treatments. All references to external entities (sequences, domains, GO terms) are equipped with a link to the appropriate source database. Moreover, the software implements a full-text search engine that makes it possible to submit free-form queries. KriIIDB represents the first largescale attempt at classifying and annotating the full krill transcriptome. For this reason, we believe it will constitute a cornerstone of future approaches devoted to physiological and molecular study of this key species in the Southern Ocean food web.

MARINE BIOLOGY												The Antarctic fur seal (Arctocephalus gazella) and macaroni penguin (Eudyptes chrysolophus) are sympatric top predators that occur in the Southern Ocean around South Georgia where they are, respectively, the main mammal and bird consumers of Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba). In recent years the population of fur seals has increased, whereas that of macaroni penguins has declined. Both species feed on krill of similar size ranges, dive to similar depths and are restricted in their foraging range at least while provisioning their offspring. In this study we test the hypothesis that the increased fur seal population at South Georgia may have resulted in greater competition for the prey of macaroni penguins, leading to the decline in their population. We used: (1) satellite-tracking data to investigate the spatial separation of the Bird Island populations of these two species whilst at sea during the breeding seasons of 1999 and 2000 and (2) diet data to assess potential changes in their trophic niches between 1989 and 2000. Foraging ranges of the two species showed considerable overlap in both years, but the concentrations of foraging activity were significantly segregated spatially. The size of krill taken by both species was very similar, but over the last 12 years the prevalence of krill in their diets has diverged, with nowadays less krill in the diet of macaroni penguins than in that of Antarctic fur seals. Despite a significant degree of segregation in spatial resource use by the study populations, it is likely that the South Georgia populations of Antarctic fur seal and macaroni penguin exploit the same krill population during their breeding season. For explaining the opposing population trends of the two species, the relative contributions of independent differential response to interannual variation in krill availability and of interspecies competition cannot be resolved with available evidence. The likely competitive advantage of Antarctic fur seals will be enhanced as their population continues to increase, particularly in years of krill scarcity.

J	Meyer, B; Oettl, B				Meyer, B; Oettl, B			Effects of short-term starvation on composition and metabolism of larval Antarctic krill Euphausia superba	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												Metabolic rates and elemental and biochemical composition of Furcilia IV (FIV) larvae of Euphausia superba were studied during 12 d of starvation at the onset of winter in the Bellings-hausen Sea. This time of the year may be a critical period in the krill life cycle because their larvae must switch from feeding on summer phytoplankton blooms to winter ice algae. FIV utilized mainly lipids overall, but also protein during the second half of the 12 d period. After 6 d of starvation most of the larvae lost half of their body C. Body lipid content decreased from 12.7 to 1.5 % of dry mass (DM), whereas protein fell from 32.7 to 25.8% of DM, Respiration rates decreased from 1.3 to 0.7-0.8 mu m O-2 (mg DM)(-1) h(-1) in the first 3 d, after which they remained roughly constant. These rates correspond to C losses of 2.7 and 2.0% body C d(-1) respectively. Excretion rates decreased from 0.04 to 0.02 mu g NH4 (mg DM)(-1) h(-1) until the middle of the starvation period and then rose to 0.05 mu g NH4 (mg DM)(-1) h(-1) by the end, which is probably related to the increase in protein breakdown. Based on these losses of body C and lipid, the FIV larvae may pass their point of no return, where they lose their ability to recover from nutritional stress, after 6 d.

C. wilsoni has been exploited on a commercial scale from the late 1970s to the end of the 1980s off Joinville-D'Urville Islands (CCAMLR Statistical Sub-area 48.1) and in the Cosmonauts and Cooperation Seas and Prydz Bay in the Indian Ocean sector (CCAMLR Statistical Division 58.4.2). This paper presents new information on biological features and life history characteristics of C. wilsoni, based on research survey collections along the northern Antarctic Peninsula in 2006 and 2007 and samples taken in the commercial fishery in 1987. Length frequency compositions from the research surveys demonstrated that fish 21-34 cm long predominated in the catches. Sexual maturity is attained at 24-25 cm. Absolute fecundity and relative fecundity is low (1,000-2,500 eggs; 6-12 eggs). Oocyte diameter varied from 4.0 to 4.9 mm very close to spawning. Spawning at the tip of the Antarctic Peninsula is likely to occur in October-November. Remotely operated vehicle deployments in the northern Weddell Sea demonstrated that C. wilsoni exhibit parental nest guarding where males protect the eggs. The incubation period is likely to be 8 months long. Fish feed primarily on Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) in the Antarctic Peninsula region and in the Cosmonauts and Cooperation Seas while fish take ice krill (Euphausia crystallorophias), Pleuragramma antarcticum and myctophids to some extent in other areas. Age determination still awaits validation. Preliminary ageing attempts suggested a maximum age of about 8-10 years.																	0722-4060					FEB	2008	31	3					381	393		10.1007/s00300-007-0366-z							WOS:000252193100013

Research on this species is of great value for exploitation of Antarctic biotic resources. In this study, the metabolomics of E. superba were investigated using the GC-MS method. A total of 293 compounds were initially identified; these compounds could be divided into several classes, including amino acids, sugars and polyols, metabolic intermediates, small molecules and other metabolites. However, a serious problem was that both 2-hydroxybiphenyl and dioctyl phthalate were also detected in these krill tissues. Moreover, some intermediates of pesticides and medicinal or chemical compound products were found in krill tissue as well. This is the first survey to investigate the occurrence of chemical contamination in metabolites of Antarctic krill. These findings suggest that international contracts or policies should be developed to protect the pristine ocean.																	0011-216X	1568-5403					2018	91	8					961	999		10.1163/15685403-00003801							WOS:000435492500004						
J	McCafferty, DJ; Boyd, IL; Walker, TR; Taylor, RI				McCafferty, DJ; Boyd, IL; Walker, TR; Taylor, RI			Foraging responses of Antarctic fur seals to changes in the marine environment	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												This study examined the relative contribution of environmental variation and the seasonal demands of pup rearing on the foraging behaviour of female Antarctic fur seals Arctocephalus gazella at Bird Island, South Georgia (54 degrees S, 38 degrees W), during 3 austral summers (1994 to 1996). Time-depth recorders measured the diving behaviour of 72 individuals during a total of 385 foraging trips totalling 1964 d at sea. The frequencies of krill, fish and squid in the diet were estimated from prey items contained in seats. In 1996, a year of high krill abundance, females made shorter foraging trips, fewer dives and spent more time ashore than in 1994 when krill was scarce. Females fed exclusively on krill in 1996, and frequent shallow daytime diving indicated that krill were close to the surface during the day. In 1994 and 1995 deeper and longer-duration daytime dives were associated with a higher proportion of fish and squid in the diet. Foraging trip duration, ashore duration and dive frequency increased through the course of the 1995 and 1996 lactation seasons. Females, therefore, appeared to match pup demands by increasing both time feeding at sea and energy delivery to the pup on land. However, the importance of sea surface temperature and duration of night in multiple regression models suggested that physical factors were also important in explaining the seasonal pattern of fur seal foraging behaviour.

Scaling of size, shape and surface roughness in Antarctic krill swarms	ICES JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE												Antarctic krill are obligate swarmers and the size and shape of the swarms they form can have a major influence on trophic interactions and biogeochemical fluxes. Parameterizing variability in size and shape is therefore a useful step toward understanding the operation of the Southern Ocean ecosystem. We analyse the relationships between the length L, thickness T, perimeter P, and area A of 4650 vertical cross-sections of open-ocean krill swarms obtained within the Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean in summer 2003. Our data show that these parameters are tightly interrelated. The thickness T increases on average as L0.67 and has a log-normal distribution within each length class. The perimeter and area scale with L and T as P similar to L0.77T and A similar to L0.86T0.48. The swarm aspect ratio, T/L, decreases approximately as L-0.32. The surface roughness (defined as P/A) has a weak dependence on swarm length and decreases approximately as T-0.46, which can be explained only by the appearance of indentations and cavities in the swarm shape. Overall, our study finds that there are distinct limits to the size and shape of swarms that Antarctic krill appear to be capable of forming and we explore the potential explanatory factors contributing to these limitations.

Antarctic krill oil (AKO) is rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids, which has various biological activities, such as improving insulin sensitivity, alleviating inflammation and ameliorating oxidative stress. In this study, the protective effect of AKO against AD were investigated in senescence-accelerated prone mouse strain 8 (SAMP8) mice. Results showed that treatment with AKO could effectively ameliorate learning and memory deficits and ease the anxiety in SAMP8 mice by Morris water maze, Barnes maze test and open-field test. Further analysis indicated that AKO might reduce -amyloid (A) accumulation in hippocampus through decreasing the contents of malondialdehyde (MDA) and 7,8-dihydro-8-oxoguanine (8-oxo-G), increasing the superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) activities in the brain of SAMP8 mice. Practical ApplicationThe results of Morris water maze, Barnes maze test and open-field test indicated that Antarctic krill oil (AKO) improved the cognitive function and anxiety of SAMP8 mice. AKO reduced the A(42) level in hippocampus of SAMP8 mice. AKO ameliorated oxidative stress in brain rather than in serum and liver of SAMP8 mice.				yuming, wang/K-8179-2012													0022-1147	1750-3841				FEB	2018	83	2					543	551		10.1111/1750-3841.14044							WOS:000424648000036	29350764

These experiments revealed high but variable release rates of dissolved material (carbon and nutrients), supplying, on average, 150 mmol dissolved organic carbon (DOC) m(-2) d(-1), which is comparable with that supported by phytoplankton. Krill support, on average, 73% of the combined krill + phytoplankton production of DOC in the ecosystem, implying the importance of krill in conditioning the productivity of the Southern Ocean. However, the contribution of krill as a source of DOC varied greatly because of the patchy distribution of both krill and primary producers in the region, ranging from 98% to 10% of the combined (krill + phytoplankton) DOC release rates. These results suggest that rapid decline in krill standing stocks associated with reduced ice cover may have major consequences for microbial communities in the ecosystem, since bacterial carbon demand often exceeds the DOC supplied by phytoplankton in coastal areas of the Southern Ocean, with potential unforeseen consequences in the carbon balance of the Southern Ocean.

Not only is it a significant grazer of phytoplankton, but it is also a major food item for charismatic megafauna such as whales and seals and an important Southern Ocean fisheries crop. Ecological data suggest that this species is being affected by climate change and this will have considerable consequences for the balance of the Southern Ocean ecosystem. Hence, understanding how this organism functions is a priority area and will provide fundamental data for life history studies, energy budget calculations and food web models. Methodology/Principal Findings: The assembly of the 454 transcriptome of E. superba resulted in 22,177 contigs with an average size of 492bp (ranging between 137 and 8515bp). In depth analysis of the data revealed an extensive catalogue of the cellular chaperone systems and the major antioxidant proteins. Full length sequences were characterised for the chaperones HSP70, HSP90 and the super-oxide dismutase antioxidants, with the discovery of potentially novel duplications of these genes. The sequence data contained 41,470 microsatellites and 17,776 Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs/INDELS), providing a resource for population and also gene function studies. Conclusions: This paper details the first 454 generated data for a pelagic Antarctic species or any pelagic crustacean globally. The classical "stress proteins'', such as HSP70, HSP90, ferritin and GST were all highly expressed. These genes were shown to be over expressed in the transcriptomes of Antarctic notothenioid fish and hypothesized as adaptations to living in the cold, with the associated problems of decreased protein folding efficiency and increased vulnerability to damage by reactive oxygen species. Hence, these data will provide a major resource for future physiological work on krill, but in particular a suite of "stress'' genes for studies understanding marine ectotherms' capacities to cope with environmental change.

These motivations have been proposed for schools of Antarctic krill, but little is known about their three-dimensional structure. Stereophotogrammetric images of Antarctic krill schooling in the laboratory are used to determine statistical distributions of swimming speed, nearest neighbor distance, and three-dimensional nearest neighbor positions. The krill schools swim at speeds of two body lengths per second at nearest neighbor distances of one body length and reach similarly high levels of organization as fish schools. The nearest neighbor position distribution is highly anisotropic and shows that Antarctic krill prefer to swim in the propulsion jet of their anterior neighbor. This position promotes communication and coordination among schoolmates via hydrodynamic signals within the pulsed jet created by the metachronal stroking of the neighboring krill's pleopods. The hydrodynamic communication channel therefore plays a large role in structuring the school. Further, Antarctic krill avoid having a nearest neighbor directly overhead, possibly to avoid blockage of overhead light needed for orientation. Other factors, including the elongated body shape of Antarctic krill and potential energy savings, also may help determine the three dimensional spatial structure of tightly packed krill schools.

Euphausia superba makes an abrupt behavioral transition after the last larval molt from an individualistic. planktonic lifestyle to that of a highly social, nektonic juvenile. Then and throughout the rest of its life, most aspects of krill behavior are expressed within the context of highly organized, polarized schools. A krill school is an integrated whole that displays properties greater than the sum of its parts. Emergent attributes of the aggregate evolve in response to a suite of positive and negative selective factors that act on entire schools as well as individuals. We evaluate the individual advantages and disadvantages of living within large schools of conspecific euphausiids primarily for foraging, antipredator behavior, and epidemiology. We review the history of research on krill behavior, comment on the current state of knowledge, and suggest new avenues for future investigations.																	0706-652X	1205-7533					2000	57			3			192	202		10.1139/cjfas-57-S3-192							WOS:000166531600017

A reported decline in energy storage over almost two decades indicates that food availability for the whales may also have declined recently. To test this hypothesis, catch data from 20 survey years in the Japanese Whale Research Program in the Antarctic (JARPA) and its second phase (JARPA II) (1990/91-2009/10), which covered the longitudinal sector between 35A degrees E and 145A degrees W south of 58A degrees S, were used to investigate whether there was any annual trend in the stomach contents weight of Antarctic minke whales. A linear mixed-effects analysis showed a 31 % (95 % CI 12.6-45.3 %) decrease in the weight of stomach contents over the 20 years since 1990/1991. A similar pattern of decrease was found in both males and females, except in the case of females sampled at higher latitude in the Ross Sea. These results suggest a decrease in the availability of krill for Antarctic minke whales in the lower latitudinal range of the research area. The results are consistent with the decline in energy storage reported previously. The decrease in krill availability could be due to environmental changes or to an increase in the abundance of other krill-feeding predators. The latter appears somewhat more likely, given the recent rapid recovery of humpback whale. Furthermore, humpback whales are not found in the Ross Sea, where both Antarctic krill and ice krill (Euphausia crystallorophias) are available, and where no change in prey availability for Antarctic minke whales is indicated.

Squid in the diet of Antarctic fur seals: potential links to oceanographic conditions and Antarctic krill abundance	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												Understanding how changes in oceanographic conditions affect predators and their prey is fundamental for interpreting variability in natural marine ecosystems. At South Georgia, Antarctic fur seals Arctocephalus gazella are known cephalopod predators and potential indicators of changes in regional environment conditions and prey availability. The cephalopod component of the diet of Antarctic fur seals at South Georgia was assessed using lower beaks found in scats collected over 5 consecutive years (2009-2013) under known variable oceanographic conditions. In years of unusually warm oceanographic conditions around South Georgia and low Antarctic krill Euphausia superba density, the number of squids Slosarczykovia circumantarctica increased in the seals' diet. Moreover, stable isotope analysis of beaks showed that S. circumantarctica exhibited higher delta N-15 values in years that were associated with an offshore habitat (lower delta C-13 values) where Antarctic fur seals had been foraging. This study provides evidence of the ecological links between the feeding behaviour of Antarctic fur seals, their main cephalopod prey, Antarctic krill densities and oceanographic conditions.

Growth and shrinkage in Antarctic krill Euphausia superba is sex-dependent	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												The ability of Antarctic krill Euphausia superba Dana to withstand the overwintering period is critical to their success. Laboratory evidence suggests that krill may shrink in body length during this time in response to the low availability of food. Nevertheless, verification that krill can shrink in the natural environment is lacking because winter data are difficult to obtain. One of the few sources of winter krill population data is from commercial vessels. We examined length-frequency data of adult krill (> 35 mm total body length) obtained from commercial vessels in the Scotia-Weddell region and compared our results with those obtained from a combination of science and commercial sampling operations carried out in this region at other times of the year. Our analyses revealed body-length shrinkage in adult females but not males during winter, based on both the tracking of modal size classes over seasons and sex-ratio patterns. Other explanatory factors, such as differential mortality, immigration and emigration, could not explain the observed differences. The same pattern was also observed at South Georgia and in the Western Antarctic Peninsula. Fitted seasonally modulated von Bertalanffy growth functions predicted a pattern of overwintering shrinkage in all body-length classes of females, but only stagnation in growth in males. This shrinkage most likely reflects morphometric changes resulting from the contraction of the ovaries and is not necessarily an outcome of winter hardship. The sex-dependent changes that we observed need to be incorporated into life cycle and population dynamic models of this species, particularly those used in managing the fishery.

J	Brierley, AS; Watkins, JL; Murray, AWA				Brierley, AS; Watkins, JL; Murray, AWA			Interannual variability in krill abundance at South Georgia	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												Interannual variability within the pelagic marine environment around South Georgia is a well-recognised phenomenon. A key aspect of this variability is interannual fluctuation in the abundance of Antarctic krill Euphausia superba. Here we describe a new acoustic survey programme to monitor krill abundance in the South Georgia region. We present biomass estimates for 2 survey boxes, located over the shelf-break to the northeast and northwest of the island, derived from the first of these surveys conducted in January 1996. We contrast these with the most recent previous estimates for the region obtained in January 1994. Weighted mean krill density (and weighted variances) estimates for the 1996 surveys were 40.57 g m(-2) (13.37) and 26.48 g m(-2) (54.30) for the eastern and western boxes respectively These are high compared with those obtained in January 1994, when estimates for similar areas were 1.87 g m(-2) (0.14) and 7.43 g m(-2) (1.33) respectively. The greater than 20-fold difference between surveys reveals a very large interannual variability in krill abundance at South Georgia. In 1994 the low abundance resulted in greatly reduced breeding success in most habitual krill predator species there. In the 1996 season, however, breeding success of these species was normal. Instantaneous estimates of krill abundance using acoustic techniques are therefore consistent with measurements from predators, whose breeding performances provide a longer-term indication of prey abundance in the surrounding pelagic ecosystem in a particular season.

An Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) hotspot: population characteristics, abundance and vertical structure explored from a krill fishing vessel	POLAR BIOLOGY												Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) aggregate in various ways depending on a range of biological and physical factors. In some areas, typically associated with bathymetric features such as shelf edges and canyons, they may aggregate densely to form hotspots. Despite the importance of such hotspots, their development over time in demographic composition and spatial distribution is not well understood. A fishing vessel during regular operation was used for collection of krill demographic and acoustic data on the shelf northwest of South Orkney Islands. Results show a decrease in the proportion of subadult males, partly reflected in an increase in mature adult males. Concurrently, there was a change in the proportion of males in the sampled population from 0.8 to 0.3, indicating immigration or emigration of krill through the hotspot. A clear trend was observed in the diurnal vertical distribution with deeper and more vertically compact swarms during the day. However, some days displayed very small differences between the day and night distribution and considerable variability in the daytime depth distribution. It was noted that although fishing was carried out during the entire period of the study, there was no obvious trend in the acoustic backscatter, suggesting that the overall krill density was not changing during this period. Using a fishing vessel as a research platform has advantages for understanding the dynamics of the fishery and in quantifying biological and physical processes during actual exploitation of these resources.

To shorten thawing time, the effects of salt, sucrose and moisture contents on dielectric properties at 915 and 2450MHz were also studied during microwave thawing (MT) and microwave heating (MH). The results indicate that the change in sucrose content had a smaller effect on dielectric properties, and only addition of salt had a significant influence (p < 0.05) on dielectric properties during MT. Moreover, when these shrimps with addition of a salt-sucrose mixture at 3% w/w were thawed and heated to 20 degrees C, the microwave processing time was no more than 130 s. Compared with the samples without any additives, thawing time shortened significantly when salt and sucrose were simultaneously added to the samples. Besides, the centre temperature and temperature distribution within the cross section of shrimps confirmed effects of various additives on dielectric properties, suggesting that MT and MH can be applied to the processing of freshwater and oceanic shrimp, and that addition of only salt or the salt-sucrose mixture can further quicken thawing and heating rates to optimize the industrial processing of shrimp.																	0832-7823						2017	51	1					3	30		10.1080/08327823.2017.1291067							WOS:000399572200002

Commercial fishing operations concentrated on the outer shelf in the early 1980s, along the shelf slope in the mid to late 1980s, and from the shelf across to the outer shelf in the early to late 1990s. Intra-annually, trawling positions generally started from the outer shelf and proceeded towards the shelf later in the season. Trawling positions seemed to be primarily governed by the distribution of larger mature krill, especially at the beginning of fishing operations each season. In summer, biological factors that affect product quality, such as salp abundance and the proportion of green krill, also seemed to have an increasing effect on trawling positions. Ice conditions for recent fishing periods were also demonstrated to have an effect.

Analyses of acoustic observations revealed distinct seasonal variations in estimates of krill abundance, the dimensional parameters used to characterize individual krill aggregations, the geographic area over which krill were acoustically detected, and the depth distribution of krill biomass. Spatially averaged estimates of krill biomass were an order of magnitude higher in spring (32 g m(-2)) and summer (95 g m(-2)) compared to fall (12 g m(-2)) and winter (8 g m(-2)). In summer, krill were detected throughout the region and most of the krill biomass was associated with aggregations of small cross-sectional area (< 2000 m(2)) and high mean biomass (> 150 g m(-3)), which were positioned in the upper 50 m of the water column. Winter observations, in contrast, were characterized by the absence of krill throughout most of the region and aggregations occurring deeper than 100 m with large cross-sectional area (>10000 m(2)) and low mean biomass (<10 g m(-3)). Two features common to all seasons were the presence of higher krill biomass (> 50 g m(-2)) at selected locations on the inner shelf and the disproportionate contribution, in terms of total krill biomass (>80%), by a small number of aggregations (<20%). The length frequency distributions of krill collected by nets showed an across-shelf pattern of larger (>40 mm) krill positioned offshore of smaller krill (32-38 mm) in all seasons except winter. Synthesis of these data and historical observations suggest that there is a seasonal shift in the primary habitat of krill and that changes in krill behavior are an important factor affecting variations in krill distributions.

Two bacterial cultures were isolated and tested for the degradation of krill shell waste. According to the morphological examination, physiological tests, and applied molecular techniques conducted, isolates were identified as Bacillus subtilis and Lactobacillus plantarum. At a temperature of 37 degrees C, both strains were cultivated separately in flasks containing krill shell waste. At determined periods of time, deproteinization and demineralization of residuals were measured. For deproteinization tests, the liquid phase fermentation of krill shell waste showed protein removal of 88.9% after 60 h. For demineralization tests, the liquid phase fermentation of krill shell waste showed calcium carbonate removal of 84.6% after 72 h. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) analysis of chitin prepared by the process was carried out and compared with spectra of samples treated by strong acids and bases.																	1049-8850	1547-0636					2017	26	10					1210	1220		10.1080/10498850.2015.1094686							WOS:000419358200011

Average element abundances (in parentheses) in mu/g, in descending order, were as follows: P(9940), Cu (80.5), Zn (43.5), Fe (28.0), Se (5.80), Ba (3.78), Mn (1.98), As (1.92), Ag (1.71), Ni (0.54), Cr (0.30), Cd (0.29), Pb (0.22), and Hg (0.025). Inverse relationships were found between krill length and Hg concentration as well as between As and P levels. A geographic trend of increasing Mn and P levels from southwest to northeast along the Antarctic Peninsula was found. Results were compared to earlier data for evidence of metal concentration changes due to anthropogenic activity over the last 15 years.																	0722-4060					APR	1995	15	4					283	288									WOS:A1995QV57000007

Lipid composition of the body and digestive gland of Euphausia superba in controlled conditions	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												To examine the potential of lipids as dietary markers in Euphausia superba Dana, juvenile krill were fed 4 phytoplankton diets (diatoms, cryptomonads, dinoflagellates and thraustochytrids over a range of food concentrations) and 2 species of zooplankton (rotifers and Artemia sp.) for 20 d. Lipid content, lipid class and fatty acid (FA) composition were analysed for whole krill and digestive glands (DG). Changes detected in whole krill were almost entirely associated with the lipid variability observed in DG. With marked diet-induced changes, DG lipids were the major repository for the trophic signal in krill. DG lipid content increased in krill fed on phytoplankton due to the accumulation of polar lipid (0.5 mg per DG) and triacylglycerol (up to 1.7 mg per DG). Herbivorous diets induced distinct FA signatures in the DG, characterised by higher proportions of: 16:1 omega 7 and 20:5 omega 3 in diatom-fed krill; 18:1 omega 9 and 18:4 omega 3 in cryptomonad-fed krill; 18:1 omega 9, 18A omega 3 + 18:5 omega 3 and 22:6 omega 3 in dinoflagellate-fed krill; and 14:0 and 22:6 omega 3 in thraustochytrid-fed krill. Dietary FA markers increased in relative proportion (% total FA) in the DG with increasing concentration of each particular food. Krill fed rotifers or Artemia sp. showed relatively low DG lipid content, with only slightly higher proportions of 18:2 omega 6 than observed with phytoplankton diets. Zooplankton diets induced no significant difference in FA composition in relation to the species of zooplankton used as prey or to the algal type consumed by these prey.

Seabed foraging by Antarctic krill: Implications for stock assessment, bentho-pelagic coupling, and the vertical transfer of iron	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												A compilation of more than 30 studies shows that adult Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) may frequent benthic habitats year-round, in shelf as well as oceanic waters and throughout their circumpolar range. Net and acoustic data from the Scotia Sea show that in summer 2-20% of the population reside at depths between 200 and 2000 m, and that large aggregations can form above the seabed. Local differences in the vertical distribution of krill indicate that reduced feeding success in surface waters, either due to predator encounter or food shortage, might initiate such deep migrations and results in benthic feeding. Fatty acid and microscopic analyses of stomach content confirm two different foraging habitats for Antarctic krill: the upper ocean, where fresh phytoplankton is the main food source, and deeper water or the seabed, where detritus and copepods are consumed. Krill caught in upper waters retain signals of benthic feeding, suggesting frequent and dynamic exchange between surface and seabed. Krill contained up to 260 nmol iron per stomach when returning from seabed feeding. About 5% of this iron is labile, i.e., potentially available to phytoplankton. Due to their large biomass, frequent benthic feeding, and acidic digestion of particulate iron, krill might facilitate an input of new iron to Southern Ocean surface waters. Deep migrations and foraging at the seabed are significant parts of krill ecology, and the vertical fluxes involved in this behavior are important for the coupling of benthic and pelagic food webs and their elemental repositories.

Size Selection of Antarctic Krill (Euphausia superba) in Trawls	PLOS ONE												Trawlers involved in the Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) fishery use different trawl designs, and very little is known about the size selectivity of the various gears. Size selectivity quantifies a given trawl's ability to catch different sizes of a harvested entity, and this information is crucial for the management of a sustainable fishery. We established a morphological description of krill and used it in a mathematical model (FISHSELECT) to predict the selective potential of diamond meshes measuring 5-40 mm with mesh opening angles (oa) ranging from 10 to 90 degrees. We expected the majority of krill to encounter the trawl netting in random orientations due to high towing speeds and the assumed swimming capabilities of krill. However, our results indicated that size selectivity of krill is a well-defined process in which individuals encounter meshes at an optimal orientation for escapement. The simulation-based results were supported by data from experimental trawl hauls and underwater video images of the mesh geometry during fishing. Herein we present predictions for the size selectivity of a range of netting configurations relevant to the krill fishery. The methods developed and results described are important tools for selecting optimal trawl designs for krill fishing.

Modelling the effects of UV radiation on the survival of Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba Dana) in the face of limited data	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING												Antarctic krill, Euphausia superba, is a keystone species of the Antarctic ecosystem. A fishery for krill may compete with land-based predators (penguins and seals), particularly during the breeding season. The Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR) is moving towards management in small scale units. The management models specify predation and fishing mortality as space and time dependent but do not yet include non-predation natural mortality. Krill are known to be highly susceptible to ultraviolet radiation (UV) but there are limited empirical data. We develop a model for krill mortality caused by UV and parameterize and assess it by comparison with experimental data. The analysis allows us to identify key parameters that should be measured in future experiments and also leads to suggestions about modification of experimental procedure. We illustrate the method for krill found in the Livingston Island area and show that (a) it is possible to estimate the component of natural mortality due to UV-induced damage and (b) that cohorts born in 1979, 1984, or 1997 have different survival in the first 5 years of life, associated with differential UV exposure. In particular, those born in 1997 may have experienced as much as 10% lower survival than those born in 1979. The method developed here allows a potentially important source of krill mortality to be incorporated into the management models and suggests key experiments and field work in the future.

We quantified albatross foraging behaviour both from ships using binoculars and from land using satellite-tracked transmitters. Black-browed Albatrosses changed their movement behaviour in the vicinity of krill swarms whereas Grey-headed Albatrosses did not. We compared the patterns of population dispersal of both species around South Georgia in three years of very different krill abundance. In 1994, a year of exceptional krill scarcity, Black-browed but not Grey-headed, Albatrosses dispersed much farther offshore than during either 1986 or 1993, years of plentiful krill. The tendency for Black-browed Albatrosses to disperse farther offshore when krill was scarce was confirmed both by satellite tracking and by offshore surveys of population distribution.																	0373-2266						1997	85	1					129	134									WOS:A1997XZ41200012

Role of krill versus bottom-up factors in controlling phytoplankton biomass in the northern Antarctic waters of South Georgia	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												The extent to which Antarctic phytoplankton stocks are controlled by 'bottom-up' and/or 'top-down' factors is highly variable. Here we consider data collected at South Georgia during 3 summer surveys that recorded substantial hydrographic variability. A suite of bottom-up and top-down controlling factors were measured simultaneously at the mesoscale. Sea surface temperature varied by >2 degrees C, macronutrients ranged from near-winter concentrations to near-depleted, while mean densities of a major grazer, krill Euphausia superba, varied between near-zero and >400 g wet mass m(-2). A general linear model was used to identify the main factors implicated in the observed differences in phytoplankton biomass. Despite east-to-west and on- to off-shelf temperature gradients, temperature per se was not implicated in phytoplankton variability. Also, while there was an abundance of NO3-N in surface waters, NH4-N was the key nutrient throughout. A domed relationship between phytoplankton and krill peaked between 2 and 4 mg chlorophyll a m(-3) and 6 and 30 g krill m(-2). The positive side of this dome was represented by the west off-shelf region downstream of South Georgia. Here, an ample supply of micro- and macronutrients promoted high primary production, and low densities of krill presumably had little grazing effect, This positive relationship between krill and phytoplankton biomasses was interpreted as krill accumulating in areas of good feeding conditions. The negative side of the dome was typified by the east off-shelf region, where macronutrients remained high, primary production rates were low, and krill densities were very high. The grazing rates calculated here suggested that krill affect their food stocks severely, and the negative krill-phytoplankton relationship in this region may reflect locally high krill densities driving down their food supply.

The total fishing effort from 1977 to 1991 was 50 086 vessel-days fished, in Subareas 48.3 (45% of the total for the period), 48.2 (36%) and 48.1 (19%). Three distinct patterns in the distribution of monthly fishing effort between subareas were recognised: Type I covered the period 1981-1982, Type II 1983-1986 and Type III 1987-1988. It is likely that environmental conditions and operational constraints influenced the distribution of fishing effort. The three types of distribution correspond to the spatial and temporal variability of the meridional atmospheric processes. Retrospective data analyses show that the fishing effort is most intense in the subarea where air transfer from the south is greatest. The phenomenon occurs in Subareas 48.1 and 48.2 under conditions of increased westward component of the zonal air exchange and in Subarea 48.3 of decreased westward component.																	1023-4063						2003	10						1	13									WOS:000188512300001

Detailed studies of immobilization were performed, and PLAT was immobilized by physical adsorption onto DA -201. The best conditions for adsorption were as follows: protein loading= 85 mg PLAT /g support at a pH of 5 with 10 h of contact. For synthesis of PC with high levels of DHA, the effects of several parameters, including pressure, reaction time, temperature, enzyme loading and substrate molar ratio, were investigated to determine optimal conditions.

However, the molecular mechanisms generating these rhythms remain far from understood. The aim of this study was to investigate seasonal differences in gene expression in three different latitudinal regions (South Georgia, South Orkneys/Bransfield Strait, Lazarev Sea) and to identify genes with potential regulatory roles in the seasonal life cycle of Antarctic krill. The RNA-seq data were analysed (a) for seasonal differences between summer and winter krill sampled from each region, and (b) for regional differences within each season. A large majority of genes showed an up-regulation in summer krill in all regions with respect to winter krill. However, seasonal differences in gene expression were less pronounced in Antarctic krill from South Georgia, most likely due to the milder seasonal conditions of the lower latitudes of this region, with a less extreme light regime and food availability between summer and winter. Our results suggest that in the South Orkneys/Bransfield Strait and Lazarev Sea region, Antarctic krill entered a state of metabolic depression and regressed development (winter quiescence) in winter. Moreover, seasonal gene expression signatures seem to be driven by a photoperiodic timing system that may adapt the flexible behaviour and physiology of Antarctic krill to the highly seasonal environment according to the latitudinal region. However, at the lower latitude South Georgia region, food availability might represent the main environmental cue influencing seasonal physiology.

ESTIMATING OPTIMAL OBSERVER COVERAGE IN THE ANTARCTIC KRILL FISHERY	CCAMLR SCIENCE												Data collected as part of the CCAMLR Scheme of International Scientific Observation from conventional krill trawl vessels fishing in South Georgia (CCAMLR Subarea 48.3) were analysed using variance components analysis (VCA) to determine the relationship between observer coverage and our ability to reliably estimate parameters of interest, in this case the mean (or median) krill length and the rate of larval fish by-catch. A partial coverage sampling program has been implemented in South Georgia since 2002: observers have been placed on approximately 50% of vessels fishing in any one season, and have been present on board for about 30% of that season. They have achieved a rate of krill sampling equivalent to 18% of total hauls per vessel per season and 31% per vessel per season for larval fish. Between-vessel and between-haul variance was estimated. For krill mean length and larval fish by-catch rate, between-vessel variance (about 45% of total variance) was slightly lower than between-haul variance. However, the ratio is sufficiently close to 50% that sampling needs to be efficient at both vessel and haul level. It is proposed that an efficient sampling proportion, at least for South Georgia, should be >50% of vessels sampled each season, 20% of total season hauls sampled for krill and an equivalent or higher sampling proportion for larval fish. The Scientific Committee's method of systematic partial coverage appears to have been sufficient in South Georgia to determine appropriate coverage levels in that fishery. The South Georgia data suggest that such strategies should be pursued for at least four years before the Scientific Committee will have sufficient data to determine appropriate sampling strategies in a particular area.																	1023-4063						2010	17						139	154									WOS:000208409700007

The results showed that the population was heterogeneous with respect to size and maturity, with small immature krill found primarily inside the Bransfield Strait and large mature krill mainly north of the South Shetland Islands. Multivariate analysis of hydrographic data collected at the same stations revealed that the oceanography corresponded to previous classifications of the area, with Weddell Sea water in the southeast and east and South East Pacific water in the northwest. Further multivariate analysis using both krill variability and hydrographic data showed that a strong correlation existed between the krill distribution and the oceanography. Several hypotheses to explain the observed distribution of krill are discussed. It is judged that neither simple processes, such as growth during the sampling period, nor processes whereby krill are advected passively through the area by water movement, can completely explain the observed distribution. Instead, it is concluded that the observed gradient of krill size and maturity probably arises, at least in part, from an active ontogenetic migration.																	0171-8630					AUG	1993	98	1-2					61	71		10.3354/meps098061							WOS:A1993LT15100006

Stenotrophomonas maltophilia FF11, isolated from frozen Antarctic krill, grows at a wide range of temperatures and secretes more proteases at low temperatures. According to zymogram analysis, two kinds of proteases were produced from this strain. A major protease was produced largely at 15 A degrees C, but not at 37 A degrees C. The temperature-dependent secreted protease was purified to homogeneity. Its molecular mass was determined at 37.4 kDa and its amino acid sequence was also obtained. This protease is a member of the subtilase group according to the NCBI blast analysis. The enzyme was highly stable at high salt concentration (4 M). Interestingly, its activity increased about 1.6-fold under high salt condition. The enzyme remains active and stable in different organic solvents (50 %, v/v) such as dimethylsulfoxide, dimethyl formamide, dioxane and acetone. These properties may provide potential applications in quality control for sea foods, in protein degradation at high salt concentration, in biocatalysis and biotransformation within non-aqueous media, such as detergent and transesterification.																	1367-5435	1476-5535				JUN	2016	43	6					829	840		10.1007/s10295-016-1749-3							WOS:000376930500010	27001262

The glacially sculpted coastline along the peninsula is highly convoluted and characterized by deep embayments that are often interconnected by channels that facilitate transport of heat and nutrients into the shelf domain. The ecosystem is divided into three subregions, the continental slope, shelf and coastal regions, each with unique ocean dynamics, water mass and biological distributions. The WAP shelf lies within the Antarctic Sea Ice Zone (SIZ) and like other SIZs, the WAP system is very productive, supporting large stocks of marine mammals, birds and the Antarctic krill, Euphausia superba. Ecosystem dynamics is dominated by the seasonal and interannual variation in sea ice extent and retreat. The Antarctic Peninsula is one among the most rapidly warming regions on Earth, having experienced a 2 degrees C increase in the annual mean temperature and a 6 degrees C rise in the mean winter temperature since 1950. Delivery of heat from the Antarctic Circumpolar Current has increased significantly in the past decade, sufficient to drive to a 0.6 degrees C warming of the upper 300 m of shelf water. In the past 50 years and continuing in the twenty-first century, the warm, moist maritime climate of the northern WAP has been migrating south, displacing the once dominant cold, dry continental Antarctic climate and causing multi-level responses in the marine ecosystem. Ecosystem responses to the regional warming include increased heat transport, decreased sea ice extent and duration, local declines in ice-dependent Adelie penguins, increase in ice-tolerant gentoo and chinstrap penguins, alterations in phytoplankton and zooplankton community composition and changes in krill recruitment, abundance and availability to predators. The climate/ecological gradients extending along the WAP and the presence of monitoring systems, field stations and long-term research programmes make the region an invaluable observatory of climate change and marine ecosystem response.

J	Demer, DA; Conti, SG				Demer, DA; Conti, SG			New target-strength model indicates more krill in the Southern Ocean	ICES JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE												Antarctic krill, Eaphausia superba, comprises the foundation of the foodweb in the Southern Ocean and is the target of a large fishery. Recently, the total abundance of krill in the Scotia Sea was estimated from an international echosounder and net survey (CCAMLR 2000) to be 44.3 million metric tonnes (Mt; CV 11.4%) (Hewitt et al., 2002). The new biomass estimate prompted the Antarctic Treaty's Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR) to revise the precautionary catch level for krill in the area from 1.5 to 4 Mt (SC-CAMLR, 2000). These survey results are based on the total echo energy attributed to krill, scaled by the Greene et al. (1991) model of krill acoustical reflectivity or target strength (TS). Presented here is a re-analysis of the CCAMLR 2000 data incorporating recent improvements in the characterization of krill TS. The results indicate that the estimated krill biomass in the Scotia Sea may be as high as 192.4 Mt (CV = 11.7%), or as low as 109.4 Mt (CV = 10.4%), depending solely on the expected distribution of krill orientations. The new Stochastic, Distorted-Wave, Born-Approximation (SDWBA) TS model solved with an empirically estimated distribution of in situ orientations leads to a krill-biomass estimate that is nearly 2.5 times the previous estimate. In consequence, revisions may be warranted of the standard krill TS model, the CCAMLR 2000 biomass estimate, and the associated precautionary catch level for krill in the Scotia Sea.

The enzymatic resistance and transport of DTDSEEEIR-iron during gastrointestinal digestion and absorption as well as the relationship between the DTDSEEEIR stability and the enhancement of iron absorption were further explored. Results revealed that iron ions spontaneously bound to the carboxyl, hydroxyl, and amino groups of the DTDSEEEIR peptide, which induced the folding of DTDSEEEIR to form a more orderly structure. The DTDSEEEIR peptide remained stable to a certain extent (79.60 +/- 0.19%) after gastrointestinal digestion and the coordination of iron improved the digestive stability of the DTDSEEEIR peptide (93.89 +/- 1.37%). Moreover, the stability of DTDSEEEIR across intestinal epithelium had a positive effect on iron absorption, which implied that DTDSEEEIR might carry iron ions through intestinal epithelial cells.																	0021-8561	1520-5118				OCT 7	2020	68	40					11290	11300		10.1021/acs.jafc.0c03223							WOS:000580512000025	32914618					
J	Santa Cruz, F; Ernst, B; Arata, JA; Parada, C				Santa Cruz, Francisco; Ernst, Billy; Arata, Javier A.; Parada, Carolina			Spatial and temporal dynamics of the Antarctic krill fishery in fishing hotspots in the Bransfield Strait and South Shetland Islands	FISHERIES RESEARCH												Antarctic krill is a vital part of the food web and supports a significant fishery in the Southern Ocean. Shifts in historical fishing grounds and spatial distribution of catches have occurred as a result of recent changes in fishery practices. To understand these shifts, fishery spatial dynamics and fishing fleet behavior evaluated on different spatial and temporal scales are critical. We examine the catch distribution on three spatial-temporal scales. At the Western Antarctic Peninsula (WAP) scale, we assessed the fleet's southward expansion, identifying the Bransfield Strait (BS) as the main current fishing ground, replacing the historical Drake sector. At the BS scale, we identified fishing hotspots (FHs) that concentrated 48%-57% of the total catch over a period of 2-6 months and had high catch densities (2.2-30.3 ton km(-2)). At the FH scale, we tracked the spatial distribution of the fleet within FHs, demonstrating a shift of fishing vessels to contiguous zones as a result of a decrease in daily catch rates (CPUE). Such shifts (allowing the fleet to increase CPUE) occurred every 4-17 days. Previously exploited fishing grounds were revisited based on FH persistence and sea ice conditions. This paper concludes with a discussion of the potential impact of fishing fleet behavior and catch concentration, considering the recent spatial shift towards less-exploited areas, the overlap with critical zones for predator feeding, and several implications for fisheries management.

Here, we compare biomass, growth and production of Euphausia superba (Antarctic krill) and the copepod Calanoides acutus at South Georgia, in the Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean. Average acoustically derived krill biomass across the 5 study years was 2.6 g C m(-2), 4 to 5 times that of Stages CIV and CV of C. acutus. Mean length of krill was 41 +/- 4 mm, and the average growth rate was 0.10 mm d(-1), giving an average mass-specific growth rate of 0.0084 d(-1). This equated to a daily gross production of krill of 0.022 g C m(-2) d(-1). Gross production of Stages CIV and CV of C. acutus was similar, around 0.026 g C m(-2) d-1. These stages of C. acutus represent about 25% of the total copepod biomass around South Georgia, so total copepod production here may exceed that of krill by a factor of 4 during the productive summer months. Biomass of copepods and krill in other parts of the Southern Ocean differ by similar orders of magnitude, whilst growth rates are likely to remain within the range measured in this study. Therefore, our finding has relevance outside the local South Georgia system. All of the krill production is likely to be rapidly consumed by higher predators within the surface layers, whilst it is estimated that around 17% of copepod production may be sequestered at depth during winter diapause.																	0171-8630	1616-1599					2005	298						229	239		10.3354/meps298229							WOS:000231905600020

Variations in proteins and nutritional properties of the FKPC were analyzed. Gel electrophoresis analysis indicated that some variations in protein composition were introduced by autolysis and pH shift during the process of isoelectric precipitation and fluoride removal. The FKPC was composed of 81.01% +/- 0.45% crude protein (dry basis) and 16.78% +/- 0.26% total lipid (dry basis), exhibited excellent amino-acid composition in all the essential amino acids, exceeding the requirements of the FAO/WHO/UNU for food protein, and was rich in omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, especially eicosapentaenoic (EPA) and docosahexaenoic (DHA) acids present in phospholipids. The fluoride level of FKPC was 79.79 +/- 2.10 g/g (dry basis), which met the USFDA requirements. The surimi yield reached 43.74%, and the mean recovery rate of protein and fat was 52.68% and 41.44%, respectively. The nutritional value, safe level of fluoride, and high yield rate provide evidence that FKPC has a promising future in the food industry as a new aquatic protein and lipid resource.																	1049-8850	1547-0636					2017	26	8					958	968		10.1080/10498850.2017.1364315							WOS:000414077600008

Seasonal and spatial influences on gene expression in Antarctic krill Euphausia superba	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												The high latitudes inhabited by Antarctic krill Euphausia superba Dana are characterised by extreme changes in seasonal conditions, with very low food availability, long periods of darkness and a massive expansion of sea ice in autumn and winter. How krill adapt to these conditions has yet to be determined, and it was the purpose of this study to gain more insight by investigating the differences between summer and winter krill populations at the molecular level. To achieve this, we used a cDNA microarray to compare gene expression between female adult krill caught during summer and winter near the Antarctic Peninsula (60 degrees S), and between Peninsula krill and krill caught near South Georgia (54 degrees S) during the same winter. The Peninsula seasonal comparison showed up-regulation in summer krill of genes involved in feeding and digestion, respiration, motor activity and immunity. Summer krill also showed evidence of increased vitellogenesis, with an insulin-related peptide up-regulated and neuroparsin down-regulated. The comparison between the different overwintering locations showed an up-regulation in the South Georgia krill of genes involved in feeding and digestion, and immunity. There was, however, no differential expression of genes involved in respiration, motor activity or vitellogenesis, suggesting that despite the above differences, both populations of overwintering krill were in a quiescent state. This study shows how krill physiology changes seasonally at the molecular level and how these changes are flexible according to the overwintering environment.

Future ocean and sea-ice changes affecting the distribution of such species will impact the structure and functioning of whole ecosystems. Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) is a key species in Southern Ocean food webs, but there is little understanding of the factors influencing its success throughout much of the ocean. The capacity of a habitat to maintain growth will be crucial and here we use an empirical relationship of growth rate to assess seasonal spatial variability. Over much of the ocean, potential for growth is limited, with three restricted oceanic regions where seasonal conditions permit high growth rates, and only a few areas around the Scotia Sea and Antarctic Peninsula suitable for growth of the largest krill (> 60 mm). Our study demonstrates that projections of impacts of future change need to account for spatial and seasonal variability of key ecological processes within ocean ecosystems.

The surveys were the first in a newly planned five-year series of observations designed to complement and extend an existing time series regularly maintained by the British Antarctic Survey since 1996 (and on a more ad hoc basis since the early 1980s). We hoped that conducting several surveys in one season would provide information on short-term variability that could be used to set data from more restricted once-per-season 'snap-shot' cruises in a broader context. The early- and late-season surveys were associated with logistic support voyages to South Georgia and were restricted to four transects within a box to the northwest of South Georgia. The dedicated mid-season survey covered that box in more detail (twice as many transects) and, in addition, examined boxes to the north, northeast and southwest of the island. Together these surveys provided temporally and spatially extensive coverage around South Georgia. Krill density in the western box in the early-season survey was very low (3.5 g m(-2)) but rose significantly (P = 0.020) by mid-season (to 34.7 g m(-2)). In a pattern that is consistent with observations from previous years, krill density in the western box in the mid-season survey was less than that in the eastern box (80.4 g m(-2)). Analysis of transect data obtained in the western box in the mid-season survey revealed no significant difference in the mean krill density derived from only those four transects surveyed early- and late-season, or from the full eight transects. Our first occupation of a survey box off the central north coast of South Georgia in mid-season revealed a krill density of 47.2 g m(-2) that was intermediate between the eastern and western areas. The size structure of the krill in the central region also reflected a mix of those to the east (generally small) and west (generally large). Krill density to the southwest of South Georgia was 32.1 g m(-2) in mid-season. By March, krill density in the western survey area had fallen significantly (P = 0.037) from the mid-season high to 7.8 g m(-2). Our multiple surveys at South Georgia have revealed major intra-annual changes in krill density at the island and have shown that the timing of the acoustic survey can affect significantly the estimate of krill density. The multiple estimates of krill density will allow reproductive performance indices for top level predators to be compared to prey availability at more appropriate time-scales than previous single 'snap-shot' acoustic survey data have allowed. This is a crucial step in the elucidation of response functions of dependent species to changes in krill abundance, and could be a useful contribution to ecosystem management.

Internal physiology of live krill revealed using new aquaria techniques and mixed optical microscopy and optical coherence tomography ( OCT) imaging techniques	MARINE AND FRESHWATER BEHAVIOUR AND PHYSIOLOGY												The accurate observation of physiological changes on in vivo samples of important animal species such as Euphausia superba (Antarctic krill) is an important goal in helping to understand how environmental changes can affect animal development. Using a custom made krill trap', live un-anaesthetized krill were confined for seven hours, during which three hours of optical imaging were obtained and no subsequent ill effects observed. The trap enabled two imaging methods to be employed: optical coherence tomography (OCT) and microscopy. OCT enabled internal structure and tissues to be imaged to a depth of approximately 2mm and resolution of approximately 12m. Microscopy was used to observe heart rate. During our experiments, we imaged a range of internal structures in live animals including the heart and gastric areas. The trap design enables a new generation of mixed modality imaging of these animals in vivo. These techniques will enable detailed studies of the internal physiology of live krill to be undertaken under a wide range of environmental conditions and have the potential to highlight important variations in behaviour and animal development.

BRITISH JOURNAL OF NUTRITION												There is an urgent need to find alternative feed resources that can further substitute fishmeal in Atlantic salmon diets without compromising health and food quality, in particular during the finishing feeding period when the feed demand is highest and flesh quality effects are most significant. This study investigates efficacy of substituting a isoprotein (35 %) and isolipid (35 %) low fishmeal diet (FM, 15 %) with Antarctic krill meal (KM, 12 %) during 3 months with growing finishing 2 center dot 3 kg salmon (quadruplicate sea cages/diet). Final body weight (3 center dot 9 (se0 center dot 04) kg) was similar in the dietary groups, but the KM group had more voluminous body shape, leaner hearts and improved fillet integrity, firmness and colour. Ectopic epithelial cells and focal Ca deposits in intestine were only detected in the FM group. Transcriptome profiling by microarray of livers showed dietary effects on several immune genes, and a panel of structural genes were up-regulated in the KM group, including cadherin and connexin. Up-regulation of genes encoding myosin heavy chain proteins was the main finding in skeletal muscle. Morphology examination by scanning electron microscopy and secondary structure by Fourier transform IR spectroscopy revealed more ordered and stable collagen architecture of the KM group. NEFA composition of skeletal muscle indicated altered metabolism ofn-3,n-6 and SFA of the KM group. The results demonstrated that improved health and meat quality in Atlantic salmon fed krill meal were associated with up-regulation of immune genes, proteins defining muscle properties and genes involved in cell contacts and adhesion, altered fatty acid metabolism and fat deposition, and improved gut health and collagen structure.

DNA as a dietary biomarker in antarctic krill, Euphausia superba	MARINE BIOTECHNOLOGY												The diet of Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) has been studied using a variety of techniques, but current methods still suffer from problems that are difficult to solve. This study examined an alternative approach utilizing DNA as a prey biomarker. Methods were developed for the preservation, extraction, and identification of prey DNA from krill collected in the field. Group-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to amplify diatom prey (Phylum: Bacillariophyta) and the results from DNA clone libraries were compared with microscopic diet analysis. DNA analysis was superior to microscopy for prey detection. However, differences in prey relative abundance estimates between the two techniques suggested some bias in the DNA-based estimates. Quantification showed that large amounts of prey DNA had been successfully preserved and extracted. Overall the results suggest that the application of DNA-based diet analysis to krill warrants further investigation, particularly for prey that are difficult to study using other methods.

J	Reid, K; Brierley, AS				Reid, K; Brierley, AS			The use of predator-derived krill length-frequency distributions to calculate krill target strength	CCAMLR SCIENCE												The relationship between krill abundance and predator performance is fundamental to an ecosystem-based approach to resource management. We propose a method using krill sampled from the diet of predators to provide a length-frequency distribution of krill at times when it is possible to run automated shipboard acoustic systems but not to conduct scientific netting, i.e during logistic/resupply operations, This will allow a robust estimate of krill abundance to be calculated from acoustic data. Changes in the length-frequency distribution of krill over a period of a few weeks produced a 10% difference in TS, whereas simultaneous samples from predators and nets produced only a 1% difference, illustrating the need for simultaneous length-frequency data. By integrating data from land-based predators directly with automated on-board data collection systems it will be possible to gain important estimates of krill biomass at times of the season hitherto unavailable from shipboard scientific surveys.

J	Mangel, M; Switzer, PV				Mangel, M; Switzer, PV			A model at the level of the foraging trip for the indirect effects of krill (Euphausia superba) fisheries on krill predators	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING												We present a model at the level of the foraging trip for the effects of a fishery on krill (Euphausia superba) predators, using the Adelie penguin (Pygoscelis adeliae) as a model organism. The model involves: (i) the description of the biomass and spatial distribution of krill; (ii) the effects of the fishery on the krill; (iii) the description of penguin breeding; and (iv) the indirect effects of the fishery on penguin reproduction and survival. The objective is to make relative comparisons of penguin reproductive success and adult survival in the absence or presence of a fishery. The biomass of krill appropriate for the predators (and the fishery) fluctuates from one year to the next according to an age-structured, stochastic recruitment model. Furthermore, there is a spatial-temporal structure, determined by diffusion and advection, to krill availability in relation to the location of the penguin breeding colony. Fishing is assumed to change the spatial and temporal distribution of available krill. After fledging, offspring survival depends in part upon the amount of krill delivered to them during the feeding periods. We use empirical data to estimate parental and offspring needs and a standard life history model to set the upper limits for survival. Parental survival after breeding depends upon the krill deficiency (relative to needs) that parents accumulate while feeding their young. A sensitivity analysis of the breeding model shows that the predictions are robust for parameters about which little is known, to the functional forms relating krill abundance to offspring and parent survival, and to the rules that parents use to allocate krill to their offspring. We evaluate expected reproductive success (offspring survival) and expected parental survival as functions of the amount of krill captured by the fishing fleet. Over the range of catch in our study, the reductions in reproductive success are essentially linear functions of krill catch with slope 1.5 and reductions in adult survival are also linear functions of krill catch, with but slopes less than 1. That is, reductions in reproductive success and parental survival are linear functions of krill catch, but not 1:1. The reductions in offspring and parent survival are mainly determined by how long the fishing season lasts and the capacity for harvest, rather than when fishing begins.

J	Atkinson, A; Whitehouse, MJ				Atkinson, A; Whitehouse, MJ			Ammonium excretion by Antarctic krill Euphausia superba at South Georgia	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Excretion by Antarctic krill Euphausia superba (hereafter "krill") is measured typically in small containers of filtered seawater for 12-24 h, which may cause a reduction of swimming, feeding, and metabolism. if the maximum published excretion rates are realistic, krill would be a major source of regenerated nitrogen in the South Georgia area because of their high biomass there. Because literature values are variable, depending on season, feeding history and the experimental set-up, our aim was to measure both a mean and an upper value of krill excretion rate at South Georgia. Experiments were on juvenile krill during October-November 1997 and January 1998. Freshly caught animals excreted 1.6-2.8 nmol ammonium mg(-1) dry mass h(-1); within the fivefold range of summer literature values for equivalent-sized krill. Maximum rates were determined on acclimated krill in large containers during alternating 1-d periods with and without food. During the feeding periods in saturating food concentrations, the mean daily ration was similar to 32% of body carbon d(-1) and excretion was 210% (October-November) and 280% (January) of the values for freshly caught krill. This equates to a maximum loss of similar to 2% of body nitrogen d(-1). Excretion rates decreased during the 1-d periods without food, and rates during the feeding periods were similar to 30% higher than in those without food. This suggests that the lack of feeding in traditional experiments leads to roughly 30% underestimates of excretion rate. These results help to set some limits on ammonium production rates of South Georgia krill over regional scales. Our calculations suggest that the role of krill, in this varies between habitats to the west of the island (insignificant) and those in the east (significant).																	0024-3590					JAN	2000	45	1					55	63		10.4319/lo.2000.45.1.0055							WOS:000084949600006

However, its application as a novel food ingredient has not yet been fully explored. This review summarizes the chemical composition, extraction technologies, potential health benefits, and current applications of krill oil, with the aim of providing suggestions for its exploitation. Krill oil is a unique lipid consisting of diverse lipid classes and is characterized by a high concentration (39.29% to 80.69%) of phospholipids (PLs) associated with eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). It also contains considerable amounts of bioactive minor components such as astaxanthin, sterols, tocopherols, vitamin A, flavonoids, and minerals. The current technologies used in krill oil production are solvent extraction, nonsolvent extraction, super/subcritical fluid extraction, and enzyme-assisted pretreatment extraction, which all greatly influence the yield and quality of the end-product. In addition, krill oil has been documented to have various health benefits, including anti-inflammatory effects, cardiovascular disease (CVD) prevention, women's health, neuroprotection, and anticancer activities. Although krill oil products used for dietary supplements have been commercially available, few studies have attempted to explore the underlying molecular mechanisms to elucidate how exactly the krill oil exerts different biological activities. Further studies should focus on this to improve the development of krill oil products for human consumption.

J	Tarling, GA				Tarling, Geraint A.			Routine metabolism of Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) in South Georgia waters: absence of metabolic compensation at its range edge	MARINE BIOLOGY												Routine respiration rates in the South Georgia stock of Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) were measured to compare with previously published measurements on stocks from colder locations further south. Within the natural temperature range of this species (-1.8 degrees to 5.5 degrees C), respiration rate data from both the present and previous studies were adequately fitted by a single Arrhenius regression (Q(10) of 2.8), although South Georgia krill showed an upward deviation from this regression between 0 degrees and 2 degrees C (the lower temperature range at South Georgia). Metabolic compensation (i.e. the comparative lowering of respiration rate) at the high temperatures experienced at South Georgia was not apparent, although the higher than predicted metabolic rates at low temperatures suggests acclimation of South Georgia krill to a warm water lifestyle. Weight-specific respiration rate was significantly higher in sub-adults and adults compared to juveniles, highlighting the metabolic burden of reproduction. South Georgia krill showed no further increase in respiration rate when exposed to acute temperatures (5.5-12.2 degrees C), indicating that they were already at the limit of aerobic capacity by 5.5 degrees C. Overall, this study shows that even small degrees of additional warming to South Georgia waters are likely to make conditions there metabolically unsustainable for Antarctic krill.

J	Frazer, TK; Quetin, LB; Ross, RA				Frazer, TK; Quetin, LB; Ross, RA			Energetic demands of larval krill, Euphausia superba, in winter	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY												Metabolic rates of larval and juvenile krill, Euphausia superba, were measured on board ship during three winter cruises west of the Antarctic Peninsula (June-July 1987, June 1993, and June 1994), and also under different temperature regimes and feeding conditions during long-term maintenance in the laboratory (Palmer Station, winter 1993). A mean oxygen consumption and nitrogen excretion ratio of 31.1 measured on board ship at ambient ocean temperatures suggested that larval and juvenile krill from ice-covered waters were primarily herbivorous. Results from both shipboard and laboratory experiments demonstrated that oxygen consumption increased with temperature, but that larvae subjected to acute temperature increases exhibited higher rates. Experiments conducted at near ambient water temperatures for winter were also conducted to test the effect of habitat on the energy requirements of larval and juvenile krill. A comparison of the field and laboratory studies conducted at -1.5 to -1.8 degreesC showed that larvae from ice-covered waters and fed larvae in the laboratory had oxygen consumption rates significantly higher than those of larvae collected from open, i.e. ice-free, water and those starved in the laboratory. Results of the comparison lend support to the concept that in winter, larval and juvenile krill are better fed in ice-covered waters than in open water, and to the hypothesis that ice biota in the pack ice are an important food resource in winter for larval and juvenile krill.

J	Tarling, GA; Thorpe, SE				Tarling, Geraint A.; Thorpe, Sally E.			Instantaneous movement of krill swarms in the Antarctic Circumpolar Current	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Antarctic krill are known to have strong swimming capabilities, but direct observations of the speed and direction of krill-swarm movement within their natural environment are rare. We identified and examined 4060 swarms within the main flow of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (Scotia Sea) using a combination of an EK60 echosounder, a 153.6 kHz acoustic Doppler current profiler, and ground-truthing nets. Net displacement magnitude (m) and net angle of deviation (d) were determined by vector subtraction from the background flow immediately below them. Values were compared against control data sets in which swarms were absent. With greater background flow, m became increasingly lower than predicted, which suggests that drag influences swarm movement. The characteristics of the flow regime influenced swarm behavior, given that both m and d varied according to the direction of background flow. Furthermore, multiple-regression analysis indicated that swarm area, the vicinity of the sea-ice edge, and salinity had a significant influence on m, with levels of displacement being greatest in larger swarms and in low-salinity regions close to the ice edge. The ice edge is a key environment for Antarctic krill and swarm behavior may assist in retaining this location. Only fluorescence was found to have a significant influence on d, with deviations being greatest in regions of highest fluorescence. This agrees with laboratory observations of krill turning more frequently within food patches. We demonstrate that it is possible to measure instantaneous movement patterns in Antarctic krill swarms and, at large scales, these movements are consistent with current understanding of responses of krill to local stimuli such as sea-ice and patches of food.

Modeling the spatial and temporal dynamics of foraging movements of humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) in the Western Antarctic Peninsula	MOVEMENT ECOLOGY												Background: A population of humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) spends the austral summer feeding on Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) along the Western Antarctic Peninsula (WAP). These whales acquire their annual energetic needs during an episodic feeding season in high latitude waters that must sustain long-distance migration and fasting on low-latitude breeding grounds. Antarctic krill are broadly distributed along the continental shelf and nearshore waters during the spring and early summer, and move closer to land during late summer and fall, where they overwinter under the protective and nutritional cover of sea ice. We apply a novel space-time utilization distribution method to test the hypothesis that humpback whale distribution reflects that of krill: spread broadly during summer with increasing proximity to shore and associated embayments during fall. Results: Humpback whales instrumented with satellite-linked positional telemetry tags (n = 5), show decreased home range size, amount of area used, and increased proximity to shore over the foraging season. Conclusions: This study applies a new method to model the movements of humpback whales in the WAP region throughout the feeding season, and presents a baseline for future observations of the seasonal changes in the movement patterns and foraging behavior of humpback whales (one of several krill-predators affected by climate-driven changes) in the WAP marine ecosystem. As the WAP continues to warm, it is prudent to understand the ecological relationships between sea-ice dependent krill and krill predators, as well as the interactions among recovering populations of krill predators that may be forced into competition for a shared food resource.																	2051-3933						2015	3								13	10.1186/s40462-015-0041-x							WOS:000215741800013	26034604					
J	QUETIN, LB; ROSS, RM				QUETIN, LB; ROSS, RM			BEHAVIORAL AND PHYSIOLOGICAL-CHARACTERISTICS OF THE ANTARCTIC KRILL, EUPHAUSIA-SUPERBA	AMERICAN ZOOLOGIST												The antarctic krill, Euphausia superba, is considered a success in the intensely seasonal environment of the Southern Ocean because of its abundance and central role as an important food item for many of the larger carnivores in the ecosystem. The behavioral and physiological characteristics that foster this success are: (1) the ability to find concentrations of food in several types of habitat and efficiently exploit whatever food is available; (2) the close correspondence of the life cycle with seasonal cycles of food availability; and (3) a combination of physiological mechanisms that enable krill to survive the long winter period of low food availability. We evaluated the relative importance of the following four major winter-over mechanisms that have been proposed for adult krill west of the Antarctic Peninsula. The three-fold reduction in metabolic rate is the most important winter-over mechanism for these adults, although lipid utilization and shrinkage also help satisfy energy requirements in the winter. Alternate food sources did not appear to contribute significantly as a winter energy source. However, the extent, predictability and complexity of the ice cover in a region during winter may have a great influence on the relative importance of these winter-over mechanisms for different populations. Ice cover in the waters west of the Antarctic Peninsula is unpredictable and smooth surfaced when it occurs, providing the krill with little refuge from predation. In multi-year pack ice of the Weddell Sea, however, ice cover is predictable and extensive, and there is a complex undersurface that provides hiding places. In this multi-year ice, adult krill have been observed under the ice feeding, whereas west of the Antarctic Peninsula most adult krill are in the water column in the winter and are not feeding. The balance between acquiring energy and avoiding predation may be different in these two regions in the winter because of differences in predictability and complexity of the ice cover.																	0003-1569						1991	31	1					49	63									WOS:A1991FD12300005

In this paper we present the results of the influence of ultrasonication on the enzymatic treatment and the successive isolation of selenomethionine. We showed that ultrasound-assisted enzymatic digestion leads to quantitative release of selenium in the soluble fraction and recovery of selenomethionine from the krill protein within a time 2 orders of magnitude shorter. The solubilised sample was analysed by size-exclusion chromatography and the selenomethionine content was quantified by high-performance liquid chromatography-inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. In total, 99% of the selenomethionine in the krill hydrolysate was recovered from the chromatographic fractions. It corresponds to 35% of the total selenium content in Antarctic krill. Monitoring by microscopy of the changes in the structure of the krill samples during ultrasonication suggested that the enhancement of the ultrasound-assisted enzymatic reaction was mainly due to decrease of mass transfer limitations. A reference experiment for ultrasound-assisted enzymatic digestion of cell-free protein in a homogeneous system does not exclude direct influence of the ultrasound energy on the enzyme-substrate interaction.

Krill were exposed to light-cycle regimes of variable intensity to simulate Southern Ocean summer, autumn, and winter conditions, respectively, using: (1) continuous light (LL; 200 lux max), (2) 12-h light and 12-h darkness (LD 12 : 12; 50 lux max), and (3) continuous darkness (DD). In all experimental groups, the food concentration was kept at high levels (similar to 800 mu g C L-1). Krill exposed to LL and LD 12 : 12 showed an increase in all measured parameters over the experimental period. Physiological parameters of krill held under LD 12 : 12 showed a more consistent increase and remained below those of krill held under LL. No change was recorded for krill exposed to DD; clearance rates and daily C rations did not respond to the high food availability, and oxygen consumption rates and MDH activity were significantly lower (p < 0.05) than those of krill exposed to summer light condition. Thus, changes in the environmental light regime have an important effect on physiological parameters of krill, such as feeding and metabolic rates, and may indicate an inherent overwinter adaptation strategy triggered by the Antarctic light regime.

The weight of food and the species composition of the stomach contents were measured. Antarctic krill, Euphausia superba, the sole prey item taken, were compared to krill obtained by nets in the same region as part of a large-scale krill survey. Krill from petrel stomach samples were larger in mean size than those sampled by nets. This may be attributed to selection of the larger sized krill by the petrels, it may be caused by the nets sampling different populations of krill or it may be due to net avoidance by the larger krill.																	0722-4060					AUG	1993	13	6					399	403		10.1007/BF01681981							WOS:A1993LR72400005

The enzyme was used as a model to compare temperature-dependent enzymatic parameters of Antarctic krill, Euphausia superba, with those of a euphausiid species (Meganyctiphanes norvegica) found in both the Scandinavian Kattegat and the Mediterranean. Other species examined were an Antarctic isopod, Serolis polita, and a tropical crab, Ocypode ryderi. Enzyme isoforms of NAGase were isolated chromatographically. Temperature optimum (between 30 and 53-degrees-C) and activation-energy (47-59 kJ.mol-1) of isoenzymes were generally unrelated to genotypic cold adaptation. Although pH profiles were temperature-dependent, there was no apparent temperature-related control of activities by pH in the experienced physiological range. In contrast, apparent Michaelis constants showed minima at ambient water temperatures (total range: 0.1-0.6 mol . l-1). Potentially, enzyme variants play a role in acclimatisation regulated by Michaelis constants. Apparently, the rate-limiting effects of polar temperatures are partly compensated in the Antarctic crustaceans by construction of enzymes with substrate affinities similar to those of species from warmer climates. The significance of apparent Michaelis constants in evaluating mechanisms of metabolic cold compensation is discussed. Necessary additional experimental approaches are highlighted.																	0174-1578	1432-136X				FEB	1993	163	1					28	37		10.1007/BF00309662							WOS:A1993KP18600005

Acoustic determination of the distribution of fish and krill across the Scotia Sea in spring 2006, summer 2008 and autumn 2009	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY												Multifrequency acoustic backscatter data were examined from transects at eight stations across the Scotia Sea, from the South Orkneys to the north west of South Georgia. These transects were repeated in austral spring (November 2006), summer (December 2007/January 2008) and autumn (March 2009). A dB identification window (Sv120-38) identified two types of scatterers dominating the acoustic backscatter; a positive Sv120-38 indicative of Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) and a negative Sv120-38 indicative of mesopelagic fish with swim bladders, such as myctophids. Acoustic backscatter attributed to schooling myctophid fish was greater at stations in the north of the Scotia Sea across all seasons and found to increase significantly with increasing mean sea temperature and absolute dynamic height. A schools analysis identified more fish schools at the stations with high fish acoustic backscatter. The number of fish schools increased, were distributed further south, and occurred deeper from spring through to autumn. Krill density, calculated using a target strength model, was similar in spring (27.7 g m(-2)) and summer (27.2 g m(-2)), but lower (2.2 g m(-2)) in autumn 2009. An analysis of swarm characteristics showed that during the spring cruise the high mean krill density resulted from a small number of swarms containing a large number of small krill, particularly in the south of the survey region. In contrast in the summer cruise the high mean krill density resulted from a large number of swarms containing a low number of large krill. Finally, in autumn the low krill density resulted from a small number of swarms containing a small number of large krill. Krill swarms were located at a mean depth of 58 m in spring, 94 m in summer and 123 m in autumn and were generally further apart, deeper, contained fewer krill and smaller in the north of the survey region. Large-scale shifts in the latitudinal and vertical distribution of krill and schooling mesopelagic fish in the Scotia Sea were observed. This seasonal reorganisation in both horizontal and vertical distribution will alter the role of these prey items in the ecosystem. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Reid, K; Watkins, JL; Murphy, EJ; Trathan, PN; Fielding, S; Enderlein, P				Reid, Keith; Watkins, Jon L.; Murphy, Eugene J.; Trathan, Phil N.; Fielding, Sophie; Enderlein, Peter			Krill population dynamics at South Georgia: implications for ecosystem-based fisheries management	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												The South Georgia region supports a large biomass of krill that is subject to high inter-annual variability. The apparent lack of a locally self-maintaining krill population at South Georgia means that understanding the mechanism underlying these observed population characteristics is essential to successful ecosystem-based management of krill fishery in the region. Krill acoustic-density data from surveys conducted in the early, middle and late period of the summers of 2001 to 2005, together with krill population size structure over the same period from predator diet data, were used with a krill population dynamics model to evaluate potential mechanisms behind the observed changes in krill biomass. Krill abundance was highest during the middle of the summer in 3 years and in the late period in 2 years; in the latter there was evidence that krill recruitment was delayed by several months. A model scenario that included empirically derived estimates of both the magnitude and timing of recruitment in each year showed the greatest correlation with the acoustic series. The results are consistent with a krill population with allochthonous recruitment entering a retained adult population; i.e. oceanic transport of adult krill does not appear to be the major factor determining the dynamics of the adult population. The results highlight the importance of the timing of recruitment, especially where this could introduce a mismatch between the peak of krill abundance and the peak demand from predators, which may exacerbate the effects of changes in krill populations arising from commercial harvesting and/or climate change.

However, the nature and consequences of changes in krill population dynamics that accompany fluctuations in its abundance are essentially unknown. A conceptual model, developed from quantitative measures of krill length in the diet of predators at South Georgia from 1991 to 1997, allowed predictions to be made about the abundance and population structure of krill in 1998 and the consequences for predators. Consistent with model predictions, in 1998 there was a serial change in krill population structure, low krill biomass and low reproductive performance of predators. The change in the modal size of krill, from 56 mm in December to 42 mm in March, was apparently a result of the transport of krill into the region. This is the first occasion when the future status and structure of the krill population at South Georgia has been successfully predicted. By representing local krill population dynamics, which may also reflect large-scale physical and biological processes, predators have a potential key role as indicators of environmental variation in the Southern Ocean at a range of spatial scales.																	0025-3162					DEC	1999	135	4					647	652		10.1007/s002270050665							WOS:000084638000008

Distribution of larval krill and zooplankton in association with hydrography in Marguerite Bay, Antarctic Peninsula, in austral fall and winter 2001 described using the Video Plankton Recorder	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY												The Western Antarctic Peninsula is a critical locus of Antarctic krill Euphausia superba abundance and thought to be a site of successful overwintering, particularly for the larval stages. A primary goal of the Southern Ocean GLOBEC program was to describe factors that contribute to the overwintering success of krill in this region. As part of this effort we conducted Video Plankton Recorder (VPR) surveys during austral fall and winter, 2001. The VPR survey yielded high-resolution distributions of larval krill, other plankton, and marine snow in relation to hydrography from a series of transect lines orthogonal to the coast on the continental shelf of the Western Antarctic Peninsula. Four taxa (larval krill, copepods, polychaetes, pteropods) and marine snow were numerous during fall; much lower abundances of all categories were present during winter, with only larval krill, copepods, and polychaetes present in any abundance. Distributions of plankton and marine snow were associated with water-mass types and the vertical structure of the environment, particularly for larval krill that were primarily associated with the pycnocline. During fall, larval krill were present across the entire shelf, with high abundances at the shelf break. Copepods were most numerous at depth during fall, consistent with ontogenetic migration to depth at the onset of winter. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

These differences are addressed through improved understanding of key model parameters. The scattering process was modeled using the distorted-wave Born approximation, representing the shape of the animal as a bent and tapered cylinder. Recently published length-based regressions were used to constrain the sound speed and density contrasts between the animal and the surrounding seawater, rather than the earlier approach of using single values for all lengths. To constrain the parameter governing the orientation of the animal relative to the incident acoustic wave, direct measurements of the orientation of krill in situ were made with a video plankton recorder. In contrast to previous indirect and aquarium-based observations, krill were observed to orient themselves mostly horizontally. Averaging predicted scattering over the measured distribution of orientations resulted in predictions of target strength consistent with in situ measurements of target strength of large krill (mean length 40-43 mm) at four frequencies (43-420 kHz), but smaller than expected under the semi-empirical model traditionally used to estimate krill target strength.

A POTENTIAL FEEDBACK APPROACH TO ECOSYSTEM-BASED MANAGEMENT: MODEL PREDICTIVE CONTROL OF THE ANTARCTIC KRILL FISHERY	CCAMLR SCIENCE												CCAMLR aims to develop a feedback approach to aid ecosystem-based management (EBM) of Antarctic krill fisheries. It is important to assess whether a feedback approach is likely to achieve the multiple objectives that EBM implies in the complex and uncertain conditions typical of Antarctic marine ecosystems. This study used Model Predictive Control (MPC) to achieve objectives for a harvested species, its predators and the fishery, in a simulation model that incorporates uncertainty and spatial and trophic complexity. The approach adjusted spatially resolved annual catch limits in response to estimates of the state of the system. It suggests that feedback management is both feasible and a more effective way to achieve multiple objectives than fixed catch limits, which are currently used to manage Antarctic krill fisheries. The study demonstrates that optimisation-based approaches such as MPC are computationally capable of dealing with EBM-type problems. They are also useful for assessing the feasibility of candidate management policies or objectives, and characterising the trade-offs that they imply. This study characterises the trade-off between catch levels and the risk of harvested species biomass falling to unacceptable levels.

There were correlations between percentage IMP-1 and the concentration (gram: gram dry weight) of the diatom biomarker fatty acids, 16: 4(n-1) and 20: 5(n-3) in tissues of individual krill, suggesting that the abundance of diatoms in the environment of the krill in the intermoult period prior to moulting was a key determinant of change in body length, a proxy for growth. This substantiates the view that diatoms are crucial for supporting high growth rates of krill, either as a direct food source or, indirectly, by enhancing production of microzooplankton and mesozooplankton based food webs.																	0024-3590					MAR	2005	50	2					732	736		10.4319/lo.2005.50.2.0732							WOS:000227835200034						
J	Leane, E; Nicol, S				Leane, Elizabeth; Nicol, Steve			Charismatic Krill? Size and Conservation in the Ocean	ANTHROZOOS												The open ocean is an alien place for human beings and for most of history it has been studied using very indirect means. A great deal of what we know about animals that live on land, from ants to elephants, is based on centuries of direct natural history observations of animals alive and in situ. There is no such body of observation of marine animals. Most of what we know about animals in the ocean comes from studying dead animals, collected in nets towed through ocean depths that we can rarely observe. Marine biological knowledge is flavored by the material we have to work with and this, in turn, is affected by the terminology that early scientists used in an attempt to describe the strange world that their nets revealed. Despite the recent development of more sophisticated ways of investigating the ocean, many marine scientists continue to adopt nineteenth-century terminology and approaches (such as the use of the term zooplankton and the use of plankton nets), and this colors interpretation of the results of oceanographic studies. Using Antarctic krill Euphausia superba as an example, we suggest that the perception amongst both scientists and the general public of krill's small size, passivity, and lack of individuality has led to their being treated less like animals themselves than as background habitat for other animals. Because krill have such a central role in the Antarctic ecosystem and are the subject of a large fishery, these assumptions may have serious consequences for krill themselves and the conservation of the Antarctic region as a whole.

Extraction and characterisation of lipids from Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba)	FOOD CHEMISTRY												There is significant commercial interest in oil extraction from krill because it is rich in omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFA) such as eicosapentaenoic (EPA, 20:5n3) and docosahexaenoic (DHA, 22:6n3) acids. The objectives were to determine oil extraction efficiency using different solvent systems and the composition of extracted oil and spent krill following extraction. Extraction efficiency was the highest (P < 0.05) for one-step extraction using freeze-dried krill with 1:12 or 1:30 krill:solvent ratio (w:v) compared to Folch, Soxhlet, and conventional two-step extraction. Extracted oils contained predominantly phospholipids (20-33%), polar non-phospholipids (64-77%), and minor triglycerides (1-3%). Triglycerides contained much less (P < 0.05) total n-3 (4.0%), DHA (1.1%), and EPA (2.3%), but more < 0.05) saturated FA (38.7%) than phospholipids (total n-3-47.4%, DHA-18.0%, EPA-28.2%, saturated FA-23.5%). Antioxidant capacity of krill oil extracted by one-step extraction (9.4-14.2 mu mol Trolox Equivalents/ml oil) was generally similar to antioxidant capacity of krill oil extracted by ethanol (22.9), but greater (P < 0.05) than antioxidant capacity of krill oil extracted by acetone (1.2) and Folch method (1.5). The spent krill following oil extraction contained protein (72.9-75.8%, dry basis). Based on the extraction efficiency and composition of the extracted oil, the one-step extraction using 1:12 krill:solvent ratio is recommended. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

It has been ascertained that krill migrations occur between sea surface and a depth of about 100 m. Availability of food is the key factor affecting both seasonal and annual changes, and leads to krill migration. Under good feeding conditions the amplitude is maximal, and the migration cycle approaches 24 h. Adult individuals exhibit 24 h migration, whereas juveniles show lower migration, and their submergence is shallower. Water stratification may also affect krill distribution in the water column, and in certain conditions may lead to limitation of migration range.																	0011-3891					NOV 25	2005	89	10					1749	1753									WOS:000233736400025						
J	ENDO, Y				ENDO, Y			ORIENTATION OF ANTARCTIC KRILL IN AN AQUARIUM	NIPPON SUISAN GAKKAISHI												Acoustic methods appear to be the best way to estimate Antarctic krill abundance directly. Information on body orientation, however, is needed to obtain reliable krill acoustic target strength (TS) values, since TS varies with body orientation. Krill body orientation was measured in an aquarium aboard the R. V. Kaiyo Maru. Average body orientation was 45.6-degrees (SD = 19.6-degrees, N = 67), which was slightly less than that when animals were hovering, 49.7-degrees (SD = 7.5-degrees, N = 50). Such an acute angle of elevation would tend to reduce the reflected echo intensity when compared to animals swimming horizontally. Although mature females with marked swelling of the cephalothorax were not included in the experiment, the center of mass was found to be situated more to the anterior than in males and immature females. The hovering orientation, which is close to average body orientation, of mature males and mature females was estimated on the basis of Kils' model. Mature females with swollen cephalothorax demonstrated larger tilt angles relative to the horizontal plane than did males, as the center of mass is positioned more to the anterior and the pleopods are less developed in It is concluded that the orientation, and therefore TS, may differ according to the maturity stage composition of individual aggregations.																	0021-5392					MAR	1993	59	3					465	468									WOS:A1993KX82400009

Ages two through five years were validated, and these animals ranged from 37.1 to 62.6 mm in total length. The band counts in these individuals were either identical to their absolute ages, or only failed to agree by a few months, which demonstrates the accuracy of this method. Precision and bias were estimated graphically using Chang's index (Coefficient of Variation = 5.03%). High accuracy and precision between readers and low ageing bias indicate that longitudinal sections of eyestalks can be used to age krill in wild samples and to develop age-based stock assessment models for krill. Archival samples preserved in formalin (5%) and stored in ambient conditions were also readable. Ageing preserved krill will provide the opportunity to examine changes in growth among krill populations within the Southern Ocean and to retrospectively examine changes in krill production over the last century to better understand the historical and future impacts of climate change on this critical Southern Ocean species.

Although ecosystem and management models typically assume that krill are passive drifters, their relatively large size and strong swimming ability suggest that the active movement of krill may play an important role in their spatial distribution. Thus, active swimming behavior by krill may influence spatial structure of food web interactions (e.g. feeding behavior of seabirds and marine mammals) and regional commercial fishery activity. The objective of this work was to model the potential for active movement to affect krill distribution, and consequently growth, reproductive success, and survival. We used state-dependent life history theory, implemented by stochastic dynamic programming, in combination with spatial information on food availability, current velocity, temperature, and predation risk, to predict krill swimming behavior near the northern Antarctic Peninsula. We found that including active krill behavior resulted in distribution patterns that are associated with increased survival, growth, and reproductive success compared to a model that treats krill as passive drifters. The expected reproductive success of actively behaving krill was about 70% greater than that of passively diffusing krill, suggesting that there are strong selective pressures for active behavior along oceanic drift trajectories. This modeling framework will benefit assessments of new catch limits as krill fishing grounds are partitioned into smaller spatial management units.																	0171-8630	1616-1599				JUN 8	2015	529						35	48		10.3354/meps11324							WOS:000356076000003

We have assessed variability in krill recruitment and density with hypothesized environmental, factors, including strength of westerly winds (westerlies) determined from sea level pressure differences across the Drake Passage, sea ice cover, and ozone depletion. We found a significant positive correlation between krill recruitment in the Antarctic Peninsula area and the strength of westerlies during 1982-1998. Years with strong westerlies during the austral summer season resulted in high krill recruitment in 1987/1988, 1990/1991, and 1994/1995, while the years of weak westerlies resulted in low krill recruitment in 1982/1983, 1988/1989, 1992/1993, and 1996/1997. The strength of westerlies was significantly related to recruitment of 1-year-old krill (r = 0.57) and 2-year-old krill (r = 0.69) with a level of significance of 5%. In addition, the strength of westerlies also had a strong correlation with chlorophyll a (r = 0.63) and sea ice cover with a 1-year time lag (r = 0.67). The strength of westerlies is considered to be a key environmental factor. We also found significant correlations between krill density in the Antarctic Peninsula area and the Antarctic ozone depletion parameters during 1977-1997 (e.g., total ozone in October at Faraday/Vernadsky Station of I = 0.76 with a level of significance of 1%). We suspect that ozone depletion impacts directly and/or indirectly on the variability in krill density.																	2169-9275	2169-9291				SEP 15	1999	104	C9					20651	20665		10.1029/1999JC900136							WOS:000083473200011

A midwater sampler-trawl (Hamburg Plankton Net) was used to collect zooplankton and fish larvae, Mean relative biomass of Antarctic krill Euphausia superba. in the area north of Continental Shelf, was 9.3 g/1000 m(3) of filtered water with a mean density of 10.9 ind./1000 m(3). Ice krill Euphausia crystallorophias replaced the Antarctic krill in dominance in the High Antarctic Zone (south of 74degrees), with a mean relative biomass of 3.0 g/1000 m(3) and a mean density of 19.1 ind./1000 m(3). The present data have demonstrated that in the Ross Sea the two species of euphausiid inhabited different areas during the summer period. Oceanographic data indicate that both euphausiid species were found in surface waters. Euphausia crystallorophias in proper Ross Sea water. and Euphausia superba in Antarctic Surface Water. The catch data of Euphausia superba, ere characterised by the complete absence of larval stages, scarce occurrence of juveniles and composed primarily of large adult stages, Whereas the overall length frequency distribution of Euphausia crystallorophias was characterised by a first mode of juvenile individuals and a second mode consisting of sub-adults and adults.

S	Siegel, V; Watkins, JL		Siegel, V		Siegel, Volker; Watkins, Jonathan L.			Distribution, Biomass and Demography of Antarctic Krill, Euphausia superba	BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY OF ANTARCTIC KRILL	Advances in Polar Ecology											There are increasing concerns over potential long-term changes in krill distribution and abundance, determining whether such changes are related to climate change and/or harvesting and how they might be distinguished from multi-scale variability. With nearly a century of observations on krill distribution, the general patterns of occurrence were determined over 50 years ago, however the last decade has seen an important consolidation of details of seasonal and inter-annual distributions, although some potentially important krill habitats such as the Bellingshausen, Amundsen and Ross Seas are still poorly sampled. Moreover the unexplored perennial multi-year pack-ice regions still await survey by remote under-ice samplers. Krill consistently occur in the upper 200 m of the ocean but various recent observations show that a substantial proportion of the population may be found below this pelagic zone. To further understand variability and change there has been a focus on the importance of historic data with the compilation of comprehensive databases, re-analysis of large scale synoptic surveys and the generation of smaller scale time series that now span several decades. In particular the compilation of 90 years of net samples has provided a key resource both in showing changes in large-scale abundance over the last 50 years and together with acoustic data in generating modern estimates of overall krill abundance and biomass. Meanwhile, the increasing availability of ocean circulation models together with remotely sensed data, has enabled the exploration of large-scale teleconnections at both the regional (Scotia Sea) and circum-polar scale and at the seasonal to decadal time scales.																	2468-5712		978-3-319-29279-3; 978-3-319-29277-9				2016							21	100		10.1007/978-3-319-29279-3_2	10.1007/978-3-319-29279-3						WOS:000401843300003

Krill lipids are primarily derived from their diet of plankton, in particular diatoms and flagellates. Few attempts have been made to link the spatial and temporal variations in krill lipids to those in their food supply. Remotely-sensed environmental parameters provide large-scale information on the potential availability of krill food, although relating this to physiological and biochemical differences has only been performed on small scales and with limited samples. Our study utilised remotely-sensed data (chlorophyll a and sea surface temperature) coupled with krill lipid data obtained from 3 years of fishery-derived samples. We examined within and between year variation of trends in both the environment and krill biochemistry data. Chlorophyll a levels were positively related to krill lipid levels, particularly triacylglycerol. Plankton fatty acid biomarkers analysed in krill (such as n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids) increased with decreasing sea surface temperature and increasing chlorophyll a levels. Our study demonstrates the utility of combining remote-sensing and biochemical data in examining biological and physiological relationships between Antarctic krill and the Southern Ocean environment.

The Application of Optical Coherence Tomography to Image Subsurface Tissue Structure of Antarctic Krill Euphausia superba	PLOS ONE												Many small open ocean animals, such as Antarctic krill, are an important part of marine ecosystems. To discover what will happen to animals such as krill in a changing ocean, experiments are run in aquaria where conditions can be controlled to simulate water characteristics predicted to occur in the future. The response of individual animals to changing water conditions can be hard to observe, and with current observation techniques it is very difficult to follow the progress of an individual animal through its life. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is an optical imaging technique that allows images at high resolution to be obtained from depths up to a few millimeters inside biological specimens. It is compatible with in vivo imaging and can be used repeatedly on the same specimens. In this work, we show how OCT may be applied to post mortem krill samples and how important physiological data such as shell thickness and estimates of organ volume can be obtained. Using OCT we find an average value for the thickness of krill exoskeleton to be (30 +/- 4) mu m along a 1 cm length of the animal body. We also show that the technique may be used to provide detailed imagery of the internal structure of a pleopod joint and provide an estimate for the heart volume of (0.73 +/- 0.03) mm(3).

Are Antarctic minke whales unusually abundant because of 20th century whaling?	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY												Severe declines in megafauna worldwide illuminate the role of top predators in ecosystem structure. In the Antarctic, the Krill Surplus Hypothesis posits that the killing of more than 2 million large whales led to competitive release for smaller krill-eating species like the Antarctic minke whale. If true, the current size of the Antarctic minke whale population may be unusually high as an indirect result of whaling. Here, we estimate the long-term population size of the Antarctic minke whale prior to whaling by sequencing 11 nuclear genetic markers from 52 modern samples purchased in Japanese meat markets. We use coalescent simulations to explore the potential influence of population substructure and find that even though our samples are drawn from a limited geographic area, our estimate reflects ocean-wide genetic diversity. Using Bayesian estimates of the mutation rate and coalescent-based analyses of genetic diversity across loci, we calculate the long-term population size of the Antarctic minke whale to be 670 000 individuals (95% confidence interval: 374 000-1 150 000). Our estimate of long-term abundance is similar to, or greater than, contemporary abundance estimates, suggesting that managing Antarctic ecosystems under the assumption that Antarctic minke whales are unusually abundant is not warranted.

Using carapace measurements to determine the sex of Antarctic krill, Euphausia superba	POLAR BIOLOGY												Krill (Euphausia superba) carapace measurements (length and width; mm) collected from plankton tows in the South Shetland Islands (SSI), Antarctica are used to test the generality of a common discriminant function developed to reconstruct krill length frequencies in Antarctic fur seal diets for the area surrounding South Georgia (SG). Total length and sex ratio of krill in the SSI were overestimated by 5.6 and 154%, respectively, when the SG allometric equations were applied to 3 years (2003-2005) of data. These errors arise and increase as a result of krill population dynamics, specifically recruitment that contributes large proportions of immature krill, misclassified as males by the SG discriminant function. We develop sex-specific regression models based on separate discriminant functions that provide significantly better discriminatory power. However, our analysis indicates that reconstructions of krill sex ratio and length composition in the ocean environment are less reliable in years when the ratio of immature to mature krill is high. For the SSI area, five out of 14 years (35.7%) surveyed (1992-2005) had proportions of immature to mature adult krill >= 0.50.																	0722-4060					FEB	2007	30	3					307	315		10.1007/s00300-006-0184-8							WOS:000244212700006

The results showed that raising the AKO level resulted in concave-up changes in the mean size of oil droplets which became more densely packed. Confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) and cryo-scanning electron microscopy (cryo-SEM) micrographs revealed that PLs at higher concentrations expelled more casein particles from the oil droplet surface, which facilitated the formation of a crosslinked network structure of HIPEs, leading to reduced mobility of water molecules, extended physical stability, and somewhat solid-like behavior. The rheological analysis showed at lower levels of AKO promoted fluidity of emulsions, while at higher levels it increased elasticity. Lastly, increasing the AKO level slowed down the oxidation of HIPEs. These findings provide useful insights for developing HIPEs of highly viscous AKO and its application in foods.

Krill growth and condition in Western Indian Ocean sector of the Southern Ocean 30-80 degrees E in austral summer 2006	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY												Krill growth and physiological condition were measured during the Baseline Research on Oceanography, Krill and the Environment - West (BROKE-West) large-scale survey of the Western Indian Ocean sector (30-80 degrees E) of the Southern Ocean. Krill growth and condition were related to sea-surface temperature (SST) and Chlorophyll a levels. Estimates of Antarctic krill growth were obtained using the Instantaneous Growth Rate (IGR) technique, which reflects in situ growth of krill during the intermoult period prior to capture. A total of 10,362 krill were incubated in the IGR experiments conducted on board the research vessel. The average growth rate ranged between 1.8-9.6% of body length throughout the study area (n=1557). Juvenile and sub-adult krill showed higher growth rates compared to adults. Growth decreased with size for krill of all maturity classes, with the largest krill (total length >50 mm) expressing negative growth. On average, mean growth was higher (6.5%) in the western section (30-55 degrees E) of the study area compared to the east (56-80 degrees E) (4.2%). In the western section significantly higher growth rates were recorded for krill sampled close to the ice-edge (8.4%) compared to the open ocean (4.2%), which may be due to the presence of phytoplankton blooms associated with the retreating sea ice. However, in the eastern sector higher growth rates occurred in krill from the open ocean compared to the krill caught in areas closer to the coast (5.4% and 2.6% respectively). Krill condition was measured in terms of digestive gland size as a percentage of carapace length. The size of krill digestive gland relative to carapace length ranged from 0.46 to 0.66 (n=2403). A significant positive correlation was found between growth rate and size of the digestive gland (r(2)=0.7), indicating that growth is related to feeding events. Both digestive gland size and krill growth significantly increased with increasing Chlorophyll a levels and declining SST. Crown Copyright (C) 2009 Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Ecosystem services of the Southern Ocean: trade-offs in decision-making	ANTARCTIC SCIENCE												Ecosystem services are the benefits that mankind obtains from natural ecosystems. Here we identify the key services provided by the Southern Ocean. These include provisioning of fishery products, nutrient cycling, climate regulation and the maintenance of biodiversity, with associated cultural and aesthetic benefits. Potential catch limits for Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba Dana) alone are equivalent to 11% of current global marine fisheries landings. We also examine the extent to which decision-making within the Antarctic Treaty System (ATS) considers trade-offs between ecosystem services, using the management of the Antarctic krill fishery as a case study. Management of this fishery considers a three-way trade-off between fisheries performance, the status of the krill stock and that of predator populations. However, there is a paucity of information on how well these components represent other ecosystem services that might be degraded as a result of fishing. There is also a lack of information on how beneficiaries value these ecosystem services. A formal ecosystem assessment would help to address these knowledge gaps. It could also help to harmonize decision-making across the ATS and promote global recognition of Southern Ocean ecosystem services by providing a standard inventory of the relevant ecosystem services and their value to beneficiaries.

We used shipboard surveys over nine years to investigate environmental determinants of seabird hotspots near the Antarctic Peninsula, a region experiencing rapid climate change and an expanding krill fishery. We hypothesize that seabird hotspots are structured by mesoscale ocean conditions that reflect differences in prey distribution within oceanic and coastal waters. We used generalized additive models to quantify functional relationships of seabird hotspots with krill biomass, and a suite of remotely sensed environmental variables, such as eddy kinetic energy. The spatial organization, changes in intensity, and distribution shifts of seabird hotspots indicate different environmental drivers within coastal and oceanic domains and reflect the seasonal variability of the ecosystem. Our results indicate at least eight mesoscale hotspot zones that represent ecologically important areas where significant krill and predator biomass may be concentrated. Our ecosystem assessment of seabird hotspots identified critical foraging habitat and provided reference points to benefit research on estimating their trophic impacts on Antarctic ecosystems and potential effects from the krill fishery. Our approach is generally applicable to other pelagic ecosystems that are structured by hydrographic fronts and eddies, and containing schooling forage species shared by multiple wide-ranging predators. Furthermore, identification of biological hotspots is useful for the designation of marine protected areas most critical to potentially endangered wildlife and fisheries resources.																	1432-9840	1435-0629				AUG	2017	20	5					885	903		10.1007/s10021-016-0078-8							WOS:000407846100003

Its characteristics were examined by biochemical and immunohistochemical techniques. The major a component of the krill collagen, referred to as a I(Kr) component, occupied more than 80% of the total pepsin-solubilized collagen and showed typical compositional feature of crustacean major collagens, with low and high contents of alanine and hydroxylysine, respectively. The alpha 1(Kr) component was mainly distributed in relatively thick connective tissues, epimysium and perimysium. These results suggest that the alpha 1(Kr) component may functionally correspond to the major ct component of collagen in decapods, alpha 1(AR-I) (AR-I: Arthropod-Type I), and comprise a major homotrimeric collagen molecule, [alpha 1(AR-I)(3)].

Decision-making for ecosystem-based management: evaluating options for a krill fishery with an ecosystem dynamics model	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS												Decision-makers charged with implementing ecosystem-based management (EBM) rely on scientists to predict the consequences of decisions relating to multiple, potentially conflicting, objectives. Such predictions are inherently uncertain, and this can be a barrier to decision-making. The Convention on the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources requires managers of Southern Ocean fisheries to sustain the productivity of target stocks, the health and resilience of the ecosystem, and the performance of the fisheries themselves. The managers of the Antarctic krill fishery in the Scotia Sea and southern Drake Passage have requested advice on candidate management measures consisting of a regional catch limit and options for subdividing this among smaller areas. We developed a spatially resolved model that simulates krill-predator-fishery interactions and reproduces a plausible representation of past dynamics. We worked with experts and stakeholders to identify (1) key uncertainties affecting our ability to predict ecosystem state; (2) illustrative reference points that represent the management objectives; and (3) a clear and simple way of conveying our results to decision-makers. We developed four scenarios that bracket the key uncertainties and evaluated candidate management measures in each of these scenarios using multiple stochastic simulations. The model emphasizes uncertainty and simulates multiple ecosystem components relating to diverse objectives. We summarize the potentially complex results as estimates of the risk that each illustrative objective will not be achieved (i.e., of the state being outside the range specified by the reference point). This approach allows direct comparisons between objectives. It also demonstrates that a candid appraisal of uncertainty, in the form of risk estimates, can be an aid, rather than a barrier, to understanding and using ecosystem model predictions. Management measures that reduce coastal fishing, relative to oceanic fishing, apparently reduce risks to both the fishery and the ecosystem. However, alternative reference points could alter the perceived risks, so further stakeholder involvement is needed to identify risk metrics that appropriately represent their objectives.				, Jefferson/AAG-1702-2021; Simeon, Hill L/B-2307-2008	, Jefferson/0000-0002-3600-1414; 												1051-0761	1939-5582				JUN	2013	23	4					710	725		10.1890/12-1371.1							WOS:000320105100003	23865224

Lipid composition showed wax esters and triacylglycerols as main neutral lipids for T macrura and E. vallentini respectively. Allometric relationships between lipid class and total lipids indicated that changes in total lipids were size dependent and mainly related to wax esters in T macrura and polar lipids (both phosphatidylcholine or PC and phosphatidylethanolamine or PE) in E. vallentini. No difference in lipid composition could be shown for mate and female E. vallentini, while sampling location, developmental stage and sex were significantly influential in T macrura. In this latter species wax esters displayed relatively similar fatty acid and alcohol composition in both juvenile and female stages, whereas a striking difference could be seen between females and juveniles in terms of polar lipids with a very low PE content in females. Male and female E. vallentini showed little differences in fatty acid structure with the exception of PC in females, which were low in 22:6n-3. The trophic status of these two species was established using multivariate discriminant analysis, which indicated for E. vallentini a degree of omnivory similar to E. superba, while these T macrura appeared more omnivorous than individuals collected in other areas of the Southern Ocean. Clustering of polar lipid composition suggested a link between differences in PC fatty acid and the post-spawn stage of the female of E. vallentini collected. The same probably applies for the changes in PE recorded for T macrura females.																	0954-1020					DEC	2003	15	4					463	475		10.1017/S0954102003001573							WOS:000187366600008

Six diets were formulated to contain about 50% protein and 8% lipid. A control diet (R0) without AKM and the other five diets with 8.1, 16.2, 24.3, 32.4, and 42.5% AKM supplementation (R10-50) to replace 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50% fishmeal protein were used to feed to juvenile spotted halibut.

Results showed that the specific growth rate, feed intake, and protein efficiency ratio in the R30 and R40 groups were significantly higher than that in other groups (P<0.05). Survival rate in the R50 group was significantly lower compared with the R0 group and the other four AKM supplementation groups. Moreover, the rising AKM levels in diets had significant effects on the chemical composition of juvenile spotted halibut, showing significantly decreased contents of crude protein, but increased lipid and ash contents (P<0.05). The total superoxide dismutase activity and catalase activity of serum and liver in AKM groups were significantly higher than those in the control group (P<0.05). In contrast, the contents of malondialdehyde in serum and liver were significantly lower compared with the control group. These findings illustrate that a moderate AKM level in diets can significantly improve the growth performance, feed utilization, and antioxidative capacity in juvenile spotted halibut, which support the finding that AKM may be used as a good protein source for halibut in the aquafeed industry.																	0893-8849	1749-7345				AUG	2018	49	4					761	769		10.1111/jwas.12455							WOS:000440844200012

Investigations into stable isotopic values of krill in predation hotspots arc important in facilitating our understanding of the feeding environments of krill in a local coastal ecosystem. In this study we investigated stable isotopic values and maturity and size composition of krill at a small spatial scale. by logging GPS tracks of five Chinstrap Pygoscelis antarcticus and seven Gentoo P. papua penguins, and analyzing their stomach contents. The study was conducted at a penguin colony on Barton Peninsula, King George Island, Antarctica. The main food item of both species was Antarctic Krill (>98% wet mass). One Chinstrap and four Gentoo penguin foraging trips were classified as "on-shelf" trips, and four Chinstrap and three Gentoo Penguin foraging trips Were classified as off shelf trips. Krill collected from off-shelf trips had higher delta N-15 (4.22 +/- 0.28 parts per thousand) values than those from on-shelf trips (3.78 +/- 0.29 parts per thousand). The delta C-13 of the krill samples did not differ between the two penguin species or between trip types. The proportion of juvenile krill taken was higher for Chinstrap (13.04 +/- 4.97%) than Gentoo penguins (3.33 +/- 2.43%). Our results suggest that the main food source of the krill in our sample originated as non benthic planktonic/suspended organic matter; and that krill in off-shelf habitat may occasionally consume higher trophic level prey compared to those in on-shelf habitats.																	1347-0558					JAN	2015	14	1					13	20		10.2326/osj.14.13							WOS:000349459700003

Estimates of recruitment in both regions show a nonlinear relationship between recruitment and sea ice area in the combined Bellingshausen and Amundsen Seas from the previous winter and spring, with large recruitment events occurring over a narrow range of ice area, and minimal recruitment otherwise. This finding may allow for an adaptive approach in which future catch limits are adjusted based on predictions of biomass. This result also suggests that the ecosystem may change dramatically once average ice area drops below the recruitment threshold.

The replacement of fish meal with Antarctic krill, Euphausia superba in diets for Atlantic salmon, Salmo salar	AQUACULTURE NUTRITION												A total of six isoprotein and isolipid diets for Atlantic salmon, Salmo salar L., were prepared substituting from 0 to 100% of fish meal protein (0-68% of diet by dry weight) with meal from Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba). The feed produced from high inclusion levels of krill meal had lower ability to absorb lipid during vacuum coating than fish meal. Both amino acid and fatty acid compositions of the diets were fairly similar. The experiment commenced using salmon averaging 500 g and ended at a mean weight of 1500-1800 g (140 days of feeding). Moderate amounts of krill meal (20-60% of krill protein) in the diets increased growth during the first 71 days of feeding compared with the fish meal control, while no growth difference was observed during the last 69 days of feeding. This may, at least in parts, be explained by a feed-attractant function of the krill meal. Muscle dry weight and lipid concentrations were unaffected by the diet. Feed conversion rate increased with high levels of krill meal in the diets (e. g. for the last period from 0.94 in the 0% diet to 1.26 in the 100% diet). This indicates that the fish were able to compensate by eating more to maintain growth. The apparent digestibility coefficients of dry matter and protein were not influenced by diet, but both faecal moisture and lipid had a tendency to increase at the highest inclusion level (all protein from krill meal). This may be related to chitin in the krill diet that is known to decrease lipid absorption and induce diarrhoea (increased water content in faeces). Chitin was not utilized to any major extent. Welfare parameters such as blood haemoglobin, red blood cell counts, plasma protein, cholesterol, triacylglycerols and glucose levels were unaffected by diets. Clinical indicators of cellular damage (alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase) were similar indicating no diet-induced tissue damage during the trial.

S	Schmidt, K; Atkinson, A		Siegel, V		Schmidt, Katrin; Atkinson, Angus			Feeding and Food Processing in Antarctic Krill (Euphausia superba Dana)	BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY OF ANTARCTIC KRILL	Advances in Polar Ecology											Euphausia superba is exceptional among euphausiids for the large filtering surface of the feeding basket and its fine mesh size (2-3 mu m), which remain into adulthood. This enables them to feed efficiently on nano-and microplankton, and to reach substantial growth rates with food concentrations as low as 0.5 mu g Chlorophyll a L-1. Even though phytoplankton - in particular diatoms - are their staple food, protozoans and small copepods are ingested simultaneously and represent an important supplementary food source year-round. However, krill feeding behaviour is more complex than just filter-feeding in the water column, it includes raptorial capture of larger zooplankton, handling of 'giant' diatoms, scraping algae from beneath sea ice and lifting detritus from the seabed. High mobility and physiological robustness enable krill to explore three feeding grounds - the water column, the sea ice and the benthos. Variability in access and productivity of these feeding grounds leads to fundamental differences in krill overwintering across their habitats. Gut passage time, absorption efficiency and fecal pellet density vary with food concentration and nutritional needs. Therefore krill fecal pellets have a dual role; some promote the export of carbon and nutrients while others facilitate the recycling of material in the upper water column. Krill grazing can suppress phytoplankton blooms, but this tends to be a localised phenomenon where krill abundances are exceptionally high. Conversely, krill appear to have major conditioning effects due to nutrient supply (e.g. ammonium, iron), although their role in Southern Ocean biogeochemical cycles is only starting to be discovered.																	2468-5712		978-3-319-29279-3; 978-3-319-29277-9				2016							175	224		10.1007/978-3-319-29279-3_5	10.1007/978-3-319-29279-3						WOS:000401843300006

After a 9-week feeding trial, results showed that the specific growth rate and feed efficiency ratio were not negatively affected by dietary krill meal levels. Increasing levels of dietary krill meal linearly and quadratically increased significantly FI (P < .05). Significant positive linear trends were found between the increasing levels of dietary krill meal and carotenoid concentrations, redness (a*), yellowness (b*) in skin (P < .05). And the color can be distinguished by the human eye when 15% fishmeal protein was replaced by krill meal protein due to the total color difference (Delta E) was > 3. Texture and pH in muscle were not negatively affected, however, liquid holding capacity linearly decreased (P < .05). The increasing dietary krill meal resulted in a linear decrease in most of free amino acids and a linear increase in inosinic acid (P < .05). The concentrations of EPA was linearly increased with the increasing krill meal level, n-3/n-6 ratio ranged from 0.68-0.91 within the human dietary requirements. Total amino acid profile kept unchanged among all the treatments. Although the increase of dietary krill meal significantly linearly increased the content of fluorine in muscle (P < .05), the highest content was within the safe edible limit for human. The expression levels of mTOR, 4E-BP1, eIF4E, S6K1, S6 genes related to TOR signaling pathway and phosphorylation of mTOR were not significantly changed among all treatment. These results suggested that Antarctic krill meal could be a viable alternative dietary protein source for large yellow croaker. And 6.59%-32.93% of dietary krill meal can result in a better skin color and fatty acid nutritional value in muscle without negative effects on growth performance of large yellow croaker.																	0044-8486	1873-5622				OCT 15	2019	512								734281	10.1016/j.aquaculture.2019.734281							WOS:000491992200013

Although the adaptive significance of this seasonal metabolic shift seems obvious, the driving factors are still unclear. In particular, it is debated whether the seasonal metabolic cycle is driven by changes in food availability, or if an endogenous timing system entrained by photoperiod might be involved. In this study, we used different long-term photoperiodic simulations to examine the influence of light regime and endogenous rhythmicity on the regulation of krill seasonal metabolic cycle. Krill showed a seasonal cycle of growth characterized by null-to-negative growth rates during autumn-winter and positive growth rates during spring-summer, which was manifested also in constant darkness, indicating strong endogenous regulation. Similar endogenous cycles were observed for the activity of the key-metabolic enzyme malate dehydrogenase (MDH) and for the expression levels of a selection of metabolic-related genes, with higher values in spring-summer and lower values in autumn-winter. On the other side, a seasonal cycle of oxygen consumption was observed only when krill were exposed to simulated seasonal changes in photoperiod, indicating that light-related cues might play a major role in the regulation of krill oxygen consumption. The influence of light-regime on oxygen consumption was minimal during winter, when light-phase duration was below 8 h, and it was maximal during summer, when light-phase duration was above 16 h. Significant upregulation of the krill clock genes clk, cry2, and tim1, as well as of the circadian-related opsins rh1a and rrh, was observed after light-phase duration had started to decrease in early autumn, suggesting the presence of a signaling cascade linking specific seasonal changes in the Antarctic light regime with clock gene activity and the regulation of krill metabolic dormancy over the winter.

Proteins exhibit immense effect on lipid oxidation and induce protein-lipid co-oxidation. This study aimed at elucidating the co-oxidation mechanism of AKO and whey protein (WP) or myofibrillar protein (MP) in oil-in-water emulsions. The estimations of malondialdehyde (MDA) content, phospholipid molecular species, and pyrrole content resulted in increased and decreased oxidation rate of AKO (especially phosphatidylethanolamine) by WP and MP, respectively. Meanwhile, protein concentration, sulfhydryl content, the loss of tryptophan fluorescence intensity, and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis results demonstrated that AKO promoted WP oxidation but inhibited MP oxidation. Further, the antioxidative abilities of seven common antioxidants were evaluated. Ascorbyl palmitate showed the most substantial antioxidative effect for both AKO and proteins (about 70% decrease of MDA content and 30% decrease of the decrease ratio of tryptophan fluorescence intensity). This finding supported that different proteins could exhibit different pro/anti-oxidative effects on lipid oxidation, especially for marine lipids abundant in phospholipids and polyunsaturated fatty acids. Besides, MP could also act as antioxidant in MP AKO emulsions, further extending its application from traditional surfactants. Practical Application AKO is usually encapsulated by the protein materials, enhancing its oxidative stability. The results demonstrated MP could inhibit AKO oxidation, and vice versa, especially when ascorbyl palmitate was added at the same time. As a result, this finding explored a new potential wall material with antioxidative ability for the encapsulated products of AKO.																	0022-1147	1750-3841				NOV	2020	85	11					3797	3805		10.1111/1750-3841.15500		OCT 2020					WOS:000577981100001	33067851

Spatial and temporal operation of the Scotia Sea ecosystem: a review of large-scale links in a krill centred food web	PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES												The Scotia Sea ecosystem is a major component of the circumpolar Southern Ocean system, where productivity and predator demand for prey are high. The eastward-flowing Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) and waters from the Weddell-Scotia Confluence dominate the physics of the Scotia Sea, leading to a strong advective flow, intense eddy activity and mixing. There is also strong seasonality, manifest by the changing irradiance and sea ice cover, which leads to shorter summers in the south. Summer phytoplankton blooms, which at times can cover an area of more than 0.5 million km(2), probably result from the mixing of micronutrients into surface waters through the flow of the ACC over the Scotia Arc. This production is consumed by a range of species including Antarctic krill, which are the major prey item of large seabird and marine mammal populations. The flow of the ACC is steered north by the Scotia Arc, pushing polar water to lower latitudes, carrying with it krill during spring and summer, which subsidize food webs around South Georgia and the northern Scotia Arc. There is also marked interannual variability in winter sea ice distribution and sea surface temperatures that is linked to southern hemisphere-scale climate processes such as the El Nino-Southern Oscillation. This variation affects regional primary and secondary production and influences biogeochemical cycles. It also affects krill population dynamics and dispersal, which in turn impacts higher trophic level predator foraging, breeding performance and population dynamics. The ecosystem has also been highly perturbed as a result of harvesting over the last two centuries and significant ecological changes have also occurred in response to rapid regional warming during the second half of the twentieth century. This combination of historical perturbation and rapid regional change highlights that the Scotia Sea ecosystem is likely to show significant change over the next two to three decades, which may result in major ecological shifts.

Since krill abundance is a crucial factor in Antarctic ecosystem functioning, its monitoring supplies vital data. Acoustic surveys are an effective approach to estimating krill abundance. An acoustic survey was conducted in the western Ross Sea in January 2014-10 years after a similar survey by our team - to estimate krill abundance and biomass and monitor oceanographic conditions. Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) was detected in the northern part of the western Ross Sea and dense swarms of ice krill (Euphausia crystallorophias) were found in its central coastal area. Data analysis revealed an inverse correlation between E. superba density and salinity in the water column, whereas a positive correlation was found between E. crystallorophias abundance and fluorescence; the latter relationship was confirmed in thematic maps of E. crystallorophias spatial distribution and fluorescence. Comparison of 2004 and 2014 biomass data showed a much greater abundance of both species in the more recent survey. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In the austral autumn we observed an extremely high density (5.1 whales per km(2)) of humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) feeding on a super-aggregation of Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) in Wilhelmina Bay. The krill biomass was approximately 2 million tons, distributed over an area of 100 km(2) at densities of up to 2000 individuals m(-3); reports of such 'super-aggregations' of krill have been absent in the scientific literature for >20 years. Retentive circulation patterns in the Bay entrained phytoplankton and meso-zooplankton that were grazed by the krill. Tagged whales rested during daylight hours and fed intensively throughout the night as krill migrated toward the surface. We infer that the previously unstudied WAP embayments are important foraging areas for whales during autumn and, furthermore, that meso-scale variation in the distribution of whales and their prey are important features of this system. Recent decreases in the abundance of Antarctic krill around the WAP have been linked to reductions in sea ice, mediated by rapid climate change in this area. At the same time, baleen whale populations in the Southern Ocean, which feed primarily on krill, are recovering from past exploitation. Consideration of these features and the effects of climate change on krill dynamics are critical to managing both krill harvests and the recovery of baleen whales in the Southern Ocean.

According to the results of FTIR and mass spectrometry, chelating site of calcium ions may possibly involve the carbonal or amino groups of Gln, Ile and Arg residues. Molecular dynamic simulation showed the conformation of peptide was markedly varied, and the distance between calcium ion and Gln and Ile residues was changing all the time. However, the distance between calcium ion and carboxyl oxygen of arginine residues was not changed significantly from 2 ns to 100 ns.

Close coupling between ammonium uptake by phytoplankton and excretion by Antarctic krill, Euphausia superba	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART I-OCEANOGRAPHIC RESEARCH PAPERS												In this study we examined the hypothesis that, under conditions of replete macronutrients and iron in the Southern Ocean, phytoplankton abundance and specific N uptake rates are influenced strongly by the processes of grazing and NH4 regeneration. NH4 and NO3 uptake rates by marine phytoplankton were measured to the northeast and northwest of the island of South Georgia during January-February 1998. Mean specific uptake rate for NO3 (vNO(3)) was 0.0026 h(-1) (range 0.0013-0.0065 h(-1)) and for NH4 (vNH(4)) was 0.0097 h(-1) (0.0014-0.0376 h(-1)). vNH(4) was related positively with NH4 availability, which ranged from 0.1 to 1.5 mmol m(-3) within the upper mixed layer. Ambient NH4 concentrations and vNH(4) were both positively related to local krill biomass values, computed from mean values along acoustic transect segments within 2 km of the uptake measurement stations. These biomass values ranged from similar to 1 g krill fresh mass m(-2) in the northwest to >4 kg krill wet mass m(-2) in the northeast. In contrast to the variability found with NH4 concentrations and uptake rates, vNO(3) was more uniform across the sampling sites. Under these conditions, increasing NH4 concentration appeared to represent an additional N resource. However, high vNH(4) tended to be found for stations with lower phytoplankton standing stocks, across a total range of 0.24-20 mg chlorophyll a m(-3). These patterns suggest a coupling between phytoplankton biomass, vNH(4) and krill in this region of variable but high krill biomass. Locally high concentrations of krill in parts of the study area appeared to have two opposing effects. On the one hand they could graze down phytoplankton stocks, but on the other hand, their NH4 excretion supported enhanced uptake rates by the remaining, ungrazed cells. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Reid, K				Reid, K			Growth rates of Antarctic fur seals as indices of environmental conditions	MARINE MAMMAL SCIENCE												The growth rates of Antarctic fur seal (Arctocephalus gazella) pups estimated from weighing cross-sections of the population were compared with measured/ inferred changes in the availability of their main prey species, Antarctic krill (Eupkausia superba) from 1989 to 2000. There was no relationship between growth rate and mass at weaning and there were counter-intuitive indications of higher growth rates in years of low krill availability. Biases reflecting changes in the component of the population available for sampling appear to invalidate the widely held assumption that interannual differences in growth rate can reliably he derived from differences in the slope of a linear relationship based on cross-sectional population samples. A new index was developed, based on the deviation of pup mass at age in each year compared to the multiyear mean, that was not dependent on assumptions of linearity. The indices of growth deviates produced a more logical relationship with other indices of pup development and related more appropriately to variations in prey availability. The potential impact of methodological biases on the interpretation of growth rate suggests that comparisons of growth rates should not rely on assumptions regarding the underlying growth pattern.																	0824-0469	1748-7692				APR	2002	18	2					469	482		10.1111/j.1748-7692.2002.tb01049.x							WOS:000175164000010						
J	Chen, YC; Jaczynski, J				Chen, Yi-Chen; Jaczynski, Jacek			Gelation of protein recovered from whole antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) by isoelectric solubilization/precipitation as affected by functional additives	JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL AND FOOD CHEMISTRY												This study demonstrated that the novel isoelectric solubilization/precipitation can be applied to recover functional muscle protein in a continuous mode from whole Antarctic krill. Protein recovered from whole krill had a much lower ash content than whole krill, suggesting good removal of inedible impurities (shell, appendages, etc.). Lipids were retained to a higher degree with krill protein solubilized at acidic rather than basic pH. The viscoelastic modulus (G') showed that recovered krill protein failed to form heat-induced gel unless beef plasma protein (BPP) was added. Therefore, protease inhibitors are suggested for development of krill-derived products. Even with BPP, the G' decreased between 45 and 55 degrees C. However, krill protein solubilized at acidic pH had a higher decrease of the G' than the protein solubilized at basic pH, likely due to krill endogenous cathepsin L. Krill protein-based gels developed from protein solubilized at basic pH, especially pH 12.0, had better texture (torsion and Kramer tests and texture profile analysis) than acidic counterparts, possibly due to higher proteolysis and denaturation at acidic pH. Gels made from protein solubilized at acidic pH were brighter and whiter likely due to a higher lipid content.

The basal diet contained 51% of fish meal. Based on it, five isonitrogenous and isolipidic experimental diets were formulated with the protein replacement ratio of fish meal by krill meal as 0, 15%, 30%, 60% and 100%, respectively (DM0, DM15, DM30, DM60 and DM100, respectively). After an 8-week feeding trial, results showed that increasing levels of dietary krill meal linearly and quadratically increased significantly FBW, SGR and FI (P < 0.05). Significant positive linear trends were found between the increasing levels of dietary krill meal and carotenoid concentrations, redness (a*), yellowness (b*) and chroma (C*) in muscle; and significant negative trends were found in the lightness (L*) and hue (H*) responses (P < 0.05). The pH and liquid holding capacity (LHC) were not affected by dietary krill meal levels (P > 0.05). A positive quadratic trend was found between the dietary krill meal level and the springiness, and a negative linear trend in cohesiveness occurred (P < 0.05). The content of fluorine in vertebra increased linearly and quadratically significantly (P < 0.05) but the content of fluorine in muscle was not significantly affected by increasing levels of dietary krill meal (P > 0.05). The highest fluorine content in muscle was within the safe edible limit for humans. These results suggested that Antarctic krill meal could improve the growth performance and muscle pigmentation of triploid rainbow trout farmed in seawater.																	0044-8486	1873-5622				JUL 15	2019	509						72	84		10.1016/j.aquaculture.2019.05.013							WOS:000471749800011

Krill demography and large-scale distribution in the Western Indian Ocean sector of the Southern Ocean (CCAMLR Division 58.4.2) in Austral summer of 2006	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY												Krill demography was studied during a large-scale survey of the South Western Indian sector of the Southern Ocean conducted in late January to late February 2006 (BROKE-West). The survey progressed from 30 degrees E in late January to 80 degrees E in late February and was bounded in the North by 62 degrees S. The average krill density calculated from the catches of the RMT 8 net for four geographical strata ranged from 0.84-68 individuals per 1000 m(-3), with overall mean of 6.7 individuals per 1000 m(-3). Krill distribution and its population structure were analysed using cluster and mixture analysis of the length frequency distribution, showing small sized krill (modal size of 25-30 mm) broadly distributed in the centre of the western area whereas middle and large sized krill (modal size of 35-45 mm and 45-55 mm, respectively) mainly distributed in the middle and eastern half of the survey area. These findings are discussed in the context of the observed geographic and oceanographic structures; the continental slope area, fronts, currents and gyres. Proportional recruitment indices ranged 0.089-0.226 for R1 (age 1+ recruitment) and 0.204-0.440 for R2 (age 2+ recruitment) in the four strata. Recruitment analysis revealed differences between western and eastern halves of the surveyed area, suggesting the possible existence of separate self-sustaining populations linked to the Weddell Gyre and Prydz Bay Gyre systems. Krill larvae were mainly observed along the shelf break, implying the early onset of spawning in mid-November. The series of coastal polynyas developing in the early spring may be one of the important habitats allowing use of early season phytoplankton growth for early maturation and spawning, and those larvae would be transported westwards by the coastal current along the shelf slope.

We examined swarms across the Scotia Sea in January and February 2003 using a Simrad EK60 (38 and 120 kHz) echosounder, concurrent with net sampling. The acoustic data were analysed through applying a swarm-identification algorithm and then filtering out all non-krill targets. The area, length, height, depth, packing-concentration and inter-swarm distance of 4525 swarms was derived by this method. Hierarchical clustering revealed 2 principal swarm types, which differed in both their dimensions and packing-concentrations. Type 1 swarms were generally small (<50 m long) and were not very tightly packed (<10 in.m(-3)), whereas type 2 swarms were an order of magnitude larger and had packing concentrations up to 10 times greater. Further subdivisions of these types identified small and standard swarms within the type 1 group and large and superswarms within the type 2 group. A minor group (swarm type 3) was also found, containing swarms that were isolated (>100 km away from the next swarm). The distribution of swarm types over the survey grid was examined with respect to a number of potential explanatory variables describing both the environment and the internal-state of krill (namely maturity, body length, body condition). Most variables were spatially averaged over scales of similar to 100 km and so mainly had a mesoscale perspective. The exception was the level of light (photosynthetically active radiation (PAR)) for which measurements were specific to each swarm. A binary logistic model was constructed from four variables found to have significant explanatory power (P < 0.05): surface fluorescence, PAR, krill maturity and krill body length. Larger (type 2) swarms were more commonly found during nighttime or when it was overcast during the day, when surface fluorescence was low, and when the krill were small and immature. A strong pattern of diel vertical migration was not observed although the larger and denser swarms tended to occur more often at night than during the day. The vast majority of krill were contained within a minor fraction of the total number of swarms. These krill-rich swarms were more common in areas dominated by small and immature krill. We propose that, at the mesoscale level, the structure of swarms switches from being predominantly large and tightly packed to smaller and more diffuse as krill grow and mature. This pattern is further modulated according to feeding conditions and then level of light. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Its central position in the food web, the ongoing environmental changes due to climatic warming, and increasing commercial interest on this species emphasize the urgency of understanding the adaptability of krill to its environment. Krill has evolved rhythmic physiological and behavioral functions which are synchronized with the daily and seasonal cycles of the complex Southern Ocean ecosystem. The mechanisms, however, leading to these rhythms are essentially unknown. Here, we show that krill possesses an endogenous circadian clock that governs metabolic and physiological output rhythms. We found that expression of the canonical clock gene cry2 was highly rhythmic both in a light-dark cycle and in constant darkness. We detected a remarkable short circadian period, which we interpret as a special feature of the krill's circadian clock that helps to entrain the circadian system to the extreme range of photoperiods krill is exposed to throughout the year. Furthermore, we found that important key metabolic enzymes of krill showed bimodal circadian oscillations (similar to 9-12 h period) in transcript abundance and enzymatic activity. Oxygen consumption of krill showed similar to 9-12 h oscillations that correlated with the temporal activity profile of key enzymes of aerobic energy metabolism. Our results demonstrate the first report of an endogenous circadian timing system in Antarctic krill and its likely link to metabolic key processes. Krill's circadian clock may not only be critical for synchronization to the solar day but also for the control of seasonal events. This study provides a powerful basis for the investigation into the mechanisms of temporal synchronization in this marine key species and will also lead to the first comprehensive analyses of the circadian clock of a polar marine organism through the entire photoperiodic cycle.

According to the Fischer ratio, granular activated carbon of XHJ-200 (200mesh) showed the best way to remove aromatic amino acids and its optimal parameters were pH value of 6.0, adsorption time of 2.5hr, temperature of 25 degrees C, and solid-liquid ratio of 1:20. The Fischer ratio and average molecular weight of HFP were 21.12 (>20) and 779.9Da, respectively. In addition, the peptide profile of HFP was established using RP-HPLC and 23 oligopeptides isolated from HFP including 6 dipeptides, 9 tripeptides, 3 tetrapeptides, and 5 pentapeptides were identified using protein amino acid sequence analyzer and mass spectrum. Furthermore, HFP exhibited high radical scavenging activity, reducing power, and lipid peroxidation inhibition capability. Practical applicationsHigh Fischer ratio oligopeptides (HFO) is a kind of small peptide mixture with the mole ratio of branched-chain amino acids (BCAA) to aromatic amino acids (AAA) higher than 20, which has drawn a great attention due to its great potential in clinical nutrition approaches for the treatment of liver disease when amino acid composition is out of proportion characterized by low levels of BCAA and high levels of AAA in the systemic blood. Antarctic krill is regarded as the largest animal protein resource for various food and pharmaceutical products. However, there is no report on the preparation of HFO of Antarctic krill (HFP). Therefore, the aim of the present study was to investigate the preparation process, peptide profiles and in vitro antioxidant activity of HFP. This study will potentially enhance the value-added utilization of Antarctic krill by making it an important raw material in the health-promoting functional products.																	0145-8884	1745-4514				MAY	2019	43	5							e12827	10.1111/jfbc.12827							WOS:000468395500011	31353526

Mercedes			Size structure of Antarctic krill inferred from samples of Pygoscelid penguin diets and those collected by the commercial krill fishery	MARINE BIOLOGY												In the Antarctic Peninsula, during the chick-rearing period Adelie (Pygoscelis adeliae) and gentoo (P. papua) penguins feed primarily on Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba), which is also exploited by the commercial fishery. Krill length and proportion of juvenile krill consumed by these predators that breed at Stranger Point, South Shetland Islands (from 2007/2008 to 2015/2016), and those collected by the krill fishery in the Mar de la Flota/Bransfield Strait (from 2009/2010 to 2015/2016) were compared to evaluate the potential of each data source as an indicator of changes in the size composition and so, in the demographic structure of the krill population. Overall, the mean krill size taken by gentoo penguins was larger than that ingested by Adelie penguins, which consumed higher proportions of juvenile (<= 35 mm) and one-year-old (<= 25 mm) krill. Although the krill size caught by the fishery was statistically similar to that taken by both penguin species, there were differences in the frequency distributions of krill size among the three databases. Furthermore, when only adult krill (> 35 mm) was considered, the three sources of krill data showed a similar inter-annual variation in the availability of adult krill cohorts. Our findings suggest that each database analysed here can potentially provide different information (although complementary) about krill size composition. In addition, inter-annual fluctuations in the smaller size classes of krill likely reflect their first year of recruitment and, therefore, may be used as an indicator of shifts in local krill availability.

Herein, a lipidomics method for in situ monitoring of the dynamic oxidation characteristics in AKO was explored based on electric soldering iron ion source (ESII) coupling with rapid evaporative ionization mass spectrometry (REIMS). The lipidomics profiles of AKO at different storage periods were successfully acquired. On the basis of principal component analysis and orthogonal partial least-squares analysis, the obtained REIMS data were employed to build a multivariate recognition model. The ions of m/z 707.50, 721.50, 833.49, and 837.54 contributed the most significant effect on the multivariate data model for the authentication of different AKO samples. Besides, the variation of viscosity, astaxanthin, and volatile compounds were also evaluated to corroborate the oxidation characteristics. The results indicated that the ESII-REIMS technology could be applied as an advanced rapid detection method to secure oil and fat quality during storage.

Winter preconditioning determines feeding ecology of Euphausia superba in the Antarctic Peninsula	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												We examined the feeding ecology and lipid composition of Antarctic krill Euphausia superba around the northern Antarctic Peninsula from 2001 to 2012. We used lipid biomarkers to quantify feeding patterns and relate the variability in biomarkers to environmental conditions that structure the phytoplankton community. Fatty acid profiles varied among years, with some years dominated by lipids indicative of herbivory, while other years were indicative of greater omnivory. Principal component analysis of 60 fatty acids showed that 3 principal components (PCs) explained approximately 50% of the variability in fatty acid profiles. The first PC separated the fatty acid indicators along a herbivory-omnivory-carnivory gradient. Correlations between the gradient of herbivory and carnivory, as summarized by the first PC, were found with both winter sea ice extent (r = 0.55, p < 0.01) and with ENSO conditions the previous winter (r = 0.88, p < 0.001). These findings suggest that climatic conditions during the late winter precondition the pelagic ecosystem around the Antarctic Peninsula, impacting the trophic ecology of Antarctic krill the following summer.																	0171-8630	1616-1599				JAN 20	2015	519						89	101		10.3354/meps11082							WOS:000349093800007

Bengtson			Aqueous uptake and sublethal toxicity of p,p '-DDE in non-feeding larval stages of Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba)	ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION												This study evaluated the toxicological sensitivity of non-feeding larval stages of a key Antarctic species (Antarctic krill, Euphausia superba) to p,p'-dichlorodiphenyl dichloroethylene (p,p'-DDE) exposure. The aqueous uptake clearance rate of 84 mL g(-1) preserved weight (p.w.) h(-1) determined for p,p'-DDE in Antarctic krill larvae is comparable to previous findings for small cold water crustaceans and five times slower than the rates reported for an amphipod inhabiting warmer waters. Natural variations in larval physiology appear to influence contaminant uptake and larval krill behavioural responses, strongly highlighting the importance of time of measurement for ecotoxicological testing. Sublethal narcosis (immobility) was observed in larval Antarctic krill from p,p'-DDE body residues of 0.2 mmol/kg p.w., which is in agreement with findings for adult krill and temperate aquatic species. The finding of comparable body residue-based toxicity of p,p'-DDE between polar and temperate species supports the tissue residue approach for environmental risk assessment of polar ecosystems.

We considered DVM in relation to krill body length, based on Japanese krill fishery data (1990-2012), and examined DVM in relation to food availability and predator (Antarctic fur seal) avoidance. We report that diel changes in median trawling depth (a proxy for krill vertical distribution) showed significant interannual variation; the overall trend was such that during both daytime and nighttime, the larger the average size of krill, the deeper their median depth. Consistent with the literature, this size-dependent DVM relates to food availability and size-dependent diet; that is, with increasing body length, krill tend to rely less on phytoplankton (which are available in surface layers) as a winter food source. Concerning predator avoidance, and based on analyses using an optimal foraging dive model for fur seals, DVM showed close agreement with size-dependent predation risk; that is, larger krill remained deeper, thereby reducing mortality from fur seals. Therefore, DVM of overwintering krill appears to reflect a compromise between adequate feeding conditions and minimizing predation risk. There was, however, an exception that krill occurred at a shallow depth in winter 2006 when phytoplankton abundance was particularly low and krill density was very high. This supports the hypothesis that physiological demands (i.e. hunger) may become a more important factor affecting DVM than predator avoidance under conditions of insufficient food availability.																	0171-8630	1616-1599				NOV 12	2020	654						53	66		10.3354/meps13508							WOS:000621236300004

The winter pack-ice zone provides a sheltered but food-poor habitat for larval Antarctic krill	NATURE ECOLOGY & EVOLUTION												A dominant Antarctic ecological paradigm suggests that winter sea ice is generally the main feeding ground for krill larvae. Observations from our winter cruise to the southwest Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean contradict this view and present the first evidence that the pack-ice zone is a food-poor habitat for larval development. In contrast, the more open marginal ice zone provides a more favourable food environment for high larval krill growth rates. We found that complex under-ice habitats are, however, vital for larval krill when water column productivity is limited by light, by providing structures that offer protection from predators and to collect organic material released from the ice. The larvae feed on this sparse ice-associated food during the day. After sunset, they migrate into the water below the ice (upper 20 m) and drift away from the ice areas where they have previously fed. Model analyses indicate that this behaviour increases both food uptake in a patchy food environment and the likelihood of overwinter transport to areas where feeding conditions are more favourable in spring.

SPATIAL DISTRIBUTION OF MANAGEMENT MEASURES, ANTARCTIC KRILL CATCH AND SOUTHERN OCEAN BIOREGIONS: IMPLICATIONS FOR CONSERVATION PLANNING	CCAMLR SCIENCE												Systematic conservation planning for developing marine spatial protection includes analysis of the spatial distribution of fishing activities, existing management and ecological characteristics. This paper assesses the overlap between habitat (bioregion), existing spatial management and Antarctic krill catch in the Southern Ocean. The analysis required standardised information on the location and extent of spatial fisheries management measures, which was delivered through a Geographic Information System (GIS). During the 2010/11 season, 64% of the CAMLR Convention Area was open to fishing for at least one species. There were important differences between pelagic bioregions in terms of the fraction that was open to fishing, and the distribution of catch within the open fraction. For example, only 26% of the main area open to krill fishing has been fished, and this fishing is concentrated in three of the seven bioregions found in the open area. Information on the distribution of catches and catch limits among different bioregions could be used to prioritise protection for bioregions that are currently under-represented in marine protected areas (MPAs). However, conservation planning should take account of uncertainties that result from the different spatial resolution of datasets and the use of long-term averages to identify spatial boundaries.

J	Barrera-Oro, E				Barrera-Oro, E			The role of fish in the Antarctic marine food web: differences between inshore and offshore waters in the southern Scotia Arc and west Antarctic Peninsula	ANTARCTIC SCIENCE												The role of fish in the Antarctic food web in inshore and offshore waters is analysed, taking as an example the coastal marine communities of the southern Scotia Arc (South Orkney Islands and South Shetland Islands) and the west Antarctic Peninsula. Inshore, the ecological role of demersal fish is more important than that of krill. There, demersal fish are major consumers of benthos and also feed on zooplankton (mainly krill in summer). They are links between lower and upper levels of the food web and are common prey of other fish, birds and seats. Offshore, demersal fish depend less on benthos and feed more on zooplankton (mainly krill) and nekton, and are less accessible as prey of birds and seals. There, pelagic fish (especially lantern fish) are more abundant than inshore and play an important role in the energy flow from macrozooplankton to higher trophic levels (seabirds and seals). Through the higher fish predators, energy is transferred to land in the form of fish remains, pellets (birds), regurgitation and faeces (birds and seals). However, in the general context of the Antarctic marine ecosystem, krill (Euphausia superba) plays the central role in the food web because it is the main food source in terms of biomass for most of the high level predators from demersal fish up to whales. This has no obvious equivalent in other marine ecosystems. In Antarctic offshore coastal and oceanic waters the greatest proportion of energy from the ecosystem is transferred to land directly through krill consumers, such as flying birds, penguins, and seals. Beside krill, the populations of fish in the Antarctic Ocean are the second most important element for higher predators, in particular the energy-rich pelagic Myctophidae in open waters and the pelagic Antarctic silver fish (Pleuragramma antarcticum) in the high Antarctic zone. Although the occurrence of these pelagic fish inshore has been poorly documented, their abundance in neritic waters could be higher than previously believed.																	0954-1020					DEC	2002	14	4					293	309		10.1017/S0954102002000111							WOS:000181258200002

Understanding fishery-induced stress levels and the recovery period of escapees is therefore crucial for predicting total fishing-induced mortality. Hemolymph lactate concentration is commonly used as an index of physiological stress in many crustacean species, and the clearing time of lactate back to normal levels indicates the ability to recover from stress. We measured the hemolymph lactate concentration in three groups of Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba Dana, 1850): Group 1, trawl escapees collected during fishing; Group 2, specimens subjected to simulated mesh penetration; and Group 3, an onboard acclimated control group. Individuals that had escaped the trawl during fishing had the highest concentrations of hemolymph lactate (mean > 6 mmol-l). Exposure to mesh penetration was in itself not stressful, as hemolymph lactate concentrations did not differ significantly between Group 2 and the control Group (mean 0.8 mmol-l versus 0.7 mmol-l, respectively). Additional stress factors during the capture and handling process likely added to the elevated lactate levels observed in Group 1. For the trawl escapees, the lactate clearance time during stress recovery was modeled as a function of exponential decay. Hemolymph lactate levels did not differ significantly among the three groups after 200 min, which suggested that Antarctic krill recovered from fishery-induced stress within this time period.

J	REID, K				REID, K			THE DIET OF ANTARCTIC FUR SEALS (ARCTOCEPHALUS-GAZELLA PETERS 1875) DURING WINTER AT SOUTH GEORGIA	ANTARCTIC SCIENCE												The diet of mainly adult and sub-adult male Antarctic fur seals (Arctocephalus gazella) was investigated during the austral winters of 1992 and 1993 using faecal (seat) analysis. Of samples containing identifiable prey remains (n=376), c. 28% contained krill alone, c. 37% contained fish alone and c. 35% contained both krill and fish. The mean size of krill taken was smaller than in summer due to the absence of large adult krill of 55-60 mm total length. Of the 25 fish taxa taken, krill-feeding species predominated, especially in seats that also contained krill. Non-krill feeding species were more abundant in seats containing fish alone. The mackerel icefish (Champsocephalus gunnari Lonnberg 1905), which feeds mainly on krill, was the most important fish species in terms of absolute frequency (53%), frequency of occurrence (69%) and estimated biomass (47%); fur seals may have a significant impact on local stocks of this species. Cephalopods and pelagic fish (myctophids) were of minor importance in the diet (<2%). The importance of krill and krill-feeding fish species suggests that the male fur seals, which are present around South Georgia in winter, are targeting their foraging on a krill and fish community, probably associated with krill aggregations.																	0954-1020					SEP	1995	7	3					241	249		10.1017/S0954102095000344							WOS:A1995RT41400005

Under laboratory conditions, larvae were starved for 0, 5, 10, 15, 20 and 25 days, and their R-cells were investigated by transmission electron microscope. R-cells are thought to play a role in the storage and absorption of nutrients. In fed larvae, numerous mitochondria scattered homogenously, and densely packed microvilli were observed on the apical surface of R-cells. After 5 days of starvation, mitochondria were swollen and were found concentrated in the apical region in R-cells. A decrease in cell volume and an increase in thickness of the basal lamina with many irregular infoldings were observed after 10-15 days of starvation. Lipid droplets were rarely found in the R-cells regardless of whether larvae had been fed or starved suggesting an inability to store lipid. Without the ability to store energy in the form of lipid, survival would be dependant on sourcing continuous food until maturation.

Amino Acid and Mineral Composition of Protein and Other Components and Their Recovery Yields from Whole Antarctic Krill (Euphausia superba) Using Isoelectric Solubilization/Precipitation	JOURNAL OF FOOD SCIENCE												Proteins and insolubles were recovered from whole Antarctic krill via novel isoelectric solubilization/precipitation using different pH treatments. The protein recovery yield was 45% to 50% ( dry basis). The recovered proteins had higher (P < 0.05) content of essential amino acids (EAAs) and non-EAAs as well as higher ( P < 0.05) ratio of total EAA/total AA than whole krill. The EAAs constituted almost 50% of total AAs. The least extreme pH treatments (pHs 3 and 12) yielded highest ( P < 0.05) content of EAAs. The quality of recovered proteins was high based on EAAs meeting FAO/WHO/UNU recommendations for adults and infants. The basic pH yielded proteins with the lowest (P < 0.05) amount of minerals and the highest (P < 0.05) amount of Ca, P, and Mg in the insolubles when compared to the acidic treatments. However, both basic and acidic treatments effectively removed minerals from recovered proteins without the removal of the exoskeleton before processing. Therefore, besides high-quality proteins, the insolubles may provide a mineral supplement in the animal diet.

The carapace matters: refinement of the instantaneous growth rate method for Antarctic krill Euphausia superba Dana, 1850 (Euphausiacea)	JOURNAL OF CRUSTACEAN BIOLOGY												Growth of Antarctic krill Euphausia superba Dana, 1850 is commonly calculated using the Instantaneous Growth Rate (IGR) method based on the difference between the uropod lengths of the moulted exoskeleton and the uropod lengths after moulting. To date, this method has not accounted for sex-dependent differences in body proportion, relying only upon uropod measurements. We measured the carapace, uropod, and total body lengths of gravid females, non-gravid females, males, and juvenile krill from the Indian Sector of the Southern Ocean. Growth rates derived using a combination of the carapace and uropod measurements for gravid females were different from those derived through the traditional uropod-only based IGR, whereas non-gravid females, male, and juvenile growth rates showed no significant difference between methods. The refined method we propose successfully reflects dimorphism in growth between the sexes of krill, with gravid females having enlarged carapaces during the reproductive season. The interaction between growth and reproduction must be considered to improve the reliability of predictions from krill life history models, which is possible through the use of sex-dependent IGR measurements. We propose that, whenever possible, measurements of carapace and total length should be made along with uropod measurements. Together with assessments of maturity stages of krill that did not moult during experiments, these measurements will aid in further informing krill stock assessments.

This resource is a keystone species in the Antarctic food web, sustaining the contribution to the trophic ecology of many invertebrate and vertebrate species. To catch hill, part of the fleet in this fishery uses large mid-water nets that also retain a diversity of other organisms like plankton, meroplankton, and fish species as bycatch. Therefore, it is necessary to understand and evaluate the magnitude of this incidental catch, as well as the potential interactions between hill fishing gear with seabirds and mammals. To estimate the composition and extent of bycatch for this fishery included 784 samples of 25 kg and an equal number of 1 kg sub-samples obtained from Antarctic hill catches in Subarea 48, between years 2012 and 2016. A total of 15 fish species were identified along with the record of five other taxa and other unidentified specimens. The most relevant fish species bycaught by weight were mackerel icefish Champsocephalus gunnari, South Georgia icefish Pseudochaenichthys georgianus, and painted notie Lepidonotothen larseni. Additionally, 20 interactions with seabirds and nine interactions with Antarctic fur seals (Arctocephalus gazella) were registered. In the five years of operations, only three seabirds died, and only two individuals of A. gazelle caught by the net were killed.																	0718-560X	0717-7178					2020	48	3					429	439		10.3856/vol48-issue3-fulltext-2434							WOS:000547330500008

Due to krill endogenous proteases ISP-KPI barely forms gel which is a major hurdle in wide application of this tremendous protein source for direct human consumption. The objective was to improve gelation and elucidate interaction mechanism between kappa-carrageenan and KPI kappa-Carrageenan was added to KPI at 0.00, 0.75, 1.50, 2.25, and 3.00 g/150 g and heated at 90 degrees C for 15 min. Added' kappa-carrageenan improved texture of KPI gels. However, the level of addition had minimal effect. SDS-PAGE revealed severe proteolysis of KPI even during heating. Total and free sulfhydryl were not different, while surface hydrophobicity and water-holding-capacity slightly decreased and increased, respectively with added kappa-carrageenan. Fourier-transform-infrared-spectroscopy showed none-tominimal shift of beta-sheet and alpha-helical protein structure; while C-C and C-O stretching as well as C-H bending of kappa-carrageenan showed the greatest shift, indicating that kappa-carrageenan was mainly responsible for gel formation.																	0308-8146	1873-7072				APR 25	2019	278						644	652		10.1016/j.foodchem.2018.11.080							WOS:000453529300081	30583424

Previous work has shown a general in-shore migration of krill in winter in this region; however, the very near-shore has not often been sampled as part of these surveys. We investigated distribution, abundance, and size structure of krill in 3 fjordic bays along the peninsula, and in the adjacent Gerlache Strait area using vertically stratified MOCNESS net tows and ADCP acoustic biomass estimates. Krill abundance was high within bays, with net estimated densities exceeding 60 krill m(-3), while acoustic estimates were an order of magnitude higher. Krill within bays were larger than krill in the Gerlache Strait. Within bays, krill aggregations were observed near the seafloor during the day with aggregations extending to the sediment interface, and exhibited diel vertical migration higher into the water column at night. We suggest these high winter krill abundances within fjords are indicative of an active seasonal migration by krill in the peninsula region. Potential drivers for such a migration include reduced advective losses and costs, and availability of sediment food resources within fjords. Seasonally near-shore krill may also affect stock and recruitment assessments and may have implications for managing the krill fishery in this area.																	0171-8630	1616-1599				JUN 23	2016	552						115	129		10.3354/meps11772							WOS:000379812200009

Bengtson			Dietary exposure of Antarctic krill to p,p '-DDE: Uptake kinetics and toxicological sensitivity in a key polar species	ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION												This study evaluated the dietary uptake kinetics and sublethal toxicity of p,p'-dichlorodiphenyl dichloroethylene (p,p'-DDE) in Antarctic krill. The uptake rate constant (characterised by the seawater volume stripped of contaminant sorbed to algae) of 200 +/- 032 mL g(-1) wet weight h(-1), average absorption efficiency of 86 +/- 13% and very low elimination rate constant of 5 x 10(-6) +/- 0.0031 h(-1) demonstrate the importance of feeding for p,p'-DDE bioaccumulation in Antarctic krill. Faecal egestion of unabsorbed p,p'-DDE of 8.1 +/- 2.7% indicates that this pathway contributes considerably to p,p'-DDE sinking fluxes. A median internal effective concentration (IEC50) of 15 mmol/kg lipid weight for complete immobility indicates baseline toxicity and that Antarctic krill exhibit comparable toxicological sensitivity as temperate species under similar 10 d exposure conditions. These findings support the critical body residue approach and provide insight to the role of Antarctic krill in the biogeochemical cycling of p,p'-DDE in the Southern Ocean. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Distance sampling data were used to produce density surface models for humpback (Megaptera novaeangliae) and fin whales (Balaenoptera physalus) around the West Antarctic Peninsula (WAP). Abundance for both species was estimated over two strata in the Bransfield Strait and Drake Passage. Distinct distribution patterns suggest horizontal niche partitioning of the two whale species around the WAP, with fin whales aggregating at the shelf edge of the South Shetland Islands in the Drake Passage and humpback whales in the Bransfield Strait. Krill biomass estimated from the concurrent krill survey was used along with CTD data from the same expedition, bathymetric parameters and satellite data on chlorophyll-a and ice concentration to model krill distribution. Comparisons of the predicted distributions of both whale species with the predicted distributions of Euphausia superba, Euphausia crystallorophias and Thysanoessa macrura suggest a complex relationship rather than a straightforward correlation between krill and whales. However, results indicate that fin whales were feeding in an area dominated by T. macrura, while humpback whales were found in areas of higher E. superba biomass. Our results provide abundance estimates for humpback whales and, for the first time, fin whales in the WAP and contribute important information on feeding ecology and habitat use of these two species in the Southern Ocean.

Extractable pigments from the eye and eyestalk ganglia were quantified using fluorescence intensity and standardised against protein. Three peak fluorescence intensities were detected at wavelengths of excitation 280 nm, emission 625 nm (pigment 1); excitation 355 nm, emission 510 nm (pigment 2); and excitation 463 nm, emission 620 nm (pigment 3). There was a positive correlation between the quantity of pigments 1 and 3 and the age of Antarctic krill. A model was developed to predict age from pigment 3 and to compare it with other age proxies (carapace length and eyeball diameter). The quantity of pigment 3 was the best predictor of age. The pigment method can discriminate between similar sized krill aged 12 and 36 months. Age pigments provide an improved tool for age estimation in Antarctic krill, particularly if used in conjunction with other demographic information.

Variable food absorption by Antarctic krill: Relationships between diet, egestion rate and the composition and sinking rates of their fecal pellets	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY												The kinetics of food processing by zooplankton affects both their energy budgets and the biogeochemical fate of their fecal pellets. We sampled 40 schools of krill across the Scotia Sea during spring, summer and autumn and found that in all 3 seasons, every aspect of their absorption and defecation varied greatly. The C content of fecal pellets varied from 0.85% to 29% of their dry mass (median 9.8%) and C egestion rates varied 75-fold. C:N mass ratios of pellets ranged from 4.9 to 13.2 (median 7.8), higher than values of 3.9 in the krill and 5.4 in their food, pointing to enhanced uptake of N. Pellet sinking rates equated to 27-1218 m d(-1) (median 304 m d(-1)), being governed mainly by pellet diameter (80-600 mu m, mean 183 mu m) and density (1.038-1.391 g cm(-3), mean 1.121 g cm(-3)). Pellets showed little loss of C or N in filtered seawater over the first 2 days and were physically robust. When feeding rates were low, slow gut passage time and high absorption efficiency resulted in low egestion rates of pellets that were low in C and N content. These pellets were compact, dense and fast-sinking. Conversely, in good feeding conditions much food tended to pass quickly through the gut and was not efficiently absorbed, producing C and N-rich, slow-sinking pellets. Such "superfluous feeding" probably maximises the absolute rates of nutrient absorption. Food composition was also important: diatom-rich diets depressed the C content of the pellets but increased their sinking rates, likely due to silica ballasting. So depending on how krill process food, their pellets could represent both vehicles for rapid export and slow sinking, C and N-rich food sources for pelagic scavengers. C egestion rates by krill averaged 3.4% of summer primary production (and ingestion rates would be 2-10-fold higher than this) so whatever the fate of the pellets, krill are an important re-packager within the food web. While salp pellets tend to sink faster than those of krill, it is the latter that tend to prevail in sediment traps. We suggest that this is because krill schools are more compact, producing "rain showers" of pellets that exceed the capacity of pelagic scavengers to reprocess them. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

External parasite infestation depends on moult-frequency and age in Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba)	POLAR BIOLOGY												Levels of infestation by the suctorian Ephelota sp. were determined in Antarctic krill taken in the north-eastern region of the Scotia sea, close to the island of South Georgia. Individuals caught in summer between 2002 and 2004 were measured for body length, eye diameter, moult stage, sex, sexual maturity and number of suctorian parasites. All krill samples were found to contain at least two modal size-classes and the complete range of maturity- and moult stages. Sample analysis for the different characters identified moult stage as an important determinant of infestation by Ephelota sp., with 66% of those about to moult (pre-moult individuals) being infested compared with 0% of post-moult individuals. Multiple Correspondence Analysis also identified a strong link between age and degree of suctorian infestation with large-eyed (and hence old) males having very high numbers of suctorian bodies. Moulting is costly in terms of energy and vulnerability, but it is believed that krill moult at relatively high rates throughout their life to facilitate growth and "shrinkage". Here, we demonstrate that the control of external parasitism is also a major advantage of moulting at high frequency. The capacity of krill to maintain a high moult rate decreases with age, leading to older krill enduring higher parasitic loads.																	0722-4060	1432-2056				JAN	2008	31	2					121	130		10.1007/s00300-007-0339-2							WOS:000251231000001

The Southern Ocean is a net sink for many POPs, with a key contribution of the settling fluxes of POPs bound to organic matter (biological pump). However, little is known about POP transfer through the food web in the Southern Ocean and Antarctic waters, where krill is an important ecological node. In this study, we assessed the occurrence of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and furans (PCDD/Fs), polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) from the Bellingshausen, South Scotia and Weddell Seas around the Antarctic Peninsula. The concentrations of PCDD/Fs, PBDEs and PCBs in krill showed a large variability and the average were higher (generally within a factor 3) than those previously reported for eastern Antarctica. This result highlights regional differences related to atmospheric transport and deposition, and also probable regional sources due to human activities. Bioaccumulation and biomagnification factors for PCBs in krill were estimated using previously reported phytoplankton and seawater concentrations for this region. These suggested a near water-krill equilibrium for PCBs, which was not observed for water-phytoplankton partitioning. The estimated removal settling fluxes of PCBs due to the biological pump were several orders ofmagnitude higher than the estimated fluxes of PCBs transferred from phytoplankton to krill.

An impoverished benthic fauna was discovered, that included deep-sea species presumed to be remnants from ice-covered conditions. The current structure of various ecosystem components appears to result from extremely different response rates to the change from an oligotrophic sub-ice-shelf ecosystem to a productive shelf ecosystem. Meiobenthic communities remained impoverished only inside the embayments. On local scales, macro- and mega-epibenthic diversity was generally low, with pioneer species and typical Antarctic megabenthic shelf species interspersed. Antarctic Minke whales and seals utilised the Larsen A/B area to feed on presumably newly established krill and pelagic fish biomass. Ecosystem impacts also extended well beyond the zone of ice-shelf collapse, with areas of high benthic disturbance resulting from scour by icebergs discharged from the Larsen embayments.

Available information supports the existence of an endogenous timing system in krill enabling it to synchronize metabolism and behavior with an environment characterized by extreme seasonal changes in terms of day length, food availability, and surface ice extent. A screening of our transcriptome database "KrillDB" allowed us to identify the putative orthologues of 20 circadian clock components. Mapping of conserved domains and phylogenetic analyses strongly supported annotations of the identified sequences. Luciferase assays and co-immunoprecipitation experiments allowed us to define the role of the main clock components. Our findings provide an overall picture of the molecular mechanisms underlying the functioning of the endogenous circadian clock in the Antarctic krill and shed light on their evolution throughout crustaceans speciation. Interestingly, the core clock machinery shows both mammalian and insect features that presumably contribute to an evolutionary strategy to cope with polar environment's challenges. Moreover, despite the extreme variability characterizing the Antarctic seasonal day length, the conserved light mediated degradation of the photoreceptor EsCRY1 suggests a persisting pivotal role of light as a Zeitgeber.

This study aimed to evaluate the thickening function of heat-induced krill protein fluid gels through the investigation of their flow behavior and microstructure. The microstructure of these physical gels was classified as four types, including particulate gels (pH 5.5), transition state from particulate to branched gels (pH 6.0), loose connected networks (pH 6.8, 7.0, 8.0 and 8.6) and fine cross-linked structure (pH 6.4, 7.2 and 7.5). Gels at pH 5.5 and 7.2 showed significantly higher gel strength in comparison with their counterparts at other pHs. Fluid gels showed characteristic non-Newtonian pseudoplastic behavior with low flow behavior indexes in the shear thinning region. Fluid gels at pH 7.2 showed significantly higher viscosity in comparison with other gels, which was related with its viscoelasticity and microstructure. Fluid gels with branched networks exhibited significantly better water binding capacities than particulate gels. Fluid gels became less pseudoplastic as temperature increased, which resulted from the melting of gels. The thixotropy of fluid gels was demonstrated through loop test, stepwise test and start-up flow experiment. Particulate gels at pH 5.5 showed smaller thixotropy in comparison with branched gels at higher pHs. Fine connected fluid gels showed lower structural recovery than loose cross-linked gels under stepwise test. This resulted from the irreversible damage of fine connected structure under high shear rate. Heat-induced fluid gels of krill protein exhibited thickening function and could be applied in food development with desired requirement. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Auerswald, L; Freier, U; Lopata, A; Meyer, B				Auerswald, Lutz; Freier, Ulrich; Lopata, Andreas; Meyer, Bettina			Physiological and morphological colour change in Antarctic krill, Euphausia superba: a field study in the Lazarev Sea	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY												Antarctic krill, Euphausia superba, is very susceptible to harmful solar radiation because of its unique genetic setup. Exposure occurs in spring to autumn during vertical diel migration and during occasional daytime surface-swarming. We have investigated colour change in Antarctic krill, Euphausia superba, during summer and winter in the Lazarev Sea in response to ultraviolet radiation (UVR) and photosynthetically active radiation (PAR). Short-term physiological colour change and long-term (seasonal) morphological colour change are present. Both are facilitated by a single type of monochromatic red chromatophore, i.e. erythrophores, of 20-450 mu m diameter. Superficial erythrophores cover large dorsal areas, especially above vital organs (brain, sinus glands), additional 'profound' erythrophores cover internal organs (heart, gut, nerve cords). Short-term change in light regime causes rapid physiological colour change along dense bundles of microtubules: pigment disperses into chromorhizae upon exposure to PAR and UVA and to a lesser extent to UVB. Darkness leads to aggregation of pigment in the centre and hence blanching. There is no circadian rhythm in the dispersal state of erythrophores present in winter. Physiological colour change in adult krill is two to three times more rapid in summer than in winter. Furthermore, seasonal changes in light regime also result in a profound morphological colour change: in summer animals, abdominal astaxanthin concentration is 450% and erythrophore count is 250-480% higher than in winter krill. We conclude from our results, that pigmentation of E. superba serves in the protection from harmful solar radiation and is adapted to the varying diel and seasonal light conditions.

The horizontal and vertical scattering layers in the upper 200 m of the water column were known with the existence of predominant ice krill ( > 95%) in this region. Acoustic identification using a two-frequency dB window between S-v at 38 and S-v at 120 kHz separated echoes originating from dominant ice krill from other zooplankton species. The frequency dependence of ice krill at 38 and 120 kHz was examined and the result presented that ice krill might have different acoustic characteristics from other Southern Ocean zooplanlcton species including Euphausia superba. This result could be applied to improve the ability of acoustic identification and precise density estimation of ice krill in the high-latitude coastal waters of Antarctica. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Managing this fishery sustainably, against a backdrop of rapid regional climate change, requires information on distribution and time trends. Many data on the abundance of both taxa have been obtained from net sampling surveys since 1926, but much of this is stored in national archives, sometimes only in notebooks. In order to make these important data accessible we have collated available abundance data (numerical density, no. m(-2)) of postlarval E. superba and salp individual (multiple species, and whether singly or in chains). These were combined into a central database, KRILLBASE, together with environmental information, standardisation and metadata. The aim is to provide a temporal-spatial data resource to support a variety of research such as biogeochemistry, autecology, higher predator foraging and food web modelling in addition to fisheries management and conservation. Previous versions of KRILLBASE have led to a series of papers since 2004 which illustrate some of the potential uses of this database. With increasing numbers of requests for these data we here provide an updated version of KRILLBASE that contains data from 15 194 net hauls, including 12 758 with krill abundance data and 9726 with salp abundance data. These data were collected by 10 nations and span 56 seasons in two epochs (1926-1939 and 1976-2016). Here, we illustrate the seasonal, inter-annual, regional and depth coverage of sampling, and provide both circumpolar-and regional-scale distribution maps. Krill abundance data have been standardised to accommodate variation in sampling methods, and we have presented these as well as the raw data. Information is provided on how to screen, interpret and use KRILLBASE to reduce artefacts in interpretation, with contact points for the main data providers.

The effect of low inclusion levels of Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) meal on growth performance, apparent digestibility and slaughter quality of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar)	AQUACULTURE NUTRITION												Two trials with Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) were conducted to evaluate the potential of krill meal to improve feed intake. In the first experiment, after transfer to sea water, salmon smolts were fed diets added 75 or 150gkg(-1) Antarctic krill meal in substitution for fish meal for 13weeks. The apparent digestibility coefficient for crude protein and the majority of the amino acids was significantly lower in the feeds added krill meal (around 83.5%) than in the control diet (84.9%), whereas the digestibility of crude lipids, dry matter and energy was not significantly different among the three diets. Krill meal addition resulted in higher feed intake, which led to higher growth rates and final body weights. In the second experiment, large salmon were fed a diet containing 100gkg(-1) krill meal for 6weeks before slaughter. Their feed intake and growth performance were assessed, and fillet and visceral fat contents were measured. Salmon fed the 100gkg(-1) krill meal diet tended to eat more, resulting in significantly increased growth rates, when compared to control fish. Fish fed krill meal also had a significantly lower condition factor.																	1353-5773	1365-2095				AUG	2017	23	4					721	729		10.1111/anu.12439							WOS:000405635300008

The aim of this experiment was to investigate the bioavailability of dietary fluoride from either krill shell or sodium fluoride (NaF) to rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss). The second aim was to investigate if the fluoride bioavailability was affected by adding calcium to the feed. Five experimental diets were produced; one control diet and four test diets containing 700 mg fluoride kg(-1) either from NaF or from krill shell, with or without added calcium chloride (15 g Ca kg(-1)). Triplicate groups of fish were given one meal in excess of appetite prior to sampling. Five fish from each replicate tank were terminally sampled for blood; 0, 1, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18,24, and 36 h postprandial. Fluoride in blood plasma was used as an indicator of fluoride absorption. Fish fed NaF showed a clear peak in plasma fluoride of 1.17 mg l(-1) 3 h postprandial, followed by a rapid decline. The fish fed krill shell did not obtain a clear peak but had a maximum fluoride plasma concentration (C(max)) of 0.32 mg l(-1) 3 h postprandial. The addition of dietary calcium reduced the fluoride uptake in fish fed the NaF diet by nearly 100%, while adding calcium to the diets with krill shell reduced the uptake of fluoride to nearly the half. To conclude, fluoride from krill shell had a lower bioavailability than fluoride from NaF. Dietary calcium was an efficient way to reduce the fluoride uptake of rainbow trout reared in fresh water.

J	BUCHHOLZ, F				BUCHHOLZ, F			MOLT CYCLE AND GROWTH OF ANTARCTIC KRILL EUPHAUSIA-SUPERBA IN THE LABORATORY	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												Using systems for long-term maintenance of Antarctic krill Euphausia superba in aquaria, positive growth was measured in a large number of specimens under controlled conditions. The first moult always showed the greatest growth increment. The high laboratory growth rates agreed with previous field investigations. Often-reported 'abnormal' slow and predominantly negative growth was probably due to inadequate maintenance procedures. Moulting was partly synchronous, and moult frequency was temperature dependent. Growth of Antarctic krill did not match the slow rates expected of a polar species. Krill was very sensitive to experimental variation in feeding regime: (1) moult frequency (14 to 29 d) and (2) growth increment at moult (-15 to 21 %) varied together. Ecdysis and the staging and timing of the moult cycle were studied. The stage definitions of Buchholz (1982; Mar. Biol. 66: 301-305) were expanded and are now applicable to frozen krill and for field investigations, and include a simple classification key. Regular histological changes in the integument and consistent changes in the titre of the moult hormone could be attributed to distinct stages of the moult cycle. A clear temporal correlation confirmed the physiological relevance of the staging system. A possible 'resting' stage between post- and pre-ecdysis was not found. The apparent plasticity of growth parameters indicates that, in the wild, krill is able to adapt to strong regional and seasonal changes in feeding conditions, typical for Antarctic waters. Krill grows fast, and in spite of being predominantly planktonic, attains a large size. This enables fast swimming which facilitates location of rich food sources. Favourable feeding conditions immediately initiate growth. Essentially unhindered motility during actual moult and extremely fast ecdysis were interpreted as an adaptation to a pelagic way of life.																	0171-8630					JAN	1991	69	3					217	229		10.3354/meps069217							WOS:A1991EW10900002						
J	Brierley, AS; Reid, K				Brierley, Andrew S.; Reid, Keith			Krill and the diversity of science and society: An introduction to the Third International Symposium on Krill	JOURNAL OF CRUSTACEAN BIOLOGY												Krill (class Malacostraca, order Euphausiacea) play important ecological roles in all of the world's oceans, and some species (e.g., Euphausia pacifica Hansen, 1911 and E. superba Dana, 1850) are fished commercially. The Third International Symposium on Krill was convened in June 2017 to provide an opportunity for face-to-face discussions of the latest global developments in krill research. Seventy-five delegates from 13 countries participated. Presentations were grouped into six sessions: 1) Group living: biology and behaviour; 2) Ecosystems: why are krill so successful?; 3) Myths and legends: links to ice, depth distribution, and population trajectories; 4) New approaches to bust the myths: technology and a look to the future; 5) Krill in winter; and 6) What can we scientists learn from krill fisheries? The final session was followed by an industry-sponsored workshop on krill fishing that was intended to provide an opportunity for dialogue between fishers and researchers. It is apparent that although many advances have been made in understanding the biology and ecology of krill in recent years, several fundamental questions remain (for example, 'how long do krill live?'). In recognition of this, and in an attempt to maintain momentum in krill research, Symposium participants proposed a new Working Group on krill to the Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research (SCAR), and the SCAR Krill Action Group (SKAG) was adopted in June 2018.																	0278-0372	1937-240X				NOV	2018	38	6					651	655		10.1093/jcbiol/ruy075							WOS:000456691100001

In order to study the effect of stress on solitary living we tethered krill to wooden skewers and measured heart rate both when they were held isolated from conspecifics and when they were held at normal schooling distances (similar to1 body length). Heart rate did not differ significantly with sex or body size. However, intermoult krill had a significantly lower heart rate than postmoult animals. When two individuals were held at schooling distance, with one slightly higher in the water column than the other, the heart rate of the higher individual slowed significantly (106-98 beats min(-1)), while that of the lower individual remained the same. We interpret these results to mean that krill living solitarily are stressed but will respond to neighbouring individuals by decreasing their metabolic rate and saving energy.

J	Plaganyi, EE; Butterworth, DS				Plaganyi, Eva E.; Butterworth, Doug S.			The Scotia Sea krill fishery and its possible impacts on dependent predators: modeling localized depletion of prey	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS												The nature and impact of fishing on predators that share a fished resource is an important consideration in ecosystem-based fisheries management. Krill (Euphausia superba) is a keystone species in the Antarctic, serving as a fundamental forage source for predators and simultaneously being subject to fishing. We developed a spatial multispecies operating model (SMOM) of krill-predator fishery dynamics to help advise on allocation of the total krill catch among 15 small-scale management units (SSMUs) in the Scotia Sea, with a goal to reduce the potential impact of fishing on krill predators. The operating model describes the underlying population dynamics and is used in simulations to compare different management options for adjusting fishing activities (e.g., a different spatial distribution of catches). The numerous uncertainties regarding the choice of parameter values pose a major impediment to constructing reliable ecosystem models. The pragmatic solution proposed here involves the use of operating models that are composed of alternative combinations of parameters that essentially try to bound the uncertainty in, for example, the choice of survival rate estimates as well as the functional relationships between predators and prey. Despite the large uncertainties, it is possible to discriminate the ecosystem impacts of different spatial fishing allocations. The spatial structure of the model is fundamental to addressing concerns of localized depletion of prey in the vicinity of land-based predator breeding colonies. Results of the model have been considered in recent management deliberations for spatial allocations of krill catches in the Scotia Sea and their associated impacts on dependent predator species.

Both species are typically boreal and subarctic, and were found in very low abundances in the Arctic water masses in the northern Barents Sea. High abundances (up to 100 to 200 ind. m(-2)) of T, inermis and T. longicaudata were found in the slope and adjoining deep waters south and south east of the Svalbard Bank. The main spawning times of T. inermis and T. longicaudata occurred in May-June and coincided with the spring phytoplankton bloom. T, inermis has a life span of 3 to 4 yr, while T. longicaudata can live up to 2 yr. Growth took place from late winter to autumn; a marked negative growth occurred during the late autumn and winter periods. The seasonally oscillating von Bertalanffy growth function gave a reasonably good fit to the growth curves. Coinciding with a strong reduction in the older capelin stock between 1984 and 1987, there was a subsequent increase in the abundance and biomass of T. inermis and T. longicaudata. A decrease in krill abundance and biomass was observed to correspond with the rapid recovery and growth of capelin stock up to 1991. This indicates a clear predator-prey interrelationship between planktivorous capelin and krill in the Barents Sea and suggests that the krill populations are to a large extent controlled by predation.																	0171-8630					DEC	1996	144	1-3					175	183		10.3354/meps144175							WOS:A1996WB52100015

Antarctic krill fishery effects over penguin populations under adverse climate conditions: Implications for the management of fishing practices	AMBIO												Fast climate changes in the western Antarctic Peninsula are reducing krill density, which along with increased fishing activities in recent decades, may have had synergistic effects on penguin populations. We tested that assumption by crossing data on fishing activities and Southern Annular Mode (an indicator of climate change in Antarctica) with penguin population data. Increases in fishing catch during the non-breeding period were likely to result in impacts on both chinstrap (Pygoscelis antarcticus) and gentoo (P. papua) populations. Catches and climate change together elevated the probability of negative population growth rates: very high fishing catch on years with warm winters and low sea ice (associated with negative Southern Annular Mode values) implied a decrease in population size in the following year. The current management of krill fishery in the Southern Ocean takes into account an arbitrary and fixed catch limit that does not reflect the variability of the krill population under effects of climate change, therefore affecting penguin populations when the environmental conditions were not favorable.

Ocean acidification, caused by sequestration of carbon dioxide into ocean surface waters (pCO(2)), alters the lipid biochemistry of some organisms. This can have cascading effects up the food chain. In a year-long laboratory experiment adult krill were exposed to ambient seawater pCO(2) levels (400 mu atm), elevated pCO(2) levels mimicking near-future ocean acidification (1000, 1500 and 2000 mu atm) and an extreme pCO(3) level (4000 mu atm). Total lipid mass (mg g(-1) DM) of krill was unaffected by near-future pCO(2). Fatty acid composition (%) and fatty acid ratios associated with immune responses and cell membrane fluidity were also unaffected by near-future pCO(2), apart from an increase in 18:3n-3/18:2n-6 ratios in krill in 1500 mu atm pCO(2) in winter and spring. Extreme pCO(2) had no effect on krill lipid biochemistry during summer. During winter and spring, krill in extreme pCO(2) had elevated levels of 18:2n-6 (up to 1.2% increase), 20:4n-6 (up to 0.8% increase), lower 18:3n-3/18:2n-6 and 20:5n-3/20:4n-6 ratios, and showed evidence of increased membrane fluidity (up to three-fold increase in phospholipid/sterol ratios). These results indicate that the lipid biochemistry of adult krill is robust to near-future ocean acidification.

Krill larvae, copepods and the microbial food web: interactions during the Antarctic fall	AQUATIC MICROBIAL ECOLOGY												Experiments were run in the Antarctic Bellinghausen Sea during the austral fall to ascertain the interactive effects of krill larvae (furcilia) and copepods on the microbial food web. A cross-classified design with addition of the small cyclopoid copepod Oithona similis and either the furcilia larvae of Euphausia superba or the calanoid copepod Metridia gerlachei to the natural planktonic community was used, as well as a single experiment with varying densities of O. similis. The experiments showed furcilia to have much higher grazing rates on copepods and ciliates than on algae, with positive selection for ciliates that was not influenced by the presence or absence of O. similis. M gerlachei had a grazing impact on ciliates that was much less than that of furcilia larvae, but due to a high taxonomic resolution of the ciliate community it could be shown that there were groups of grazing-vulnerable and -resistant forms. Contrary to expectations, O. similis had very low grazing rates on both ciliates and algae, but here too grazing-vulnerable and -resistant groups of ciliates could be distinguished. Neither the very strong impact of furcilia on ciliates, copepods and algae nor the more moderate impact of M gerlachei cascaded down to heterotrophic and phototrophic nanoplankton or to bacteria. At least at the time of our experiments, ciliates were tightly bound to the 'classic' aquatic food web, but do not serve to transmit atrophic cascade from the classic and microbial food webs.																	0948-3055					JAN 19	2007	46	1					1	13		10.3354/ame046001							WOS:000244194200001						
J	Watanabe, YY; Ito, M; Takahashi, A				Watanabe, Yuuki Y.; Ito, Motohiro; Takahashi, Akinori			Testing optimal foraging theory in a penguin-krill system	PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES												Food is heterogeneously distributed in nature, and understanding how animals search for and exploit food patches is a fundamental challenge in ecology. The classic marginal value theorem (MVT) formulates optimal patch residence time in response to patch quality. The MVT was generally proved in controlled animal experiments; however, owing to the technical difficulties in recording foraging behaviour in the wild, it has been inadequately examined in natural predator-prey systems, especially those in the three-dimensional marine environment. Using animal-borne accelerometers and video cameras, we collected a rare dataset in which the behaviour of a marine predator (penguin) was recorded simultaneously with the capture timings of mobile, patchily distributed prey (krill). We provide qualitative support for the MVT by showing that (i) krill capture rate diminished with time in each dive, as assumed in the MVT, and (ii) dive duration (or patch residence time, controlled for dive depth) increased with short-term, dive-scale krill capture rate, but decreased with long-term, bout-scale krill capture rate, as predicted from the MVT. Our results demonstrate that a single environmental factor (i.e. patch quality) can have opposite effects on animal behaviour depending on the time scale, emphasizing the importance of multi-scale approaches in understanding complex foraging strategies.

Assessing the recovery of an Antarctic predator from historical exploitation	ROYAL SOCIETY OPEN SCIENCE												The recovery of whale populations from centuries of exploitation will have important management and ecological implications due to greater exposure to anthropogenic activities and increasing prey consumption. Here, a Bayesian population model integrates catch data, estimates of abundance, and information on genetics and biology to assess the recovery of western South Atlantic (WSA) humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae). Modelling scenarios evaluated the sensitivity of model outputs resulting from the use of different data, different model assumptions and uncertainty in catch allocation and in accounting for whales killed but not landed. A long period of exploitation drove WSA humpback whales to the brink of extinction. They declined from nearly 27 000 (95% PI = 22 800-33 000) individuals in 1830 to only 450 (95% PI = 200-1400) whales in the mid-1950s. Protection led to a strong recovery and the current population is estimated to be at 93% (95% PI = 73-100%) of its pre-exploitation size. The recovery of WSA humpback whales may result in large removals of their primary prey, the Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba), and has the potential to modify the community structure in their feeding grounds. Continued monitoring is needed to understand how these whales will respond to modern threats and to climate-driven changes to their habitats.

J	Virtue, P; Nichols, PD; Nicol, S; Hosie, G				Virtue, P; Nichols, PD; Nicol, S; Hosie, G			Reproductive trade off in male Antarctic krill, Euphausia superba	MARINE BIOLOGY												Freshly caught male and female Euphausia superba from the same swarm exhibited different rates of mortality subsequent to capture. Mortality was significantly higher for reproductive males (100%, n = 68) than for females (3%, n = 186) within the first 3 d of capture. Total lipid and triacylglycerol levels in male, female and juvenile Euphausia superba were analysed and compared. All reproductive male krill analysed from this swarm had low lipid levels (1 to 3% dry weight) with negligible triacylglycerol stores (0 to 2% of total lipid). Somatic lipid stores in female and juvenile krill ranged from 8 to 30%, of which up to 40% was triacylglycerol. The levels of algal sterols in the digestive gland of males, females and juveniles indicate that all krill had been feeding recently. An analysis of the sex ratio of krill catches derived from data collected over seven summers from the Prydz Bay region showed a decrease in the proportion of males with increasing size. There was a sharp decline in numbers of male krill once they attained a length of 51 to 55 mm. Low lipid levels in redroductive male krill may be due to reproductive costs. The resulting low storage-lipid levels are accompanied by high mortality in male krill.

Spatial distributions of two species of krill (ice and Antarctic krill) were estimated by GAMs. Three abiotic factors distance from the continental shelf break (800m isobaths), the mean temperature and salinity from the surface to 200m (MTEM-200 and MSAL-200), and latitude and longitude were used as covariates for models of krill. Estimated spatial distributions of krill were then used with other covariates to model the spatial distribution of Antarctic minke whales. In the selected model of Antarctic minke whales, Antarctic krill were more influential than ice krill. The number of Antarctic minke whales increased as the density of Antarctic krill increased to around 1.5gm2. Beyond that, the number of Antarctic minke whales decreased as the density of Antarctic krill increased. High densities of the Antarctic minke whales were estimated along the sea ice edge in the eastern part of the Ross Sea. Specifically, the densities were high in the north of the continental shelf break where low MTEM-200 and MSAL-200 and intermediate densities of Antarctic krill were observed. Further data collection is needed to investigate interannual variations and trends in their relationship. The results show that the spatial distribution of Antarctic minke whales is a function of longitude, distance from the shelf break, oceanographic condition (temperature and salinity), and densities of ice and Antarctic krill.

PP-AKP was supplemented to ovariectomized Sprague Dawley rats for 90 days. The results showed that PP-AKP treatment remarkably prevented the reduction of bone mass and improved cancellous bone structure and biochemical properties. PP-AKP also significantly decreased serum contents of tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRACP), cathepsin K (Cath-k), matrix metalloproteinases-9 (MMP-9), deoxypyridinoline (DPD), C-terminal telopeptide of collagen I (CTX-1), Ca, and P. Mechanism investigation revealed that PP-AKP significantly increased the osteoprotegerin (OPG)/receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa B ligand (RANKL) ratio in mRNA expression, protein expression, and serum content. Further research suggested that NF-kappa B signaling pathways were inhibited by suppressing the mRNA and protein expressions of nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NFATc1) and tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6), diminishing the mRNA expression and phosphorylation of nuclear factor kappa B p65 (NF-kappa B p65), three key transcription factors in NF-kappa B pathways. These results suggest that PP-AKP can improve osteoporosis by inhibiting bone resorption via suppressing the activation of osteodastogenesis related NF-kappa B pathways.

Starvation increased the intermolt period in krill, but had no effect on the fluoride concentration of the molts produced. Addition of excess fluoride to the sea water had no direct effect on the intermolt period, the molt weight, or molt size. Additions of 6-mu-g 1(-1) and 10-mu-g 1(-1) fluoride raised the fluoride concentrations of the molts produced and of the whole animals. The whole body fluoride content varied cyclically during the molt cycle, reaching a peak 6 days following ecdysis. Fluoride loss at ecdysis could largely be explained by the amount of this ion shed in the molt.																	0278-0372					FEB	1991	11	1					10	16		10.2307/1548539							WOS:A1991EX28900002

Metachronal swimming in Antarctic krill: gait kinematics and system design	MARINE BIOLOGY												Metachronal swimming, in which adjacent appendages stroke in sequence, is widespread among crustaceans inhabiting the transitional flow realm in which both viscosity and inertia effects are important. However, the design and operation of this propulsion system in response to various hydrodynamic, energetic, and behavioral needs have not been well investigated. We examine free-swimming Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) as a model species and identify three distinct behavioral swimming gaits. The pleopod kinematics of these gaits, hovering, fast-forward swimming, and upside-down swimming, are quantified via image analysis of high-speed video. Pleopod stroke amplitude and frequency were found to vary significantly among these swimming modes. In order to increase swimming speed, krill were found first to increase stroke amplitude and secondarily to increase beat frequency. The kinematics of these distinct swimming modes provide insight as we consider multi-appendage metachronal swimming from a design standpoint. The ratio of the distance between adjacent appendage bases and appendage length is identified as a key parameter in metachrony, the value of which is constrained to a narrow range for a wide variety of species.

J	Cornejo-Donoso, J; Antezana, T				Cornejo-Donoso, Jorge; Antezana, Tarsicio			Preliminary trophic model of the Antarctic Peninsula Ecosystem (Sub-area CCAMLR 48.1)	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING												Species, biomasses, production rates, distribution and other aspects of the community structure have been studied in the Antarctic Ecosystem; however there are no integrated models that explain mass transfer at the spatial mesoscale. Even though the Antarctic Ecosystem as a whole has been identified as a functional unit, subsystems could be identified and characterized, among which, the Antarctic Peninsula stands out for its particular geography, oceanography and trophic web. The aim of this work is to construct a mass balanced model describing the main trophic interactions of this community. The model is built using the software Ecopath with Ecosim 5.0, which yields a representation of the trophic web and estimations of global ecosystem properties. Phytoplankton, zooplankton and krill accounted for most of the mass flow. Flows to the trophic level II (TL II; detritivores and herbivores) were attributed to zooplanktonic and benthic organisms mainly Flows to the TL III were explained by fish, birds (flying birds and penguins), Balaenoptera acutorostrata and baleen whales. Flows to the TL IV were dominated by some fish, birds (flyingbirds and penguins) and mammals. Finally, in TL VI, the flows were dominated by Orcinus orca. O. orca was the top predator in the ecosystem with a TL of 4.88, followed by Physeter catodon (4.63) and Hydrurga leptonyx (4.62). Krill was found at the intermediate TL (2.33). Resulting ecosystem indexes (e.g. total transfer efficiency, connectance index, etc.) were consistent and characteristic of ecosystems of high temporal and spatial variability. The model gives a comprehensive description of the food web dominated by phytoplankton-krill-top predators chain, and complemented with alternative food pathways (e.g. through Electrona antarctica), which together gives an enhanced complexity to the system. Despite the limitations of the model in data gaps, particularly for winter season, grouping of functional groups, steady state assumptions, etc., it improves the description of the trophic structure and ecosystem functioning of the Antarctic Peninsula and highlights gaps in knowledge.

Main prey items were krill Euphausia superba, the amphipod hyperiid Themisto gaudichaudii, mysids (primarily Antarctomysis maxima), and in 1985 also Thysanoessa species. The proportion of krill and T gaudichaudii in the diet varied considerably among the 3 years, whereas the proportion of mysids in the diet remained fairly constant, Krill appears to be the preferred food. In years of krill shortage, such as in 1991, krill was replaced by T gaudichaudii. The occurrence of krill in the diet in 1991 was among the lowest within a 28 yr period of investigation. Variation in food composition among sampling sites was high. This high variation appears to be primarily associated with differences in prey availability, but much less with prey size selectivity. Feeding intensity varied considerably among seasons. It was highest in 1992. The proportion of empty stomachs was uncommonly high and stomach content weight was uncommonly low in January 1991, a period when energy-rich food was needed for the final maturation of gonads. At the same time, an unusually high proportion of sexually mature fish showed no signs of the gonad development necessary for spawning in that season. It was hypothesized that as in some other non-Antarctic fish species the shortage of suitable food may have forced the fish to sacrifice gonad maturation in order to maintain body size.																	0171-8630					MAY	1994	108	1-2					43	57		10.3354/meps108043							WOS:A1994NN70000005						
J	Teschke, M; Kawaguchi, S; Meyer, B				Teschke, Mathias; Kawaguchi, So; Meyer, Bettina			Effects of simulated light regimes on maturity and body composition of Antarctic krill, Euphausia superba	MARINE BIOLOGY												The effect of different light regimes on the development of sexual maturity and body composition (carbon, nitrogen, lipid and protein) of Antarctic krill, Euphausia superba, was studied over 12 weeks under laboratory conditions. Krill were exposed to light-cycle regimes of variable intensity to simulate Southern Ocean summer, autumn and winter conditions, respectively using: (1) continuous light (LL; 200 lux max), (2) 12-h light and 12-h darkness (LD 12:12; 50 lux max), and (3) continuous darkness (DD). The sexual maturity of female and male krill exposed to LL and LD 12:12 showed an accelerated succession of external maturity stages during the experimental period, while krill exposed to continuous darkness showed no changes in external maturity during the course of the study. Changes in the maturity development of krill between the different light regimes are reflected in changes in body composition. Krill exposed to LL and LD 12:12 showed an increase in lipid utilization, indicating that the development of external maturation may be fuelled preferentially by lipid reserves. In contrast, values of total lipid content of krill held under continuous darkness indicated an unchanged lipid catabolism during the course of the study. Thus, the maturity development of krill was affected either directly or indirectly by the different simulated light conditions. Based on these results, and observations on the effects of simulated light regimes on feeding and metabolic rates of krill available from a previous study, we suggest that the Antarctic light regime is an essential cue governing the seasonal cycle of krill physiology and maturity, and highlight the importance of this environmental factor in the life history of krill.

The sodium salt was added to the SA/AKP solution to adjust the ionization degree and intermolecular interaction of composite system. The main purpose of this study is to investigate the influences of sodium salt types (NaCl, CH3COONa, Na2SO4) on the intermolecular interaction of SA/AKP composite fibers. The intermolecular interaction, morphology, crystallinity, thermal stability and mechanical properties of SA/AKP composite fibers were analyzed by fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), scanning electron microscope (SEM), x-ray diffraction (XRD), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The results show that the types of sodium salt have obvious influences on the content of both beta-sheet, intermolecular hydrogen bond, breaking strength and surface morphology in SA/AKP composite fibers, but have a negligible effect on the crystallinity and thermal stability.					zhang, rui/0000-0001-7496-6041												0144-8617	1879-1344				JUN 1	2018	189						72	78		10.1016/j.carbpol.2018.02.013							WOS:000428322000010	29580428

Four diets containing 0% (S0 group), 10% (S10 group), 20% (S20 group), and 30% (S20 group) FDPE were used in the present study. At the end of growth trial, the final body weight, weight gain rate, and specific growth rate in the S10, S20, and S30 groups were higher than those in the S0 group. The shrimp in the S10 and S20 groups exhibited better molting synchronism than those in the S0 group. The astaxanthin content in the hepatopancreas from the shrimp in the groups supplemented with FDPE was significantly higher than that in the S0 group (p < 0.05) and increased as the FDPE content in the feed increased. The shrimp in the S10, S20, and S30 groups had a higher monounsaturated fatty acid (MUFA) content in the hepatopancreas than those in the S0 group. The sum of EPA and DHA in the muscles from the shrimp in the S0 group was lower than that in the other groups. These results indicate that the dietary inclusion of 10%-20% FDPE can be used as practical diets in L. vannamei farmed under a clear water system.

Comparisons of grazing on Phaeocystis antarctica (Karsten) and Thalassiosira antarctica (Comber)	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY												Diatoms and prymnesiophytes are major constituents of spring phytoplankton blooms in the Antarctic. While diatoms are known to be well grazed by krill, the role of prymnesiophytes in the krill's diet is unknown. Clearance and ingestion rates of Euphausia superba grazing on three size classes of Phaeocystis antarctica were compared to rates on the diatom Thalassiosira antarctica in parallel, unialgal experiments. Clearance rates were calculated from disappearance of chlorophyll a during grazing, and converted to carbon and nitrogen ingestion rates based on elemental (CHN) analysis of phytoplankton cultures, Clearance and ingestion rates of krill on small R antaretica colonies (50-100 mum) were similar to rates on T. antarctica, whereas rates on medium P. antaretica colonies (100-500 mum) and single cell P. antarctica were significantly lower than for T antarctica. Overall, clearance rates on P antarctica decreased with increasing colony size. Clearance rates on T antarctica were variable, and correlated with degree of chain fort-nation. These results suggest that E. superba effectively grazes small colonies of P. antarctica, but not larger colonies or single cells.

However, many of the length classes of krill can escape through commonly used commercial trawl mesh sizes. A vital component of the overall management of a fishery is to estimate the total fishing mortalityand quantify the mortality rate of individuals that escape from fishing gear. The methods for determining fishing mortality in krill are still poorly developed. We used a covered codend sampling technique followed by onboard observations made in holding tanks to monitor mortality rates of escaped krill. Haul duration, hydrological conditions, maximum fishing depth and catch composition all had no significant effect on mortality of krill escaping 16 mm mesh size nets, nor was any further mortality associated with the holding tank conditions. A non-parametric Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to model the relationship between mortality rates of escapees and time. There was a weak tendency, though not significant, for smaller individuals to suffer higher mortality than larger individuals. The mortality of krill escaping the trawl nets in our study was 4.4 +/- 4.4%, suggesting that krill are fairly tolerant of the capture-and-escape process in trawls.

Throughout the survey, multi-frequency echosounder data and ancillary environmental data were collected to determine the distribution and abundance of Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) and to explore its broad relationship with the bio-physical environment. The acoustic data were analysed using three different methods to provide measurements of krill abundance that can be set in context with previous studies. Based on the most recently developed acoustic method, the mean biomass-density of krill across the survey area (1.3 million km(2)) was estimated to be 24 g m(-2). Total biomass was estimated to be 28.75 million tonnes (Mt) with a coefficient of variation (CV) of 16.18%. This biomass estimate has been used by the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR) to update the precautionary catch limit for krill in this area (CCAMLR Division 58.4.2) from 0.450 to 2.645 Mt. Overall, krill were widely distributed at relatively low densities: 25% of the 2-km along-track echo-integration intervals were devoid of krill, 50% registered densities of 1 g m(-2) of krill or less and 75% registered densities of 12 g m(-2) or less. Mean densities were highest in the waters to the south of the Southern Boundary (SB) of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC), while the waters to the north of the Southern ACC Front (SACCF) were almost devoid of krill. Half of the cumulative krill density across the survey was found within 80 km of the 1000 m isobath (the shelf break), and 40% within 40 km. This was mostly due to particularly high densities (up to 4400 g m(-2)) around the shelf break on 3 of the 11 transects surveyed. The majority of acoustic krill detections were in the top 100 m of the water column, centred around 50 m depth.

J	Wallis, JR; Smith, AJR; Kawaguchi, S				Wallis, Jake R.; Smith, Abigail J. R.; Kawaguchi, So			Discovery of gregarine parasitism in some Southern Ocean krill (Euphausiacea) and the salp Salpa thompsoni	POLAR BIOLOGY												The presence and role of endoparasites in pelagic macrozooplankton within the Southern Ocean are poorly understood. Accounts of such parasites are generally restricted to the Antarctic krill species Euphausia superba, with little information on other possible host species. Endoparasitic gregarines were recorded for the first time in the euphausiids Euphausia triacantha and Euphausia valentini and the salp Salpa thompsoni during the Kerguelen Axis Antarctic research cruise (February-March 2016). Gregarines found in E. triacantha and E. valentini were morphologically similar to those previously identified in Antarctic krill, E. superba. Despite overlapping distributions, the smaller euphausiid Thysanoessa macrura possessed a different gregarine endoparasite, indicating parasite-host specificity in Southern Ocean euphausiids. Most notable was the discovery of large gregarines in the stomachs of aggregate individuals of S. thompsoni. The presence of gregarines in these dominant macrozooplankton indicates that endoparasitism within the Southern Ocean is more common than previously thought. Gregarines were observed in guts of krill and salps collected between 57.9 and 63.6A degrees S. The continual presence of gregarines in the species examined indicates that these host-parasite interactions are not isolated events with differing life stages of gregarines within the same intestinal tract of some species indicating periodic infection. The impacts of gregarine parasitism on these newly identified hosts are unclear and require further investigation to understand the spatial and temporal patterns of gregarine-host interactions.

Individual krill respond to a changing landscape of predation risk and food availability by migrating vertically in the column and choosing an average distance to their nearest neighbor (swarm density). We determine the optimal behavior of 30, 40 and 50 mm krill using a state-dependent life history model where individuals move along 30-day segments of hypothetical journey tracks in three different regions of the Scotia Sea, with the tracks extracted from a combination of circulation models and surface drifter data. Food availability is based on satellite data for surface Chl and with additional heterotrophic and detritus food components, and mortality is parameterized with respect to distance from shore, daylight and krill swarming-behavior. We predict that proximity to predator colonies has a distinct effect on behavior, particularly on depth choice when food-availability is low. Observations made during an acoustic survey of the region found swarms to be deeper at the Antarctic Peninsula compared with South Georgia, in line with model pedictions. Our pedictions are also consistent with observations that swarm density, changes little on a logarithmic scale across the region. We show that being able to change behavior on short time scales has distinct advantages to krill.

A chromatographic protocol was developed that allowed complete separation of the two enzyme forms, named NAGase B and NAGase C. The latter was purified to homogeneity with 600-fold enrichment and a yield of 17%. The molecular mass was 150 kDa. NAGase B showed characteristics of a glycoprotein due to affinity towards concanavalin A sepharose, while NAGase C did not. Highly specific polyclonal antibodies to NAGase C [anti-(E. superba-NAGase C)-IgG] showed only negligible cross-reactivity with NAGase B isoforms. A comparison with the Northern krill, Meganyctiphanes norvegica,revealed a corresponding chromatographic pattern with two main activity peaks, for differentiation named NAGase II and NAGase III. Application of the antibody on M. norvegica revealed a high specificity toward NAGase III and a low cross-reactivity with NAGase II. First indication is given that the two forms are no isoenzymes in a strict sense but instead may have different functions in the metabolism of krill. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Inc.

LFK was prepared by removing exoskeletons from dried whole krill to give a fluoride content of approximately one-fourth of krill meal (KM) at 230 ppm for LFK and 870 ppm for KM. Experimental diets replaced FM with LFK at the replacement proportions of 0.0%, 7.7%, 15.4%, 30.8%, 46.2% and 100.0% (control, LFK7, LFK15, LFK30, LFK46 and LFK100) and were fed to groups of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) in duplicate for 95 days in fresh water and growth was observed. In all experimental groups, feed intake, feed efficiency, specific growth rate and hepatosomatic index were unchanged compared with fish fed the control diet (P<0.05). After 95 days, the fluoride concentration in dorsal muscles of the fish of each experimental group, except LFK100, was below the detectable limit (1 mg/kg), and in vertebral bones it was between 220 mg/kg and 420 mg/kg. However, the dorsal muscle and the vertebral bone of LFK100 contained 1 mg/kg and 1800 mg/kg of fluoride, respectively. Tissue specimens of the liver of each experimental group at 95 days had no histopathological changes. The total replacement of FM from LFK in diets was successful with no defects of growth performances. This study showed that krill protein had a nutritional value equivalent to FM.

The eyestalks from 51 individuals were dissected, cut in longitudinal sections and studied for identifying growth zones. The krill was collected at the South Orkney Islands during January and February 2015, and varied between 30 and 53 mm in total body length. Up to six growth zones were identified, each zone consisting of one light and one dark section. The width of the longitudinal sections increased with increasing body length, although there were differences between sexes. Females tended to have narrower growth zones from the third zone and onwards compared with males. Data show that male subadult stages (MIIA1, MIIA2 and MIIA3) had 2.2 +/- 0.8 (average +/- SD) zones and adult male stages had 3.8 +/- 0.8 zones. The female juvenile stage (FHB) had 1.7 +/- 0.5 zones and adult females (FIIIA-E) had 3.7 +/- 1.0 zones. There were positive relationships between the number of zones and the maturity stage, and between the number of zones and body length. Further knowledge about molting process in the Antarctic krill and a verification of the ageing procedure from krill with a known age is needed before the number of growth zones can be definitely established as an indicator of age. The detection of growth zones in the Antarctic krill will be an important contribution to the understanding of the biology of the species if the zones actually represent annual growth.																	0278-0372	1937-240X				MAY	2016	36	3					267	273		10.1163/1937240X-00002428							WOS:000376055900001

In this study, we investigate the impact of this light- and temperature dependent metabolic regulation on growth, reproduction and winter survival of krill. Therefore, we advance a bioenergetic growth model of krill by adding a data-derived scaling function of krill activity. With SERBIK (SEasonally Regulated BIoenergetic Krill growth model), we conduct a numerical experiment which tests the impact of such scaling on krill life history under two different winter food conditions: In the first scenario, we simulate life history of krill when winter food availability is low; in the second scenario, winter food availability is increased within realistic ranges. The results demonstrate that the scaling of metabolism is especially important during low food winters. Reducing metabolism during winter permits individuals to grow to larger body length, reproduce successfully and release a greater number of eggs. It further significantly reduces within-year size fluctuations caused by starvation during months with low food availability. Finally, SERBIK can be used in future spatial modelling studies which include movement of krill along latitudinal gradients and thus spatiotemporal gradients in light- and temperature.

Implications in Energetics and carbon balances	JOURNAL OF MARINE SYSTEMS												Samples of Antarctic krill were analyzed for elemental composition, biochemical composition, weight and caloric content. Sexes and maturity stages were separated. Mature females showed the highest caloric values (joules) and juveniles the lowest in a per animal basis. On unit of wet weight per animal basis, spent females showed the lowest caloric values. For the caloric values by animal, a significant difference was found between males, mature females, spent females and juveniles, either on a per animal basis or in the basis of 1 g of wet weight, showing a real difference between the groups, regardless of their individual size. Significant differences were found for carbon, nitrogen and lipids, but not for proteins, analyzed in % of dry weight. Carbon was lowest for spent females and highest for mature females. On the contrary, nitrogen values were lowest for mature females and highest for males. Mature females had the highest lipid content and males the lowest. All variables were significantly correlated. For the linear regression analysis, the best correlation found was between joules and carbon, followed by carbon vs. dry weight and joules vs. dry weight. In an analysis with two independent variables, the best correlation was found for joules vs. lipids and dry weight, followed by joules vs. carbon and nitrogen, and joules vs. lipids and proteins. The results obtained were used to make an analysis of the energy and carbon fluxes through the food chain in the sampled area, showing higher energetic and carbon "densities" in frontal areas, the POM calorific values showed an opposite pattern than that of krill.

Standard Rectangular Midwater Trawl net tows were carried out at midnight and midday stations between 20degrees and 70degreesW south of the Polar Front. The overall mean numerical density and biomass of krill estimated from nets (247 krill per 1000 m(3) and 18.7 g m(-2), respectively) were similar to lower values reported previously for the Southwest Atlantic, and comparable with high values for other regions of the Southern Ocean. Krill varied in mean size across the survey area, with cluster analyses showing three distinct groups of length-frequency distribution. Small juvenile and immature krill occurred east of the South Orkney Islands. Adult krill < 50 mm dominated the shelf areas of the Antarctic Peninsula and to the north of the juvenile stock across the Scotia Sea. Adult krill > 50 mm were mostly restricted to the west of the South Orkney Islands. Maturity stage composition indicated that peak spawning occurred before early February. Distribution of the spawning stock showed two hotspots, the first between the South Shetland and South Orkney Islands, and the second around the South Sandwich Islands. Reproductive krill were largely absent in the central Scotia Sea and around South Georgia. Krill larvae concentrations occurred slightly to the east of the spawning stock. Mean density of larvae in the western Scotia Sea was 2044 m(-2), but only scattered aggregations of larvae were recorded east of 36degreesW (2 m(-2)). Recruitment indices for 1- and 2-year-old krill were low in the western part of the survey area, the outflow from the Bellingshausen Sea/Antarctic Peninsula region (R-1 = 0.0, R-2 = 0.11) indicating spawning failure and/or poor recruitment for several years. In the eastern part of the survey area, mostly the outflow of the Weddell Sea, recruitment indices were high and above the long-term average (R-1 = 0.60, R-2 = 0.72), suggesting a population with constant and successful reproduction, recruitment and mortality. The distribution and structure of the krill population did not show any clear relationship to the position of the major oceanic fronts in the Scotia Sea. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

The particle image velocimetry (PIV) technique was used to measure the velocity field in vertical planes aligned with the krill body axis. The krill generates a narrow jet-like flow behind and below the pleopods (roughly 25degrees below horizontal). The volume of fluid moving at greater than 10% of the maximum velocity near the pleopods is roughly 18 times larger than the volume of the krill. Thus, the hydrodynamic disturbance occupies a significantly larger region than the animal body. Other krill, sensing the flow disturbance, may take advantage of the flow induced by a neighbor to locate a mate or to draft for efficient propulsion.

E. superba shows daily and seasonal rhythms in physiology and behaviour, which are synchronized with the environmental cycles of its habitat. Recently, the main components of the krill circadian machinery have been identified and characterized. However, the exact mechanisms through which the endogenous timing system operates the control and regulation of the overt rhythms remains only partially understood. Here we investigate the involvement of the circadian clock in the temporal orchestration of gene expression by using a newly developed version of a krill microarray platform. The analysis of transcriptome data from krill exposed to both light-dark cycles (LD 18:6) and constant darkness (DD), has led to the identification of 1,564 putative clock-controlled genes. A remarkably large proportion of such genes, including several clock components (clock, period, cry2, vrille, and slimb), show oscillatory expression patterns in DD, with a periodicity shorter than 24 hours. Energy-storage pathways appear to be regulated by the endogenous clock in accordance with their ecological relevance in daily energy managing and overwintering. Our results provide the first representation of the krill circadian transcriptome under laboratory, free-running conditions.

Results showed that PP-AKP significantly improved bone turnover status, reduced bone loss and degeneration of microarchitecture, in addition to accelerated bone formation. Further mechanism investigation revealed that PP-AKP suppressed the mRNA expression of MKP-1 and CB1, which activated the downstream osteogenesis-related MAPKs and PI3K/AKT/GSK-3 beta signaling pathways through elevation of the expression of the key factors p38, ERK, PI3K, AKT and beta-catenin, in addition to osteogenic nuclear transcription factors Runx2 and OSX. Additionally, reduction in number of adipocytes and an increase in trabeculae in the bone marrow cavity, in addition to a decrease in abdominal adipose further verified that PP-AKP augmented bone formation with a comparable reduction in the accumulation of fat. In conclusion, PP-AKP ameliorated osteoporosis via promoting MAPKs and PI3K/AKT/GSK-3 beta pathways related to bone formation in dexamethasone-treated mice.																	1756-4646					AUG	2018	47						447	456		10.1016/j.jff.2018.06.004							WOS:000439019200048						
J	Qi, RR; Guo, J; Liu, YF; Zhang, R; Gan, ZW				Qi, Ranran; Guo, Jing; Liu, Yuanfa; Zhang, Rui; Gan, Ziwen			Effects of salt content on secondary structure of protein in sodium alginate/antarctic krill protein composite system and characterization of fiber properties	DYES AND PIGMENTS												The sodium alginate (SA)/antarctic krill protein (AKP) composite fibers were prepared by wet spinning in 5% (w/w) CaCl2 coagulation bath. In this work, salt regulated protein secondary structure to prepare high performance fiber, and the relative content of secondary structure in the composite system was calculated by fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR). The surface morphology, crystallinity, thermal stability, mechanical properties, thermal conductivity and conductivity of the composite fibers were characterized by scanning electron microscope (SEM), x-ray diffraction (XRD), differential scanning calorimeter (DSC), orientation tester, thermal conductivity meter and resistivity test bench. The results revealed that the salt changed the secondary structure of protein by affecting the intermolecular interaction and cross-linking degree of the SA/AKP composite system. After the fine partitioning of the salt content range, with the NaCl mass fraction of 0.7-1.0%, the controllable range of alpha-helix content, beta-sheet content and random coil content are 8.14-25.15%, 52.58-60.87%, 21.53-30.99% for the SA/AKP composite solution, respectively. And the controllable range of alpha-helix content, beta-sheet content and random coil content are 5.62-10.32%, 50.31-57.69%, 33.71-44.07% for the SA/AKP composite fiber, respectively. With the increase of salt content, the crystallinity showed an increasing-decreasing-increasing trend, the thermal conductivity, mechanical properties and orientation degree exhibited a trend of increase-to-decrease, and the thermal stability changed little. Besides, the conductivity of the composite fibers is affected more by the crystallinity of the material, and the surface morphology is also related to the salt content.					zhang, rui/0000-0001-7496-6041												0143-7208	1873-3743				DEC	2019	171								107686	10.1016/j.dyepig.2019.107686							WOS:000484870700024

Submesoscale distribution of Antarctic krill and its avian and pinniped predators before and after a near gale	MARINE BIOLOGY												We conducted two ship-based surveys of the nearshore ecosystem north of Livingston Island, Antarctica during 2-10 February 2005. Between the two surveys, a low-pressure system (963 mbar) passed through the area providing the opportunity to measure ecosystem parameters before and after a near gale. A ship-based multiple-frequency acoustic-backscatter survey was used to assess the distribution and relative abundance of Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba). Net tows, hydrographic profiles, and meteorological data were collected to measure biological and physical processes that might affect the krill population. During the survey, the distribution and behavior of several krill predators [chinstrap penguins (Pygoscelis antarctica), cape petrels (Daption capense), and Antarctic fur seals (Arctocephalus gazella)] were measured from the vessel by visual observations. The survey encompassed an area of roughly 2,500 km(2), containing two submarine canyons with one to the west and one to the east of Cape Shirreff, which had different abundances of krill and predators. Several aspects of the nearshore ecosystem changed after the near gale including: hydrography of the upper 100 m of the water column, phytoplankton biomass, the abundance and distribution of krill, and the distribution of some krill predators. Differences in these parameters were also measured between the two canyons. These changes in the physical and biological environment during the survey period are quantified and show that the ecosystem exhibited significant changes over relatively short spatial (tens of kilometers) and time (tens of hours) scales.

For a number of definitions of effort and catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE), variables were modelled using linear mixed models in order to obtain time series of predicted intra- and interannual trends of standardised fishery indices. The results strongly suggest that the krill fishery in the South Georgia area is operating at a critical level of krill availability which is just enough to maintain the best factory performance. In this analysis the status of fishing in Subareas 48.1 and 48.2 was not clear. A linear correlation was observed between 'catch per searching time' and 'catch per day' within their lower ranges, suggesting these may have some value as abundance indices. Standardised CPUE for the pelagic areas showed significant correlations with previously published interannual series of acoustic density estimates from scientific surveys. To refine these CPUE indices, it will be necessary to collect more detailed information from fishing vessels. It is also important to undertake the same kind of analysis for fleets from other fishing nations.

In other ways, however, they are strikingly different, including their: age, extent, geological structure, ice stability, and foodweb structure. Both regions contain very rapidly warming areas and climate impacts have been reported, as have dramatic future projections. However, the combined effects of a changing climate on oceanographic processes and foodweb dynamics are likely to influence their future fisheries in very different ways. Differences in the life-history strategies of the key zooplankton species (Antarctic krill in the Southern Ocean and Calanus copepods in the Arctic) will likely affect future productivity of fishery species and fisheries. To explore future scenarios for each region, this paper: (i) considers differing characteristics (including geographic, physical, and biological) that define polar marine ecosystems and reviews known and projected impacts of climate change on key zooplankton species that may impact fished species; (ii) summarizes existing fishery resources; (iii) synthesizes this information to generate future scenarios for fisheries; and (iv) considers the implications for future fisheries management. Published studies suggest that if an increase in open water during summer in Arctic and Subarctic seas results in increased primary and secondary production, biomass may increase for some important commercial fish stocks and new mixes of species may become targeted. In contrast, published studies suggest that in the Southern Ocean the potential for existing species to adapt is mixed and that the potential for the invasion of large and highly productive pelagic finfish species appears low. Thus, future Southern Ocean fisheries may largely be dependent on existing species. It is clear from this review that new management approaches will be needed that account for the changing dynamics in these regions under climate change.

J	Burri, L; Heggen, K; Storsve, AB				Burri, Lena; Heggen, Knut; Storsve, Andreas Berg			Phosphatidylcholine from krill increases plasma choline and its metabolites in dogs	VETERINARY WORLD												Background and Aim: Choline and its metabolites have multiple physiological roles in the body, which are important for muscle function, memory, methylation reactions, and hepatic lipid transport. This study aimed to investigate, if inclusion of phosphatidylcholine (PC) from Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) can increase the concentration of choline and its metabolites in plasma of sled dogs in comparison to a control group. Materials and Methods: Ten adult Alaskan Huskies of both genders were supplemented with PC from 8% dietary krill meal inclusion for 6 weeks, while another ten dogs received no krill meal supplementation. Blood measurements of the two groups were taken at baseline and end of the study and compared for choline and its metabolite concentrations. Results: The choline concentration of the krill meal-supplemented dogs was significantly higher after 6 weeks of krill meal feeding compared to the control group (mean increase =4.53 mu mol/L in the supplemented versus 1.21 mu mol/L in the control group, p=0.014). Furthermore, krill meal-supplemented dogs showed significantly more pronounced increases in betaine (p<0.001), dimethylglycine (p<0.01), trimethylamine-N-oxide (p<0.001), and trimethyllysine (p<0.001) compared to the control group. Significant correlations between changes in choline and changes in its metabolites were observed. Conclusion: The results showed that krill meal supplementation was associated with significantly higher plasma choline concentrations, which correlated with changed concentrations of choline metabolites.

Krill were concentrated within a band under ice between 1 and 13 kilometers south of the ice edge. Within this band, krill densities were fivefold greater than that of open water. The under-ice environment has tong been considered an important habitat for krill, but sampling difficulties have previously prevented direct observations under ice over the scale necessary for robust krill density estimation. Autosub-2 enabled us to make continuous high-resolution measurements of krill density under ice reaching 27 kilometers beyond the ice edge.

Protein from Northern krill (Thysanoessa inermis), Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) and the Arctic amphipod (Themisto libellula) can partially replace fish meal in diets to Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) without affecting product quality	AQUACULTURE NUTRITION												The main objective of the present study was to evaluate the effect of using three different crustacean meals (Tysanoessa inermis, Euphausia superba, Themisto libellula) on product quality of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.). In order to do this, a total of six iso-protein, iso-lipid and iso-carotenoid diets were prepared. Two experimental diet series were prepared. In the first series, a control feed (K0) was compared with diets where 20%, 40% and 60% of the fish meal protein were replaced with protein from Northern krill T. inermis (K20, K40 and K60, respectively). In the second series, control feed (K0) was compared with diets where 40% of the dietary protein was replaced by protein from T. inermis (K40), Antarctic krill E. superba (AK40) and the Arctic amphipod T. libellula (AMP40). The salmon groups were fed the various diets for 160 days and the average weight of the fish increased from 410 g to around 1500 g. Fish given diets containing krill displayed a general better growth compared with the ones given pure fish meal diet. Replacing fish meal protein with protein from the crustacean sources had, in general, only minor effects on the flesh quality measured both by technical and sensory methods. However, some significant effects were noted. Postmortem muscle pH was generally lower (P < 0.05), for K20, K40, AMP40 in fish fed crustacean diets compared with those receiving the control diet. Increasing the replacement level of non-fish meal protein from Northern krill (K20, K60) significantly reduced the rigor contraction. Fish given K20 had a slightly firmer meat texture, measured as resistance to post-rigor compression, especially when compared with K60 (P < 0.05). Fish from the K20 and AMP40 groups had a deeper red flesh coloration [both light reflection (A*-value and chroma) and flesh astaxanthin concentration] than fish fed K0 and higher inclusions of krill meal. The groups with the highest astaxanthin flesh content also showed the best growth and had the highest feed intake. Finally, a sensory panel analysis differed slightly from the technical measurements in that K0, rather than K20 was given the highest score for hardness and colour. In comparison with K0, AK40 got the lowest salty taste and hardness scores from the panellists relative to the control fish (P < 0.05). Despite minor effects on the present quality measures, it is concluded that meal from three different crustacean species can successfully replace fish meal up to 60% with Northern krill, and 40% of Antarctic krill and amphipod meal of dietary proteins.

As for food shortage, because of an increase in the world population, krill is expected to be the last marine resource remained in the world. However, the annual krill catch amounts to only about 80 thousand tons. Many researchers have been studying on the utilization of krill for a long time, but even now the main use of krill is limited to fish feed for aquaculture and bait for leisure fishing. Unfortunately, we can not find any high-value-added krill products in market at present. Considering the low utilization of krill, krill digestive protease was an obstacle for its food processing. Since the protease is highly intensive, it is easy to digest its muscle protein rapidly. Therefore, many researchers have thus tried to inhibit and to remove the protease in order to keep the muscle protein intact. But they have not found effective way keeping the muscle intact. On the other hand, for some medical uses, krill protease is going to play an important part; for example, it would be effective for bedsore remedy and for skin cancer. It would be another way to utilize krill.																	0167-4501		0-08-044450-4				2004	42						45	54									WOS:000223277700004

Spatial variability in total and organic mercury levels in Antarctic krill Euphausia superba across the Scotia Sea	ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION												Total and organic mercury concentrations were determined for males, females and juveniles of Euphausia superba collected at three discrete locations in the Scotia Sea (South Orkney Islands, South Georgia and Antarctic Polar Front) to assess spatial mercury variability in Antarctic krill. There was clear geographic differentiation in mercury concentrations, with specimens from the South Orkney Islands having total mercury concentrations 5 to 7 times higher than Antarctic krill from South Georgia and the Antarctic Polar Front. Mercury did not appear to accumulate with life-stage since juveniles had higher concentrations of total mercury (0.071 mu g g(-1) from South Orkney Islands; 0.014 mu g g(-1) from South Georgia) than adults (0.054 mu g g(-1) in females and 0.048 mu g g(-1) in males from South Orkney Islands; 0.006 mu g g(-1) in females and 0.007 mu g g(-1) in males from South Georgia). Results suggest that females may use egg laying as a mechanism to excrete mercury, with eggs having higher concentrations than the corresponding somatic tissue. Organic mercury makes up a minor percentage of total mercury (15-37%) with the percentage being greater in adults than in juveniles. When compared to euphausiids from other parts of the world, the concentration of mercury in Antarctic krill is within the same range, or higher, highlighting the global distribution of this contaminant. Given the high potential for biomagnification of mercury through food webs, concentrations in Antarctic krill may have deleterious effects on long-lived Antarctic krill predators.

A response surface design was used to obtain the best SDE extraction parameters. The optimum extraction efficiency of 93.77 +/- 0.92% was obtained at a stirring speed of 1030 rpm, temperature of 47 degrees C and dynamic extraction time of 90 min. Compared with n-hexane, ethanol, supercritical CO2 and subcritical n-butane extraction, the krill oil extracted by SDE exhibited low peroxide values (1.46 +/- 0.26 mmol kg(-1)), high astaxanthin (218.06 +/- 4.74 mg kg(-1)), phosphatidylcholine (PC) (33.95 +/- 0.65%), and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) (11.67 +/- 0.23%) content. Moreover, krill oil extracted by SDE has high levels of EPA (16.38 +/- 0.05%) and DHA (7.91 +/- 0.07%). SDE extraction proved to be an efficient and safe method for extraction of quality krill oil from wet Antarctic krill, and it could be a promising method for oil extraction in wet food in future.

Eugregarines were observed to accumulate in the front section of the gut at any host maturity stage. The results of statistical analysis showed that eugregarines at immediately pre-molt stage of the krill decreased significantly in the posterior of the hind-gut, and increased in the anterior of the hind-gut. Thus, the krill's molt stage may be one factor affecting the spatial distribution of eugregarines. As a strategy for avoiding discharge to the outer environment by molting, eugregarines may move to a safety zone (mid-gut).

J	Brierley, AS; Watkins, JL				Brierley, AS; Watkins, JL			Acoustic targets at South Georgia and the South Orkney islands during a season of krill scarcity	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												Dual frequency (38 and 120 kHz) acoustic surveys of shelf-break regions in the vicinity of the Willis Islands, South Georgia, and Coronation Island, South Orkneys, both in the Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean, were carried out from RRS 'James Clark Ross' during January 1994. The difference in echo signal strength between the 2 frequencies [delta MVBS (mean volume backscattering strength) = MVBS 120 kHz - MVBS 38 kHz] was used to partition acoustic targets into 3 biological categories: Antarctic krill Euphausia superba, nekton (larger than krill) and zooplankton (smaller than krill). Krill density estimates were derived for both survey areas, and the relative contribution of each class of target to overall regional pelagic biomass determined. Krill distribution in both regions was extremely patchy, resulting in a highly skewed frequency distribution of density; for example one echo-integration interval contained 10(4) times the mean krill density. An approximate B-fold difference in mean krill abundance was detected between the 2 areas but, in comparison with previously published density estimates, krill densities in both regions were extremely low (1.7 and 10.7 gm(-2) for Willis and Coronation Islands respectively). Gross regional differences in pelagic faunal composition were apparent ent from inspection of echo charts, and were quantified by detailed analysis of acoustic signals. The water column in the vicinity of the Willis Islands was characterised by a series of diffuse but continuous scattering layers visible only at 120 kHz, and 73% by mass of acoustic targets in this region were classified as zooplankton. In marked contrast, the Coronation Island region was dominated by dense, discrete acoustic target patches which were classified as larger, nektonic, sound scatterers (fish or squid), and only 12% of targets there were classified as zooplankton. Elsewhere, data from predator diet analyses carried out at Bird Island, South Georgia, during the same season that our acoustic measurements were made, confirm the profoundly low levels of krill availability there and support the acoustic observation that the Willis Islands region contained large numbers of small zooplankton such as the amphipod Themisto gaudichaudii. Similarly, available data on analyses of stomach contents of Chinstrap penguins nesting in a neighbouring region within an oceanographic setting similar to that of Coronation Island reveal the presence of more fish in the diet than usual. Conclusions drawn from acoustic observations as to the relative regional composition of pelagic biomass are therefore clearly supported by independent evidence gathered from predators, and the value of integrating predator/prey and acoustic studies to characterise the content of localised marine ecosystems is demonstrated.

Several studies have found benefits of krill oil against oxidative and inflammatory damage. Aims: We aimed at assessing the ability of krill oil to reduce intestinal inflammation by improving epithelial barrier integrity, increasing cell survival and reducing pathogenicity of adherent-invasive Escherichia coli. Methods: CACO2 and HT29 cells were exposed to cytomix (TNF alpha and IFN gamma) to induce inflammation and co-exposed to cytomix and krill oil. E-cadherin, ZO-1 and F-actin levels were analyzed by immunofluorescence to assess barrier integrity. Scratch test was performed to measure wound healing. Cell survival was analyzed by flow cytometry. Adherent-invasive Escherichia coli LF82 was used for adhesion/invasion assay. Results: In inflamed cells E-cadherin and ZO-1 decreased, with loss of cell-cell adhesion, and F-actin polymerization increased stress fibres; krill oil restored initial conditions and improved wound healing, reduced bacterial adhesion/invasion in epithelial cells and survival within macrophages; krill oil reduced LF82-induced mRNA expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Conclusions: Krill oil improves intestinal barrier integrity and epithelial restitution during inflammation and controls bacterial adhesion and invasion to epithelial cells. Thus, krill oil may represent an innovative tool to reduce intestinal inflammation. (C) 2015 Editrice Gastroenterologica Italiana S.r.l. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The intent was to subdivide the precautionary catch limit for krill among the SSMUs so as to preclude the inadvertent concentration of catches in a small portion of the surveyed area. Five options for allocating the catch limit among the SSMUs in the Scotia Sea are presented in this paper. The first four are static allocations where the allotment of catch to an SSMU is proportional to: (i) the historical catch within the SSMU; (ii) estimated predator demand in the SSMU; (iii) estimated standing stock of krill in the SSMU; and (iv) standing stock less predator demand in the SSMU. The fifth option is a dynamic allocation based on land-based predator monitoring conducted just prior to, or early in, the fishing season. For the purposes of illustration and comparison between the options, parameter estimates are made using available data, although it is recognised that considerable refinement of these estimates is possible. Qualitative conclusions are that: under the first two options a substantial portion (>65%) of the catch limit would be allocated to three or less of the SSMUs adjacent to large concentrations of land-breeding predators; under options (iii) and (iv) a similar portion of the catch limit would be directed to pelagic SSMUs beyond the foraging range of these predators but into areas where krill fishing has not regularly occurred; and under option (v), an example of an adjustable catch limit dependent on the results of ecosystem monitoring, the fishery would be restricted in some of its traditional fishing grounds during years of low krill availability. Under all five options there would be little effect on the existing fishery However, as catches increase, a trade-off may be drawn between options that displace the fishery from its current operating area, but reduce the potential for contravening the terms of the Convention, and options that do not displace the fishery, but are likely to contravene the terms of the CCAMLR Convention.																	1023-4063						2004	11						81	97									WOS:000225324900005

Timing of ovarian maturation, the percent of the population reproducing, and individual reproductive output (batch volume, embryo diameter) were measured. Indices have been developed to quantify the timing and intensity of reproduction in Antarctic krill. One finding important to estimates of population fecundity for this long-lived species is that the percent of the population reproducing can vary widely, from 10 to 98%. Each season was characterized as having delayed, average or advanced ovarian development. In this study we relate these indices to direct and indirect indicators of spring or annual food availability. The timing of the spring sea ice retreat and the extent of sea ice in the spring (September through November) appear to significantly affect the intensity and timing of reproduction in the population. Intensity of reproduction was highest under "average" conditions, and oocyte development fastest with conditions of a late retreat and high spring sea ice extent.																	0003-1569					FEB	2001	41	1					74	89		10.1668/0003-1569(2001)041[0074:EVAIIO]2.0.CO;2							WOS:000172505600007

Impact of submarine hydrothermal vents on the metal composition of krill and its excretion products	MARINE CHEMISTRY												We have measured the metal composition and estimated the excretion rate of trace elements (Ag, Cd, Co, Cu. Ni. Pb, V and Zn) by Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) in three locations (two located within a submarine hydrothermal vent field and one away from it) along the Antarctic Peninsula region of the Southern ocean. Results indicated that krill excreted large amounts of Ag, Cu, Ph and Zn, (range: 1.9-41.2 pmol Ag g DW-1 h(-1), 15.3-26.8 nmol Cu g DW-1 h(-1), 308.7-1118.3 pmol Ph g DW-1 h(-1) and 24.4-76.5 nmol Zn g DW-1 h(-1)), compared with the non-significant or undetectable release rates of Cd, Co, Ni and V. The metal composition of the excreted material from krill collected in the area of hydrothermal activity was similar to the metal composition reported for suspended particles emitted from those vents. Our results suggest that krill recycling of Ag, Cu, Pb and Zn could potentially influence trace metal concentrations in the water column of the Bransfield region of the Southern Ocean, and that the original source of metals to these waters may be hydrothermal vents.

Fractions with astaxanthin monoesters and diesters of Antarctic krill Euphausia superba were isolated. Astaxanthin esters were separated by C18-HPLC depending on the number of carbons and double bonds of esterified fatty acid(s). Small amounts of other lipids remained in the samples, but relative molecular masses of carotenoid esters could be measured by field desorption mass spectrometry without fragmentation and interference from contaminant lipids. The fatty acids were determined by calculation of difference between astaxanthin and astaxanthin esters. Only five kinds of fatty acids, dodecarroate, tetradecanoate, hexadecanoate, hexadecenoate and octadecenoate, were detected. Fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry and secondary ion mass spectrometry showed similar spectra. The fatty acid composition in astaxanthin esters was different from those in krill lipids. Therefore, determination of fatty acids in carotenoid esters by a combination of HPLC elution profile and mild mass spectrometry is found to be a useful tool. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc.

J	Krafft, BA; Krag, LA				Krafft, Bjorn A.; Krag, Ludvig A.			Assessment of mortality of Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) escaping from a trawl	FISHERIES RESEARCH												The overall purpose of this study was to estimate the mortality of Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) that escape from the most common mesh size used for codends (16 mm) in the current commercial fishery. The experiment was carried out off the South Orkney Islands (60 degrees 35'S, 45 degrees 30'W) using a covered codend sampling technique for retaining escaped krill, which thereafter were observed in holding tanks to monitor their mortality rate. Our results suggest that krill with smaller body lengths suffered higher mortality. However, sampling depth, haul duration and catch accumulation as well as handling effects onboard, such as exposure to temperature differences, likely increased the mortality rates in our experiment. The results indicates that mortality of krill which escape trawl nets is relatively small, suggesting that krill, in common with many other crustacean species, are fairly tolerant to a process of capture-and-escape.

J	Richerson, K; Santora, JA; Mangel, M				Richerson, Kate; Santora, Jarrod A.; Mangel, Marc			Climate variability and multi-scale assessment of the krill preyscape near the north Antarctic Peninsula	POLAR BIOLOGY												Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) densities vary in space and time across multiple scales, with consequences for krill predators, the krill fishery, and management decisions. We use acoustic data collected from 1997 to 2011 around the South Shetland Islands near the northern Antarctic Peninsula to quantify spatiotemporal patterns in krill biomass, distribution, and patchiness both within and across years. Moreover, we evaluate potential climate drivers of krill biomass and spatial organization through comparison with seasonally lagged climate indices. Krill abundance varied by an order of magnitude throughout the study period, with mean biomass ranging from a high of 171.9 g m(-2) in 1997 to a low of 9.4 g m(-2) in 2002. We find that across years, krill abundance and variability are correlated with seasonally averaged measures of El Nio-Southern Oscillation at lags of approximately 2-2.5 years, which may correspond to strong reproduction and recruitment events. Krill biomass shows generally weak to moderate spatial autocorrelation and high aggregation, with measures of spatial organization correlated with abundance in some habitats. Within years, there was an overall trend of declining krill abundance and/or detectability and contracted spatial distribution between midsummer and late summer, but this pattern was not consistent across all years. This synthesis provides the background to model krill prey landscapes in order to better understand regional foraging ecology of krill predators and fishery performance.

The pelagic tunicate Salpa thompsoni can also be important during spring and summer through the formation of extensive and dense blooms(6-9). Although salps are not a major dietary item for Antarctic vertebrate predators(7,10), their blooms can affect adult krill reproduction and survival of krill larvae. Here we provide data from 1995 and 1996 that support hypothesized relationships between krill, salps and region-wide sea-ice conditions(11,12). We have assessed salp consumption as a proportion of net primary production, and found correlations between herbivore densities and integrated chlorophyll-a that indicate that there is a degree of competition between krill and salps. Our analysis of the relationship between annual sea-ice cover and a longer time series of air temperature measurements(12,13) indicates a decreased frequency of winters with extensive sea-ice development over the last five decades. Our data suggest that decreased krill availability may affect the levels of their vertebrate predators. Regional warming and reduced krill abundance therefore affect the marine food web and krill resource management.																	0028-0836					JUN 26	1997	387	6636					897	900		10.1038/43174							WOS:A1997XG41600050						
J	Hill, SL; Phillips, T; Atkinson, A				Hill, Simeon L.; Phillips, Tony; Atkinson, Angus			Potential Climate Change Effects on the Habitat of Antarctic Krill in the Weddell Quadrant of the Southern Ocean	PLOS ONE												Antarctic krill is a cold water species, an increasingly important fishery resource and a major prey item for many fish, birds and mammals in the Southern Ocean. The fishery and the summer foraging sites of many of these predators are concentrated between 0 degrees and 90 degrees W. Parts of this quadrant have experienced recent localised sea surface warming of up to 0.2 degrees C per decade, and projections suggest that further widespread warming of 0.27 degrees to 1.08 degrees C will occur by the late 21st century. We assessed the potential influence of this projected warming on Antarctic krill habitat with a statistical model that links growth to temperature and chlorophyll concentration. The results divide the quadrant into two zones: a band around the Antarctic Circumpolar Current in which habitat quality is particularly vulnerable to warming, and a southern area which is relatively insensitive. Our analysis suggests that the direct effects of warming could reduce the area of growth habitat by up to 20%. The reduction in growth habitat within the range of predators, such as Antarctic fur seals, that forage from breeding sites on South Georgia could be up to 55%, and the habitat's ability to support Antarctic krill biomass production within this range could be reduced by up to 68%. Sensitivity analysis suggests that the effects of a 50% change in summer chlorophyll concentration could be more significant than the direct effects of warming. A reduction in primary production could lead to further habitat degradation but, even if chlorophyll increased by 50%, projected warming would still cause some degradation of the habitat accessible to predators. While there is considerable uncertainty in these projections, they suggest that future climate change could have a significant negative effect on Antarctic krill growth habitat and, consequently, on Southern Ocean biodiversity and ecosystem services.

J	Perissinotto, R; Gurney, L; Pakhomov, EA				Perissinotto, R; Gurney, L; Pakhomov, EA			Contribution of heterotrophic material to diet and energy budget of Antarctic krill, Euphausia superba	MARINE BIOLOGY												A novel approach was used to estimate the heterotrophic carbon component in the diet of the Antarctic krill Euphausia superba. Over 200 specimens from seven samples collected in the Lazarev Sea (January 1993 and 1995), at the Antarctic Polar Front (January 1993), and around South Georgia (February/March 1994) were dissected, and the total carbon content of their stomachs was estimated with a CHN-analyser. Gut-pigment contents were also measured by the gut-fluorescence technique in specimens collected at the same time, and the equivalent amount of their gut carbon was then subtracted from the total organic carbon content of guts from the same samples. The remaining carbon was assumed to originate entirely from heterotrophic food sources. This heterotrophic component accounted for a substantial proportion of the total food consumed by Antarctic krill, ranging from 17.4 to 98.9% of the mass of the gut contents (mean = 78.8% +/- 21.2 SD). The results make an important contribution to the elucidation of the energy budget of krill and its daily carbon ration. With a few exceptions, previous estimates were largely calculated from a solely autotrophic carbon source, and were unable to account for the metabolic requirements of E. superba. Krill plays an important role in Antarctic food webs, as it often constitutes similar or equal to 50% of the total biomass of the zoo-plankton, and produces fast-sinking, dense faecal pellets which are important in the vertical transport of organic carbon from the euphotic layer to the deep ocean. High consumption rates of smaller heterotrophic organisms by krill suggest that this large microphage may be more important than previously believed in re-packaging micro- and mesozooplankton into a longer-lasting and more easily sequestered carbon pool.																	0025-3162					FEB	2000	136	1					129	135		10.1007/s002270050015							WOS:000085966300015						
J	Verdy, A; Flierl, G				Verdy, Ariane; Flierl, Glenn			Evolution and social behavior in krill	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY												We simulate the formation of social aggregations in a turbulent fluid environment. The theoretical framework is employed to investigate the ecological consequences of spatial patchiness in the density distribution of krill, which often assemble in swarms or schools. We first describe the formation of aggregations resulting from the interplay of social forces and population dynamics, and then consider an idealized ecosystem model of zooplankton with social behavior who feed on phytoplankton; this is solved analytically for the initial growth of patches and numerically for the steady-state distributions of predator and prey biomass. Environmental variability changes the linear instability criterion for spontaneous aggregation. The second part of the paper addresses the evolution of social behavior in a population with density-dependent mating success. The model simulates the transmission of a gene controlling social behavior; natural selection determines whether the grouping or non-grouping type becomes dominant. It is found that the behavior can evolve when mixing occurs rapidly enough for resources to remain available to the clustered organisms. Turbulent advection prevents the grouping type from becoming dominant if the shear of the flow is strong enough to disrupt the patches; otherwise the aggregated zooplankton benefit from enhanced diffusion of resources by the turbulent flow.

Furthermore, MIC values of antibiotics such as erythromycin and lincomycin were dramatically reduced in combination with OAKO against antibiotic-resistant bacteria. The combination of OAKO with erythromycin exhibited significant synergistic effect with fractional inhibitory concentration (sigma FIC) 0.375 and 0.503 against erythromycin-resistant P. acnes and P. aeruginosa, respectively.

J	Nygard, T; Lie, E; Rov, N; Steinnes, E				Nygard, T; Lie, E; Rov, N; Steinnes, E			Metal dynamics in an Antarctic food chain	MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN												The concentrations of copper, zinc, cadmium, selenium and mercury were determined in eggs, muscle, liver, kidney and stomach content of nestlings and adults of the Antarctic petrel, Thalassoica antarctica, and its predator, the south polar skua, Chataracta maccormicki, from Svarthamaren, Dronning Maud Land, Antarctica. The dominant food of the petrels is krill, Euphausia superba. The results show relatively high levels of cadmium in krill, which is assumed to be the main reason for the high levels of cadmium in petrels and skuas. Cadmium is almost absent in eggs, but accumulates very rapidly with age in nestlings. The copper concentrations in livers of nestling petrels reach very high levels during growth. This may be seen in connection with physiological development processes. Mercury seems to be accumulated with age and between trophic levels. Among the nestlings, the mercury levels decrease with increasing age, which may be accomplished by the excretion of mercury through the growth of feathers and as a dilution effect during growth. Selenium and mercury are inversely correlated in nestlings. The levels of zinc were similar for different nestling stages and between nestlings and adults in skuas and petrels.

Hydrolysates prepared from the krill were added to lizard fish myofibrils, and changes in the amount of unfrozen water in myofibrils during freezing were analyzed by differential scanning calorimetry. Ca-ATPase activity of myofibrils was measured concurrently and the results were compared with those using hydrolysates from shrimp. The amount of unfrozen water increased after addition of the hydrolysates and decreased moderately during frozen storage. When hydrolysates were not added to myofibrils, the amount of water rapidly decreased during frozen storage. The decrease in ATPase activity during frozen storage followed that of unfrozen water, indicating a close correlation between ATPase activity and the amount of unfrozen water. These results suggest that the denaturation of myofibrils may be suppressed by the addition of hydrolysates, since the hydrolysates appeared to increase the amount of unfrozen water.																	1344-6606					AUG	2002	8	3					200	206		10.3136/fstr.8.200							WOS:000177888000002						
J	Kruger, L				Kruger, Lucas			Spatio-temporal trends of the Krill fisheries in the Western Antarctic Peninsula and Southern Scotia Arc	FISHERIES MANAGEMENT AND ECOLOGY												Krill fisheries in Antarctica have concentrated their effort on the Western Antarctic Peninsula and Scotia Arc (WAP) in the last decades, following a steady increase in annual catch. Short-term shifts in habitat exploration may have occurred and may be the cause for the increasing catch. Habitat use and effort in krill fisheries in the WAP during summer between 2012/2013 and 2016/2017, inclusive, were tested to determine how habitat use and effort reflected in the catch. Increasing trends in fishing tow duration and depth of fishing in deeper and colder waters were found. No association of the catch with the habitat explored was found, but catch was higher in years when the variability of explored habitat was lower. The relevance of these findings for fisheries management and conservation of Antarctic marine ecosystems is discussed.

Size selection of Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) in a commercial codend and trawl body	FISHERIES RESEARCH												During fishing, many fish species are able to avoid the net walls of the trawl body and so the majority of size selection occurs in the codend of the net. Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) are regarded as true planktonic organisms passively drifting with currents, but they also display self-locomotion by active swimming. There is a lack of knowledge regarding the behavior of krill during the fishing process, and extrapolating results obtained for other species to krill is of limited value. In the case of krill, it is largely unknown to what extent the codend versus the trawl body contributes to the size selection process. The current study aims to quantify the size selection of krill in a commercially applied codend during experimental fishing. Combining these results with a model for full trawl size selectivity it was possible to provide an insight to the size selection process in the trawl body. Specifically, the study applied a two-step approach by first estimating the size selectivity of a commercial codend and second used the codend size selectivity obtained in this study to estimate the trawl body size selectivity of a commercial trawl based on entire trawl-selectivity obtained in a previous study. The results of this two-step analysis revealed that the trawl body contributes significantly to the total size selection process, demonstrating that size selectivity of Antarctic krill in commercial trawls is affected by both the trawl body and the codend.

The enantiomers of selenomethionine were converted into diastereomeric isoindole derivatives by reaction with o-phthaldialdehyde and N-isobutyryl-L-cysteine. This easy-to-handle reaction proceeds quantitatively in a few minutes at room temperature. Separation and detection of the diastereomers was achieved by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography-inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (RP-HPLC/ICP-MS) using a conventional C18 reversed-phase column. Detection limits of about 4 mug L-1 were obtained. The method was applied to the determination of the configuration of selenomethionine extracted from antarctic krill, which turned out to possess the L-Configuration.

ENSO and variability of the Antarctic Peninsula pelagic marine ecosystem	ANTARCTIC SCIENCE												The West Antarctic Peninsula region is an important source of Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) in the Southern Ocean. From 1980-2004 abundance and concentration of phytoplankton and zooplankton, krill reproductive and recruitment success and seasonal sea ice extent here were significantly correlated with the atmospheric Southern Oscillation Index and exhibited three- to five-year frequencies characteristic of El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) variability. This linkage was associated with movements of the Southern Antarctic Circumpolar Current Front and Boundary, a changing influence of Antarctic Circumpolar Current and Weddell Sea waters, and eastward versus westward flow and mixing processes that are consistent with forcing by the Antarctic Dipole high-latitude climate mode. Identification of hydrographic processes underlying ecosystem variability presented here were derived primarily from multidisciplinary data collected during 1990-2004, a period with relatively stable year-to-year sea ice conditions. These results differ from the overwhelming importance of seasonal sea ice development previously established using 1980-1996 data, a period marked by a major decrease in sea ice from the Antarctic Peninsula region in the late 1980s. These newer results reveal the more subtle consequences of ENSO variability on biological responses. They highlight the necessity of internally consistent long-term multidisciplinary datasets for understanding ecosystem variability and ultimately for establishing well-founded ecosystem management. Furthermore, natural environmental variability associated with interannual- and decadal-scale changes in ENSO forcing must be considered when assessing impacts of climate warming in the Antarctic Peninsula-Weddell Sea region.

It is essential to understand the variation of target strength (TS in dB re 1 m(2)) with the different body size to accurately estimate ice krill stocks. However, there is comparatively little knowledge of the acoustic backscatter of ice krill. The TS of individual, formalin-preserved, tethered ice krill was measured in a freshwater test tank at 38, 120, and 200 kHz with a calibrated split-beam echo sounder system. Mean TS was obtained from 21 individual ice krill with a broad range of body lengths (L: 13-36 mm). The length (L, mm) to wet weight (W; mg) relationship for ice krill was W=0.001218x10(3) x L (3.53) (R (2) =0.96). The mean TS-to-length relationship were TS38 kHz =-177.4+57log(10) (L), (R (2) = 0.86); TS120 kHz = -129.9+31.56log(10) (L), (R (2) =0.87); and TS200 kHz =-117.6+24.66log(10) (L), (R (2) =0.84). Empirical estimates of the relationship between the TS and body length of ice krill were established at 38, 120, and 200 kHz and compared with predictions obtained from both the linear regression model of Greene et al. (1991) and the Stochastic Distorted Wave Born Approximation (SDWBA) model. This result might be applied to improve acoustic detection and density estimation of ice krill in the Southern Ocean. Further comparative studies are needed with in situ target strength including various body lengths of ice krill.

Isotopic values in serially sampled whiskers of 34 leopard (Hydrurga leptonyx, HL), 13 crabeater (Lobodon carcinophaga, LC) and 14 Weddell (Leptonychotes weddellii, LW) seals were measured. Two clusters of leopard seals were identified based on their delta N-15 values: a high-trophic level group (HLhigh) and a low-trophic level group (HLlow). Overlap in SEAc was only seen between HL and LC, while HL and LW showed an overlap in their convex hulls, but no overlap in SEAc. Diet compositions estimated using Bayesian stable isotope mixing models revealed intra- and interspecific differences among seals. For leopard seals highest dietary contributor was krill, while for HLhigh krill and fish cephalopod were the main contributors. Mixing models run separately for each HL seal showed a large variation in the proportional contribution of krill (12-90%) compared to the other sources (cephalopods, fish, penguins and seals). The crabeater seals almost exclusively consumed krill, with a low contribution of the other prey. Weddell seals, on the other hand, showed a high proportion of fish and a lower contribution of cephalopods and penguins, while the contribution of krill seemed to be minimal. This study is the first to compare isotopic niches of three Antarctic seals from the WAP. Our results indicate that crabeater and leopard seals seem to have a strong and a considerable dependence on krill, respectively. Although the WAP is characterized by an unusually high production of Antarctic krill the large community of vertebrate predators that feed upon this resource (penguins, seals and baleen whales) should be especially vulnerable under future scenarios of reduction of krill biomass. Under the current drastic environmental changes in the WAP, continuing to monitor WAP seal diets and the relative contribution of krill to them will help understand the degree to which climate change may alter the population dynamics of these upper trophic level species.				botta, silvina/D-7528-2016; Rogers, Tracey L/C-3419-2008; Secchi, Eduardo R./ABF-1191-2020	Secchi, Eduardo R./0000-0001-9087-9909; Lima, Renan/0000-0002-9311-7085; Botta, Silvina/0000-0001-6219-6932; Rogers, Tracey/0000-0002-7141-4177												0967-0645	1879-0100				MAR	2018	149				SI		240	249		10.1016/j.dsr2.2017.11.005							WOS:000437037100022

Knowledge of the lipid biochemistry of krill assists in understanding their seasonal biology and predicting their responses to ecological changes. We collected daily samples of krill from a commercial fishing vessel operating in the Atlantic Sector of the Southern Ocean from 2014 to 2016. We analysed the total lipid content of krill sampled every two weeks and the relative distribution of lipid class levels to examine seasonal trends. Krill total lipid content varied significantly within and between seasons and sexes. An annual sinusoidal trend was seen in total lipid content with the highest values in autumn and the lowest in spring (average 380 and 87 mg/g dry mass, respectively). Total lipids in krill increased during summer, peaking in autumn, with the total lipids in winter individuals decreasing towards spring. The relative distribution of lipid class levels varied between season and year. Levels of triacylglycerol showed the same seasonal trend as total lipid content, whilst phospholipid showed the inverse trend indicating the contrasting roles of these two dominant lipid classes. These data provide high-resolution information on the seasonality of krill lipid content and composition. This information has both ecological and commercial utility.

Krill have long been recognized as key prey species for fish, birds, and marine mammals and as a target for fisheries in both hemispheres. However. the study of krill can contribute in many other areas of biology. Krill are an excellent model system for studies of growth and maturity, for connections between theory, experiment, and observation, and for tests of evolutionary theory in the field. Krill are also ideal model organisms for studying the interaction between environmental and organismal variability. Because they are widely distributed but only moderately speciose, the study of krill can also shed light on the relationship between abundance and range. The study of krill is an inherently interdisciplinary field, crossing boundaries and using a combination of oceanography, biochemistry, physiology, evolution, and ecology to understand krill and their role in the ecosystem.																	0706-652X						2000	57			3			1	5		10.1139/cjfas-57-S3-1							WOS:000166531600001

J	Demer, DA; Conti, SG				Demer, DA; Conti, SG			Reconciling theoretical versus empirical target strengths of krill: effects of phase variability on the distorted-wave Born approximation	ICES JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE												A model was recently proposed to predict the target strengths (TS) of Antarctic krill, Euphausia superba, versus incidence angle (theta) (Deep Sea Res. 1145(7) (1998) 1273). Based on the distorted-wave Born approximation (DWBA), the model depends on the coherent summation of scattering from elements of a discretized-bent cylinder. It was empirically validated at 120 kHz near-broadside incidence (theta approximate to 90degrees), but large discrepancies were observed at other angles away from the main lobe. As the side-lobe measurements were both higher than the model predictions and above the noise floor, the authors noted that the differences were not entirely due to noise. In this study, the accuracy of the DWBA model is further explored. Results indicate that phase variability in the scatter from elements of a discretized-bent cylinder (krill model) causes a dramatic flattening in the side-lobe regions of TS(theta), while negligibly affecting the main scattering lobe. These results are consistent with the krill TS measurements reported by McGehee et al. Thus, by accounting for phase variability in the solution of the DWBA model, a more accurate and thus practical tool is developed for predicting krill TS.

Fingerprinting Krill Oil by P-31, H-1 and C-13 NMR Spectroscopies	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN OIL CHEMISTS SOCIETY												The detailed analysis of krill oil is of importance to be able to differentiate other oils, identify adulterated products, and provide the highest quality associated with its beneficial health effects. The objective of this study was to demonstrate the usefulness of the combination of P-31, H-1 and C-13 nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopies to characterize the krill oil profile. It was found that in contrast to fish oil, where eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) fatty acids are found in triacylglycerol, krill oil is characterized by a more asymmetric fatty acid distribution with a higher polyunsaturated fatty acids PUFA content in the sn-2 position of phospholipids and lower amounts in triacylglycerol. Besides the typical asymmetric fatty acid composition, several other markers were investigated for krill oil origin test. The validation of the P-31 NMR spectroscopic method regarding major phospholipid species was performed according to the Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) and International Council for Harmonisation (ICH) guidelines. The method was characterized by high sensitivity, accuracy, and reproducibility. Interlaboratory testing showed satisfactory robustness regardless of the type of NMR equipment used by different laboratories. High-resolution NMR spectroscopy has proven to be a convenient and exact method for providing a characteristic fingerprint of krill oil. By this technique, clear distinctions to other oils can be made through qualitative and quantitative analysis of krill oil.																	0003-021X	1558-9331				AUG	2016	93	8					1037	1049		10.1007/s11746-016-2836-3							WOS:000380274200003

Instead, there is now increasing recognition that alternative energy pathways through mid-trophic level groups (mesopelagic fish and squid) may be equally (if not more) important than the krill pathway in many regions. Ecosystem models are a valuable tool to synthesise existing data on the structure of marine food webs and to visualise and quantify alternative energy pathways. In this study we develop a static mass balance food web model for the southern Kerguelen Axis region (Prydz Bay and Princess Elizabeth Trough) to evaluate the importance of alternative energy pathways through mid-trophic level groups, including fish, squid and krill, in maintaining energy flow to top predators within East Antarctica. Our model reveals several major trophic pathways distinct from, and equally important to the Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) pathway. Using simple scenarios of reductions in krill biomass, we investigate how the system might switch to a state dominated by fish and squid pathways with the response of krill-reliant predators strongly dependent on their ability to switch to other prey sources. We conclude by discussing what these findings might suggest for the future vulnerability of East Antarctic food webs and the implications for future modelling work in the region.

Pronounced auto-degradation of myosin heavy chain and actin from krill protein was observed at alkaline pH values (pH 9.0-12.0), with maximum autolytic activity at about pH 12.0. Meanwhile, proteolytic activity in krill protein at pH 12.0 was observed at low temperatures, suggesting a possible cause for the autolysis of krill protein during the protein recovery process. Three major proteinases were detected by zymographic analysis of myofibrillar protein, with approximate molecular weights of 26 kDa (KP-1), 18 kDa (KP-2) and 17 kDa (KP-3). KP-3 was active over a pH range from pH 5.0-12.0, suggesting that it may be responsible for the autolysis of krill protein during alkaline-induced protein recovery. Further study on substrate specificity and inhibitory specificity of KP-3 showed that KP-3 is serine type proteinase.

Advective pathways near the tip of the Antarctic Peninsula: Trends, variability and ecosystem implications	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART I-OCEANOGRAPHIC RESEARCH PAPERS												Pathways and rates of ocean flow near the Antarctic Peninsula are strongly affected by frontal features, forcings from the atmosphere and the cryosphere. In the surface mixed layer, the currents advect material from the northwestern Weddell Sea on the eastern side of the Peninsula around the tip of the Peninsula to its western side and into the Scotia Sea, connecting populations of Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) and supporting the ecosystem of the region. Modelling of subsurface drifters using a particle tracking algorithm forced by the velocity fields of a coupled sea ice-ocean model (ORCA025-LIM2) allows analysis of the seasonal and interannual variability of drifter pathways over 43 years. The results show robust and persistent connections from the Weddell Sea both to the west into the Bellingshausen Sea and across the Scotia Sea towards South Georgia, reproducing well the observations. The fate of the drifters is sensitive to their deployment location, in addition to other factors. From the shelf of the eastern Antarctic Peninsula, the majority enter the Bransfield Strait and subsequently the Bellingshausen Sea. When originating further offshore over the deeper Weddell Sea, drifters are more likely to cross the South Scotia Ridge and reach South Georgia. However, the wind field east and southeast of Elephant Island, close to the tip of the Peninsula, is crucial for the drifter trajectories and is highly influenced by the Southern Annular Mode (SAM). Increased advection and short travel times to South Georgia, and reduced advection to the western Antarctic Peninsula can be linked to strong westerlies, a signature of the positive phase of the SAM. The converse is true for the negative phase. Strong westerlies and shifts of ocean fronts near the tip of the Peninsula that are potentially associated with both the SAM and the El Nino-Southern Oscillation restrict the connection from the Weddell Sea to the west, and drifters then predominantly follow the open paths to South Georgia and the east. Over the 43-year time series, the number of drifters advected into the Bellingshausen Sea decreases significantly by 23% and the travel time to South Georgia shortens significantly by 19% which corresponds to 56 days. We propose that these trends are linked, at least in part, to the increasingly positive trend in the SAM and, as such, this suggests an additional anthropogenic source of change to the regional ecosystem.

Echoes from krill were identified using the theoretical difference in echo intensity at 300 and 125 kHz and scaled to krill density using target strengths appropriate for krill in the region: krill size was determined from diet samples from furseals and penguins foraging near the moorings. A method using water flow past the moorings was developed to convert time-based acoustic observations of krill to area-based abundance estimates. Flow past the stationary moorings was treated analogously to motion along-track of a research vessel through a nominally stationary body of water during a conventional survey. The moorings thus provide a Eulerian view of variation in krill abundance. This is ecologically instructive for South Georgia, where krill are generally passive drifters on currents and where temporal fluctuations in abundance have significant consequences for krill-dependent predators. Moorings were positioned on routine research vessel survey transects, and validity of the mooring method was assessed by comparison of mooring and vessel observations. Krill density estimates from the moorings were not statistically different from vessel estimates in adjacent time periods. A time series of krill density from a mooring revealed step-changes that were not seen during short-term vessel surveys. Moorings deliver data over time scales that cannot be achieved from research vessels and provide insight on environmental factors associated with variation in krill abundance at South Georgia. Mooring data may aid ecosystem-based management.

J	KELLERMANN, A; SCHADWINKEL, S				KELLERMANN, A; SCHADWINKEL, S			WINTER ASPECTS OF THE ICHTHYOPLANKTON COMMUNITY IN ANTARCTIC PENINSULA WATERS	POLAR BIOLOGY												Ichthyoplankton was sampled from the Antarctic Peninsula area of the South Polar Ocean in early winter (May and June 1986). A total of 153 eggs from two species and 1368 larvae or juvenile stages from 12 species were obtained. These included pelagic species, and demersal species with a long pelagic larval or juvenile phase. Most abundant were larvae of Pleuragramma antarcticum and Notothenia kempi, and eggs of Notothenia neglecta. The distribution of notothenioid and paralepidid larvae was apparently unaffected by ice cover, whereas myctophid larvae were confined to ice-free waters. Areas where newly hatched Chionodraco hamatus occurred coincided with dense aggregations of Euphausia superba (Krill) furcilia larvae which is a potential food resource during winter. The hatching of icefish larvae during winter is apparently independent of the seasonal production cycle. Epipelagic eggs of Notothenia neglecta were found during the spawning season, which suggests that eggs ascend to the surface after demersal spawning and that development takes place near the sea surface during winter. Larvae of Notothenia kempi were chiefly confined to shelf and slope waters to the west of the Antarctic Peninsula, with larger larvae found in coastal shelf areas. Pleuragramma antarcticum occurred in the coastal waters off the Biscoe Islands, in the Gerlache Strait, and in the northern Bransfield Strait. The smallest larvae were found in the northern Bransfield Strait, whereas those at the Biscoe Islands and in Gerlache Strait waters were larger and of a similar size. A cyclonic gyre to the west of the Antarctic Peninsula observed in the austral summer was likely to have affected the larval drift of Pleuragramma antarcticum and Notothenia kempi. Differences in the timing of spawning and hatching and the vertical distribution of these larvae will lead to different transport and spatial distribution patterns. It is hypothesized that early winter conditions do not imply severe limitations on the year-class success of larval fish. Dispersal and increased mortality may occur during the second half of the winter.																	0722-4060					MAY	1991	11	2					117	127									WOS:A1991FN90600005

After this process, fluoride content per dry weight of the final product was remarkably reduced to <5 mg/kg, defluoridation efficiency was 99.70%, and water consumption was minimized. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy also indicated a decrease in the amount of fluorine, and basic chemical composition measurement indicated krill protein was not damaged during this process. Therefore, these results could be used as theoretical guidance for removing fluoride in practical application. Practical applications Defatted Antarctic krill powder is a cheap by-product after krill oil extraction, but it contains both high-quality protein and high concentration of fluoride. The toxicity of fluoride in krill powder makes it not be allowed as food resource. So, a new counter current extraction method was developed to defluorinate from defatted krill powder, which was an easy and cheap process, but high defluoridation efficiency with low water consumption. It has been successfully applied to the food pilot base, and it would help to obtain the safe defatted Antarctic krill powder in krill industry.

A compilation of parameters for ecosystem dynamics models of the Scotia Sea-Antarctic Peninsula region	CCAMLR SCIENCE												Expansion of the krill fishery in. the Scotia Sea-Antarctic Peninsula region beyond the current operational catch limit requires the development and assessment of methods for subdividing the precautionary catch limit amongst smaller spatial units. This paper compiles parameters for use in the ecosystem dynamic models that are needed to assess these methods. These parameters include life history and krill consumption parameters for the fish, whale, penguin and seal species that feed on krill in this region. Maximum krill transport rates are also derived from the OCCAM global ocean circulation model. This parameter set, like most others, is associated with considerable uncertainty, which must be taken into account when it is used. The sources, assumptions and calculations at every stage of the compilation process are therefore detailed, and plausible limits for parameter values are provided where possible. The results suggest that fish are the major krill consumers in all SSMUs, with perciform fish taking as much krill as whales, penguins and fur seals combined and myctophid fish taking double that amount. However, estimates of krill consumption per unit predator biomass suggest that this is an order of magnitude higher in penguins and seals than in whales and fish.

Samples were taken at 100, 300 and 500 m depth south of Elephant Island, Bransfield Strait and north of Livingston Island, and at 800 m to the east of Smith Island. Fifty four taxa of fish belonging to 11 families were collected. The diets of 2101 fish representing 38 taxa were examined. These were classified into three categories, fish feeders, krill feeders and benthos feeders. Fish prey species fed on krill and/or benthos. Krill was a major dietary component for 32 (84.2%) out of 38 taxa. Gobionotothen gibberifrons was distributed at all 10 stations (100-800 m in depth) and its diet comprised krill and benthos. The present findings verify the importance of krill in the Antarctic marine ecosystem and indicate that krill is consumed by benthic fish at greater depths than previously reported.																	0954-1020					DEC	1997	9	4					407	413		10.1017/S0954102097000527							WOS:000074000500007

Feeding and overwintering of Antarctic krill across its major habitats: The role of sea ice cover, water depth, and phytoplankton abundance	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) were sampled in contrasting habitats: a seasonally ice-covered deep ocean (Lazarev Sea), ice-free shelves at their northern range (South Georgia) and the Antarctic Peninsula (Bransfield Strait), and shelf and oceanic sites in the Scotia Sea. Across 92 stations, representing a year-round average, the food volume in krill stomachs comprised 71 +/- 29% algae, 17 +/- 21% protozoans, and 12 +/- 25% metazoans. Fatty acid trophic markers showed that copepods were consistently part of krill diet, not a switch food. In open waters, both diatom and copepod consumption increased with phytoplankton abundance. Under sea ice, ingestion of diatoms became rare, whereas feeding on copepods remained constant. During winter, larvae contained high but variable proportions of diatom markers, whereas in postlarvae the role of copepods increased with krill body length. Overwintering differed according to habitat. Krill from South Georgia had lower lipid stores than those from the Bransfield Strait or Lazarev Sea. Feeding effort was much reduced in Lazarev Sea krill, whereas most individuals from the Bransfield Strait and South Georgia contained phytoplankton and seabed detritus in their stomachs. Their retention of essential body reserves indicates that krill experienced most winter hardship in the Lazarev Sea, followed by South Georgia and then Bransfield Strait. This was reflected in the delayed development from juveniles to adults in the Lazarev Sea. Circumpolar comparisons of length frequencies suggest that krill growth conditions are more favorable in the southwest Atlantic than in the Lazarev Sea or off East Antarctica because of longer phytoplankton bloom periods and rewarding access to benthic food.																	0024-3590	1939-5590				JAN	2014	59	1					17	36		10.4319/lo.2014.59.1.0017							WOS:000339901800002

In the current study, destabilization of the medial meniscus (DMM) mouse model was used to investigate the effects of Antarctic krill peptides (AKP) on cartilage protection. As observed, AKP clearly ameliorate cartilage degeneration as evidenced by increased cartilage thickness and cartilage area and decreased histological Osteoarthritis Research Society International (OARSI) scores. Toluidine blue staining showed that AKO remarkably inhibited the loss of cartilage matrix in mice with OA. Hypoxia-inducible factor-2 alpha (HIF-2 alpha) has a key role in catabolic regulation and inflammation cascades which are the main causes of OA. AKP can down-regulate the expression of HIF-2 alpha and its downstream genes such as MMP-13, Adamts-S, IL-1 beta, iNOS, CXCL-1, and NOS2. Consistent with this, anabolic genes such as Acan and Col2 alpha 1 were restored after treatment with AKP. Chondrocyte apoptosis and the reduction in cartilage cell viability are also involved in the process of OA. The HIF-2 alpha-mediated death receptor apoptosis signaling pathway has been involved in the regulation of chondrocyte apoptosis. AKP can reduce the expressions of key pro-apoptosis genes in Fas-FasL and DR3-DR3L signaling pathways such as Fas, FasL, FADD, caspase8, caspase3, DR3, DR3L, RIP, and NF-kappa B. In addition, expressions of antiapoptosis genes such as c-AIP and c-FLIP were increased significantly. These findings indicate that AKP can be used as a new functional factor in the development of functional foods and chondroprotective drugs.																	0021-8561	1520-5118				MAR 20	2019	67	11					3125	3133		10.1021/acs.jafc.8b05841							WOS:000462260500007	30798606

The main CPUE indices were catch per vessel-days fished (CVDF), catch per extended vessel-days fished (CEVDF) and catch per hour of trawling (CHT). A relatively high correlation between mean monthly values of CVDF and CEVDF, and CVDF and CHT was observed. However, the correlation between daily mean values was quite low as a result of significant fluctuations in haul duration due to the different fishing strategies used when targeting krill intended for different end products, i.e. human consumption, krill meal and frozen krill. Daily mean CVDF and CHT calculated for specific strategies were well correlated. Depending on the fishing strategy used, the number of hauls per day ranged from 1 to 15. The duration of hauls ranged from 0.1 to 16 hours. When a final product of higher quality was required, haul durations were shorter and, accordingly, the number of hauls per day was higher. The correlation between catch and tow time was considered to be an indicator of homogeneity in krill distribution. The utility of CPUE for direct evaluation of relative changes in quantitative parameters of krill distribution inside fishing grounds is assessed.																	1023-4063						2004	11						165	177									WOS:000225324900011						
J	Hagen, W				Hagen, W			Reproductive strategies and energetic adaptations of polar zooplankton	INVERTEBRATE REPRODUCTION & DEVELOPMENT					8th International Congress on Invertebrate Reproduction	AUG 10-14, 1998	AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS					Key factors governing polar ocean ecosystems are low temperatures and a pronounced seasonal variability of ice cover, light regime and primary production. Depending on their ecological niche and trophic position, zooplankton species at high latitudes have developed a variety of reproductive strategies and energetic adaptations to cope with these extreme environmental conditions. Life-cycle strategies of the herbivorous copepods and euphausiids, which make up the major portion of polar zooplankton biomass, include seasonal vertical migration, dormancy (diapause, quiescence) and the accumulation of energy reserves. These lipid stores help to buffer the pulsed seasonal food supply, and they play an important role in fueling reproduction independent of phytoplankton. Only a smaller fraction of the lipid reserves accumulated during spring and summer are usually catabolized for metabolic maintenance during the food-limited dark season. These deposits are retained until the end of winter and allow early egg production and spawning prior to - or coinciding with - the onset of vernal primary production. It enables the new generation to make full use of the short productive season for growth and development to reach viable overwintering stages. The Antarctic krill Euphausia superba is an exception since it uses its depot lipids for metabolic maintenance during the dark season. It therefore relies on external resources (primary production) for reproductive processes, resulting in a later spawning period as compared to the other euphausiids. Another important component of the herbivorous Antarctic zooplankton, the salps, have developed a very different reproductive strategy. They are able to switch from sexual reproduction to asexual budding (metagenesis), which allows extreme multiplication rates under favourable feeding conditions. Due to these successful adaptations, herbivores are able to build up huge stocks, in spite of the short productive period. Omnivorous and carnivorous zooplankton species, e.g., amphipods or chaetognaths, are not much constrained by the seasonality problem, but experience a more constant food supply. They show a tendency towards K strategies with a prolonged reproductive period, reduced egg numbers and increasing parental care. However, they do not exhibit such typical "polar adaptations" as developed by the herbivorous species.

Public acceptance of krill for human consumption will depend partly on its nutritive value. The aim of this article is to assess the nutritive value and potential health benefits of krill, an abundant food source with high nutritional value and a variety of compounds relevant to human health. Krill is a rich source of high-quality protein, with the advantage over other animal proteins of being low in fat and a rich source of omega-3 fatly acids. Antioxidant levels in krill are higher than in fish, suggesting benefits against oxidative damage. Finally, the waste generated by the processing of krill into edible products can be developed into value-added products.

Continuous moulting by Antarctic krill drives major pulses of carbon export in the north Scotia Sea, Southern Ocean	NATURE COMMUNICATIONS												Antarctic krill play an important role in biogeochemical cycles and can potentially generate high-particulate organic carbon (POC) fluxes to the deep ocean. They also have an unusual trait of moulting continuously throughout their life-cycle. We determine the krill seasonal contribution to POC flux in terms of faecal pellets (FP), exuviae and carcasses from sediment trap samples collected in the Southern Ocean. We found that krill moulting generated an exuviae flux of similar order to that of FP, together accounting for 87% of an annual POC flux (22.8gm(-2) y(-1)). Using an inverse modelling approach, we determined the krill population size necessary to generate this flux peaked at 261gm(-2). This study shows the important role of krill exuviae as a vector for POC flux. Since krill moulting cycle depends on temperature, our results highlight the sensitivity of POC flux to rapid regional environmental change.

This study reports the results of an expressed sequence tag (EST) sequencing project from different tissues of Euphausia superba (the Antarctic krill). Results: We have constructed and sequenced five cDNA libraries from different Antarctic krill tissues: head, abdomen, thoracopods and photophores. We have identified 1.770 high-quality ESTs which were assembled into 216 overlapping clusters and 801 singletons resulting in a total of 1.017 non-redundant sequences. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis was performed to quantify and validate the expression levels of ten genes presenting different EST countings in krill tissues. In addition, bioinformatic screening of the non-redundant E. superba sequences identified 69 microsatellite containing ESTs. Clusters, consensuses and related similarity and gene ontology searches were organized in a dedicated E. superba database http://krill.cribi.unipd.it. Conclusion: We defined the first tissue transcriptional signatures of E. superba based on functional categorization among the examined tissues. The analyses of annotated transcripts showed a higher similarity with genes from insects with respect to Malacostraca possibly as an effect of the limited number of Malacostraca sequences in the public databases.

Glacial melting: an overlooked threat to Antarctic krill	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS												Strandings of marine animals are relatively common in marine systems. However, the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. We observed mass strandings of krill in Antarctica that appeared to be linked to the presence of glacial meltwater. Climate-induced glacial meltwater leads to an increased occurrence of suspended particles in the sea, which is known to affect the physiology of aquatic organisms. Here, we study the effect of suspended inorganic particles on krill in relation to krill mortality events observed in Potter Cove, Antarctica, between 2003 and 2012. The experimental results showed that large quantities of lithogenic particles affected krill feeding, absorption capacity and performance after only 24 h of exposure. Negative effects were related to both the threshold concentrations and the size of the suspended particles. Analysis of the stomach contents of stranded krill showed large quantities of large particles ( >10(6) mu m(3)), which were most likely mobilized by glacial meltwater. Ongoing climate-induced glacial melting may impact the coastal ecosystems of Antarctica that rely on krill.				Hass, H.

Recently, a new multi-enzyme preparation, krill enzyme, isolated from Antarctic shrimp-like organisms (Euphausia superba), was reported to possess powerful proteolytic activity towards protein substrates. In this paper, we study the in vitro digestive properties of krill enzymes towards whole tissue, compared with placebo, papain, and fibrinolysin/DNAse. Freshly obtained skin specimens were exposed for 3 days to krill enzymes (3; 0.6 and 0.06 U/ml), papain (120; 60; 6 and 0.6 U/ml), fibrinolysin/DNAse (2.5/1500 E and 1/600 E), and phosphate-buffered saline control solution. Tissue digestion was estimated by measuring wet Wt, dry wt, and histological examination. After 72 hr of exposure to 3 U/ml krill enzymes, the dry wt of the specimens was reduced to 2.7% +/- 1.9 (SEM, n = 5), compared with 31.0% +/- 2.7 for placebo, 25.7% +/- 2.5 for 120 U/ml papain, and 24.5% +/- 3.3 for 2.5/1500 E/ml fibrinolysin/DNAse. The differences between krill enzymes and fibrinolysin/DNAse, papain, and control solution were statistically significant (p < 0.007). These data suggest that krill enzymes are more active than other commonly available proteolytic agents used for wound debridement.

The effect on its dehydration efficiency, and effects on lipid extraction rate and lipid qualities and cost of the process were compared. The Antarctic krill was first treated by HPD, followed by the FD method. The lipids extracted from the various dehydrated samples were compared. In addition, the time and energy consumption during the process of dehydration and the physical properties such as color and microstructure of the Antarctic krill samples dehydrated by various drying methods were also compared. The results indicated that Antarctic krill drying by combined dehydration had good color and microstructure, which were both close to the FD sample, and better than the heat pump and hot air drying samples alone. The procedure was performed with an optimal dehydration temperature of HPD at 60 degrees C and a transition point of 40% moisture content, followed by freezing-drying up to moisture content of 10%. Lipids extracted from Antarctic krill dried through procedure would have high lipid extraction rate (21.02%), low acid value (10.4 mg KOH/g), high astaxanthin content (200 mg/kg). Importantly it would save about 62 and 50%, respectively, of time and energy consumption in comparison of freezing-drying method. Therefore, this study was for the first time to show that the combined dehydration of HPD and FD could be viable applicable dehydration method for Antarctic krill treatment. Practical applicationsHPD can provide efficient dehydration with a low temperature and energy consumption for high water content materials. The combined dehydration procedure of HPD and FD for Antarctic krill treatment could supply excellent quality of Antarctic krill as foodstuffs and for its further processes such as lipid extraction. This procedure would be more feasible for the food industrial processes.				cao, peirang/AAH-1746-2019	cao, peirang/0000-0003-4729-5478												0145-8876	1745-4530				DEC	2017	40	6							e12577	10.1111/jfpe.12577							WOS:000415899500022

Geospatial variability of krill and top predators within an Antarctic submarine canyon system	MARINE BIOLOGY												The spatial distribution patterns of krill, seabirds (penguin, petrel and albatross), fur seals and baleen whales were mapped in nearshore waters (< 50 km from land) to investigate their habitat selection within two adjacent submarine canyons near Livingston Island, Antarctica. Three shipboard surveys were conducted (February 2005-2007), and an echosounder was used to measure the distribution and abundance of krill while simultaneously conducting visual surveys to map seabird and marine mammals. Using a multispecies approach, we test the hypothesis that spatial organization of krill and top predators co-vary according to fine-scale changes in bathymetry in the nearshore marine environment. GAMs are used to examine the effect of sea depth, slope and distance to isobaths on the spatial distribution and abundance of krill and predators. Spatial distribution patterns of krill and predators relate to fine-scale (1-10 km) changes in bathymetry and exhibit cross-shelf gradients in abundance. Krill were concentrated along the shelf-break and abundant within both submarine canyons. Predators exhibited different preferences for locations within the submarine canyon system that relates to their foraging behavior. Penguins concentrated closer to shore and within the head of the east submarine canyon immediately adjacent to a breeding colony. Whales were also concentrated over the head of the east canyon (overlapping with penguins), whereas albatrosses and fur seals were concentrated in the west canyon. Fur seals also showed preference for steep slopes and were concentrated along the shelf-break. Petrels exhibited peaks in abundance throughout both submarine canyons. Owing to their orientation, size and proximity to the coastline, submarine canyons provide important habitat heterogeneity for krill and a variety of predators. This study highlights the multispecies approach for studying spatial ecology of top predators and krill and has implications for marine spatial management of the Scotia Sea.																	0025-3162					NOV	2011	158	11					2527	2540		10.1007/s00227-011-1753-0							WOS:000296088600013

Stable isotopes identify an ontogenetic niche expansion in Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) from the South Shetland Islands, Antarctica	MARINE BIOLOGY												Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) occupy a key position in the Southern Ocean linking primary production to secondary consumers. While krill is a dominant grazer of phytoplankton, it also consumes heterotrophic prey and the relative importance of these two resources may differ with ontogeny. We used stable isotope analyses to evaluate body size-dependent trophic and habitat shifts in krill during the austral summer around the South Shetland Islands, Antarctica. We found evidence for an asymmetric, ontogenetic niche expansion with adults of both sexes having higher and more variable delta N-15 values but consistent delta C-13 values in comparison with juveniles. This result suggests that while phytoplankton likely remains an important life-long resource, krill in our study area expand their dietary niche to include higher trophic food sources as body size increases. The broader dietary niches observed in adults may help buffer them from recent climate-driven shifts in phytoplankton communities that negatively affect larval or juvenile krill that rely predominately on autotrophic resources.

Estimates of growth rates of the Southern Ocean euphausiid Thysanoessa macrura are currently restricted to limited studies which rely upon repeated sampling and length-frequency analysis to quantify growth rates. The instantaneous growth method (IGR) was used to measure the growth rate of T. macrura successfully in the southern Kerulen Plateau region during summer, providing the first IGR parameters for the Southern Ocean euphausiid species. Results of the four-day IGR incubation indicate a period of low somatic growth for adult T. macrura. Males had a longer intermoult period (IMP) (62 days) than females (42 days), but the sexes exhibited similar daily growth rates of 0.011 mm day(-1) and 0.012 mm day(-1) respectively. Juveniles exhibited the fastest growth, with an IMP of 13 days and daily growth rate of 0.055 mm day(-1) indicating a prolonged growth season, similar to the Antarctic krill E. superba. Consequently, we highlight the usability of the IGR method and strongly encourage its use in developing a comprehensive understanding of spatial and seasonal growth patterns of T. macrura.

The first CRM of this kind (MURST-ISS-A1 Antarctic Marine Sediment) is already available. The second phase focuses on the certification of antarctic krill, a small shrimp extremely abundant in the Southern Ocean. The total mass of krill available for this purpose is approximately 44 kg and results from the combination of three different catches (Ross Sea, Marguerite Bay and Livingston Island, respectively). The quantification of the following elements in the raw mass appears to be affordable by current analytical techniques, values being in the range of (in mu g/g) 0.11-0.30 for As, 0.03-0.12 for Cd, 0.06-0.23 for Cr, 6.1-21 for Cu, 5.7-7.6 for Fe, 0.005-0.008 for Hg, 0.7-1.2 for Mn, 0.013-0.077 for Ni, 0.04-0.57 for Pb and 12-16 for Zn. On the other hand, the average values ascertained in freeze-dried krill are as a rule one order of magnitude higher, i.e., (in mu g/g), 3.2 for As, 0.6 for Cd, 1.8 for Cr, 75 for Cu, 61 for Fe, 0.025 for Hg, 4.6 for Mn, 0.7 for Ni, 2.1 for Pb and 81 for Zn.

Wintertime overlaps between female Antarctic fur seals (Arctocephalus gazella) and the krill fishery at South Georgia, South Atlantic	PLOS ONE												The diet of Antarctic fur seals (Arctocephalus gazella) at South Georgia is dominated by Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba). During the breeding season, foraging trips by lactating female fur seals are constrained by their need to return to land to provision their pups. Post-breeding, seals disperse in order to feed and recover condition; estimates indicate c.70% of females remain near to South Georgia, whilst others head west towards the Patagonian Shelf or south to the ice-edge. The krill fishery at South Georgia operates only during the winter, providing the potential for fur seal: fishery interaction during these months. Here we use available winter (May to September) tracking data from Platform Terminal Transmitter (PTT) tags deployed on female fur seals at Bird Island, South Georgia. We develop habitat models describing their distribution during the winters of 1999 and 2003 with the aim of visualising and quantifying the degree of spatial overlap between female fur seals and krill harvesting in South Georgia waters. We show that spatial distribution of fur seals around South Georgia is extensive, and that the krill fishery overlaps with small, highly localised areas of available fur seal habitat. From these findings we discuss the implications for management, and future work.

Over a 14 d period 38 swarms were sampled in a small area southwest of Elephant Island, South Shetland Islands. Analysis indicated that the composition of the swarms in terms of the sex ratio and maturity stage was very variable. Swarms ranged from equal mixtures of male and female krill to nearly all one sex; furthermore krill of similar maturity frequently occurred together. The mean length of each maturity stage also varied between swarms; in some swarms the size of each maturity stage was bigger than average while in others each stage was smaller than average. The range of krill sizes in a swarm was often restricted, indicative of some type of size sorting. However size sorting alone could not account for the observed variation in sex ratio and maturity stage and it is likely that in addition, differential growth and active behavioural responses contribute to the observed variation.																	0171-8630					JUN	1992	82	2					163	174		10.3354/meps082163							WOS:A1992HZ19000006

The Antarctic silverfish, Pleuragramma antarctica is a keystone pelagic species, that has been assessed on the IUCN Red list of threatened species as a species with "Least Concern". However, this species is unique as it is placed at one extreme of the notothenioid evolutionary/ecological axis that ranges from benthic to secondary pelagic life style. Its different life stages occur in unique environments such as the platelet ice for eggs, some of the inner shelf canyons for young larvae and at the shelf break with Antarctic krill swarms for juveniles and adults. The winter habitats are not known. In addition to the effects of climate change, a threat to this species is its bycatch in krill fisheries; however it has not been directly harvested since the 1980s. As a midtrophic species, P. antarctica is sensitive to environmental changes and should be monitored in protected scientific reference areas to obtain information on global change. For a midtrophic fish in a supposed wasp-waist ecosystem, strict regulation of bycatch and monitoring should be carried out in parallel with the monitoring of Antarctic krill and ice krill. The designation of protected areas is an important mechanism for preserving the essential habitats of P. antarctica in the Southern Ocean.

It was observed that krill were neither randomly nor evenly distributed within the swarms, particularly in larger swarms (extending for more than about 35 m along track), where there was significant evidence of krill concentration in the centre. Linear trends in density across swarms were also common. In swarms of intermediate size (15 to 35 m along track), these linear effects were predominantly negative, perhaps indicating reaction of the swarms to the approaching ship. Significant linear effects were present in the larger swarms as well, but in these, positive gradients were as common as negative ones. The effects of beam width on estimates of swarm density and internal structure made by echosounder are examined, and a method of correcting for these effects described. It was found that if no beam width correction is applied, artefacts are introduced into the apparent density structures, while the mean swarm density can be underestimated by as much as 50%.

Embryo development time was significantly related to temperature, and could be expressed either in an exponential model or Belehradek's equation. The Belehradek's equation. D = 2.7 e (-0.27T) + 2.92 D = 65.3(T + 8.8)(-1.13) The Belehradek's equation was compared with previous studies, and also with those on other marine crustaceans. The curve calculated by this equation was similar to those for other arctic zooplankton species. Hatching success ranged from 7 to 58%, and varied between each gravid female. The physical condition of gravid females may affect the embryo quality and the hatching success. The factors that determine embryo development time and hatching success are discussed by comparing the data with those from previous studies performed on euphausiids and other marine crustaceans.

Horizontal and vertical distribution of euphausiid species on the Western Antarctic Peninsula U.S. GLOBEC Southern Ocean study site	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY												The Western Antarctic Peninsula (WAP) is a site of high krill abundance and a likely source region for krill populations found to the north and east of the area. The U.S. GLOBEC Southern Ocean program studied factors that contribute to the overwintering success of krill in the region of Marguerite Bay, WAP. A MOCNESS net system was used to sample the vertical distribution and abundance of zooplankton relative to physical features (hydrography and circulation) during four broad-scale survey cruises in the fall and winter of 2001 and 2002. Four species were found throughout the study area on all four cruises: Euphausia superba, Euphausia crystallorophias. Euphausia triacantha, and Thysanoessa macrura. The species had significantly different horizontal and vertical distributions. Both E. superba and T. macrura were broadly distributed throughout the area, but the central 50% of their vertical distributions were distinct with E. superba most abundant in the upper 100 m in the coldest, freshest water (average temperature and salinity: -1.13 degrees C; 33.80) and T. macrura occurring between 100 and 250 m (at 0.01 degrees C; 34.228). E. crystailorophias had a more coastal distribution and was usually found deeper in slightly warmer and saltier water (-0.44 degrees C; 33.9982) than E. superba and either overlapped or was above T. macrura in depth. E. triacantha was much rarer and sporadically distributed in the study area and was found substantially deeper (center of distribution about 300 m) in the warmest saltiest water (1.40 degrees C; 34.65) than the other three euphausiid species. Larval distributions for E. superba indicated that at least some proportion of the populations resulted from reproduction and development on the continental shelf, and not solely from offshore reproduction and transport onto the shelf. A neutral particle tracking model was used to gain insight into the relative importance of shelf versus off-shelf origins for the larvae. The results suggest that a combination of offshore and onshore reproduction can account for the observed E. superba larval distributions in the U.S. SO GLOBEC study site. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Euphausiid distribution along the Western Antarctic Peninsula - Part B: Distribution of euphausiid aggregations and biomass, and associations with environmental features	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY												The distribution of euphausiids (Euphausia spp.) in the continental shelf region in and around Marguerite Bay, west of the Antarctic Peninsula, was studied in relation to aspects of the physical and biological environment. Acoustic, video, net, and environmental data were collected during surveys in the austral falls and winters of 2001 and 2002.. Application of the analysis methods described in Lawson et al. [2008. Euphausiid distribution along the Western Antarctic Peninsula-Part A: Development of robust multi-frequency acoustic techniques to identify euphausiid aggregations and quantify euphausiid size, abundance, and biomass. Deep-Sea Research II, this issue] to acoustic survey data demonstrated strong seasonal, inter-annual, and spatial variability in krill distribution. The distribution of krill aggregations was characterized by many small aggregations closely spaced relative to one another, punctuated by much fewer aggregations of very large size that accounted for the majority of overall biomass in the region. The greatest number of aggregations was found at depths less than 100 in, but biomass was usually greatest at deeper depths. Similar biomass levels were estimated for both the fall surveys and the winter of 2002 survey, while biomass during the winter of 2001 was an order of magnitude smaller. During fall, biomass estimates vertically integrated over the sampled portion of the water column were negatively associated with chlorophyll a concentrations, and some suggestion was observed of highest biomass in regions of lowest current magnitude and horizontal current gradient. Generalized additive models indicated that highest krill biomass was consistently associated with regions close to land where the temperature maximum below 200m depth was cooler than what was available over the shelf as a whole. Krill were thus not associated with regions where intrusions of warm and nutrient-rich circumpolar deep water onto the shelf were present, despite such intrusions being thought to be an important driver of primary productivity.

The forging strategies of Adelie penguins (Pygoscelis adeliae) have been studied to some extent in some Antarctic locations; however, sex-based differences in foraging in this species have only been studied in depth in East Antarctica. Therefore, in this study, we aim to determine whether sexual segregation drives the foraging ecology [in terms of foraging habitat and diet based on analysis of stable carbon (C-13) and nitrogen (N-15) isotopes, respectively] of Adelie penguins in the Antarctic Peninsula (Hope Bay) during the breeding season. Our results showed strong sexual isotopic spatial segregation. Females forage for more krill than fish in more offshore, pelagic waters in contrast to males which feed equally on both items in more inshore, benthic waters. These results suggest a link between foraging habitat and diet that differs according to sex, similar to that found in East Antarctica. Given these similarities, we hypothesise that the foraging ecology of Adelie penguins varies with sex throughout the Antarctic continent. Nevertheless, further research in other locations such as in western Antarctica is needed to confirm this hypothesis.				; Barbosa, Andres/C-3208-2008	Colominas-Ciuro, Roger/0000-0001-6312-0702; Barbosa, Andres/0000-0001-8434-3649												0722-4060	1432-2056				DEC	2018	41	12					2635	2641		10.1007/s00300-018-2395-1							WOS:000452376500021

Warming effects in the western Antarctic Peninsula ecosystem: the role of population dynamic models for explaining and predicting penguin trends	POPULATION ECOLOGY												The western Antarctica Peninsula and Scotia Sea ecosystems appear to be driven by complex links between climatic variables, primary productivity, krill and Avian predators. There are several studies reporting statistical relationships between climate, krill and Penguin population size. The Ad,lie (Pygoscelis adeliae), Chinstrap (P. antarctica) and Gentoo (P. papua) penguins appear to be influenced by interannual variability in sea-ice extent and krill biomass. In this paper we developed simple conceptual models to decipher the role of climate and krill fluctuations on the population dynamics of these three Pygoscelis penguin species inhabiting the Antarctic Peninsula region. Our results suggest that the relevant processes underlying the population dynamics of these penguin species at King George Island (South Shetland Islands) are intra-specific competition and the combined effects of krill abundance and sea-ice cover. Our results using population theoretical models appear to support that climate change, specifically regional warming on the western Antarctic Peninsula, represents a major driver. At our study site, penguins showed species-specific responses to climate change. While Chinstrap penguins were only influenced by krill abundance, the contrasting population trends of Ad,lie and Gentoo penguins appear to be better explained by the "sea-ice hypothesis". We think that proper population dynamic modeling and theory are essential for deciphering and proposing the ecological mechanisms underlying dynamics of these penguin populations.

The average flux of C-org from the layer 0-100 m in the areas rich in krill is nearly the same as in the rest part of the Antarctic, but In the places of extremely high concentrations of krill it may be several times more than the average value. In such regions the flux of dead krill is much more intensive than that of faeces, and thus, it serves as the main source of food for the bottom fauna. The krill fishery does not significantly influence the annual flux value (F-a/F-Pi = 0.1), but it can play an important role in the formation of local concentrations of the bottom fauna.																	0030-1574					NOV-DEC	1996	36	6					888	891									WOS:A1996WG16000013

''Agulhas'' Voyage 70) and the South Georgia shelf (R,V. ''Africana'' Voyage 119) during the austral summer of 1993 were analyzed to estimate the variability of crucial parameters of the gut fluorescence technique in relation to food availability and krill feeding history. Gut evacuation rates (k) and passage or throughput times (1/k) varied in the ranges of 0.101 to 0.424 h(-1) and 2.3 to 9.9 h and were strongly correlated (p <0.001, r(2) = 0.98) to krill feeding activity (estimated as initial gut pigment content, G(o)) but not to ambient chlorophyll a concentration. A significant difference was found when k values derived from incubations in filtered seawater and low charcoal particle concentrations (0.4 to 0.8 mg l(-1)) were compared with values derived from krill fed high concentrations of charcoal (6 mg l(-1)). The efficiency of gut pigment destruction was among the highest recorded for zooplankton organisms, 58.1 to 98.4%, and did not covary significantly (p > 0.05) with ambient food concentration. However, the pigment lost per individual krill was strongly correlated with the total amount of pigment ingested(p < 0.001, r(2) = 0.99). We suggest that both gut evacuation rates and pigment destruction efficiency may be realistically estimated only when krill is allowed to continue ingesting particles uninterruptedly. Charcoal particle concentration should be equivalent to the in situ wet weight of total seston per unit volume. An objective criterion for the standardization of the measurement and calculation of k values is also proposed.																	0025-3162					MAR	1996	125	1					47	54		10.1007/BF00350759							WOS:A1996UD84100005

Population Structure and Life History Connectivity of Antarctic Silverfish (Pleuragramma antarctica) in the Southern Ocean Ecosystem	ANTARCTIC SILVERFISH: A KEYSTONE SPECIES IN A CHANGING ECOSYSTEM	Advances in Polar Ecology											Antarctic silverfish (Pleuragramma antarctica) are the most important pelagic forage fish on the Antarctic continental shelf. They have an exclusively pelagic life history, including cryopelagic eggs and early larvae. The discovery of extensive distributions of eggs and larvae under fast-ice inside Terra Nova Bay, and the revelation that the aggregates were stable between years, suggested dispersal over the continental shelf by older larvae and juveniles and a return as adults to spawning areas, consistent with observations from the Antarctic Peninsula of large-scale adult movement inshore. This life history hypothesis holds promise for understanding population structure in silverfish found around the Antarctic continental shelf. However, the hypothesis is challenged by inconsistencies concerning the distribution of spawning and feeding areas, a low-energy life strategy, and lack of phylogenetic diversification. We review recent and past population and genetic studies in the context of published literature on the physical environment, including hydrography and a recent geological reconstruction of Antarctic Ice Sheet deglaciation. We suggest physical-biological interactions between glacial trough systems, circulation, and life history processes in shaping distributions of silverfish along and across the shelf. We discuss how these processes may result in a richly diverse population structure around the Antarctic and over time, and show how the synthesis can help account for (1) variability in spawning and feeding areas over succeeding glacial cycles, (2) connectivity without invoking active migration on large spatial scales, and (3) persistence over successive glacial cycles without further phylogenetic diversification. Based on this synthesis, we make predictions concerning population structuring and genetic signatures of paleo-climatic events, and suggest multi-disciplinary approaches to test these in future research.

J	Buchholz, F				Buchholz, F			Experiments on the physiology of Southern and Northern krill, Euphausia superba and Meganyctiphanes norvegica, with emphasis on moult and growth - A review	MARINE AND FRESHWATER BEHAVIOUR AND PHYSIOLOGY					International Workshop on Understanding Living Krill for Improved Management and Stock Assessment	OCT 01-04, 2002	NAGOYA, JAPAN					Physiological data are needed for life history studies on krill, and as parameters for input into energy budgets and models. In conjunction with moult and growth data, these may also prove useful for assessing the fishable biomass of krill. Here, the development of physiological concepts in experimental krill research is briefly evaluated, with emphasis on the gaps to be filled. Krill growth is very flexible, as well as strongly temperature and nutrition dependent. The polar Antarctic krill Euphausia superba grows as fast as the boreal species Meganyctiphanes norvegica , at least during the first 2.5 years, and the species are comparable in terms of physiological plasticity. Accordingly, as krill appear to adjust quickly to specific laboratory conditions, short-term experiments are essential if field conditions are to be reflected as closely as possible. Furthermore, direct comparisons between laboratory experiments and swarming studies in the field are advantageous. For these, M. norvegica is particularly well-suited, as swarms can be followed over longer times and more easily than in E. superba . For example, processes of moult and reproduction were found to be highly coordinated in swarms and populations of Northern krill. For this species a conceptual model of reproduction was developed based on a combination of short-term laboratory observations coupled with field data on moult and ovary stages. In further physiological experiments krill should be studied as groups when swarming. Using proxies, that is applying physiological and/or biochemical methods side by side, is a promising way to enhance the reliability of life history data.																	1023-6244	1029-0362				DEC	2003	36	4					229	247		10.1080/10236240310001623376							WOS:000187994400005

Total lipid was highest in E. superba small juveniles (16 mg g(-1) wet mass), ranging from 12 to 15 mg in other euphausiids. Polar lipid (56-81% of total lipid) and triacylglycerol (12-38%) were the major lipids with wax esters (6%) only present in E. tricantha. Cholesterol was the major sterol (80-100% of total sterols) with desmosterol second in abundance (1-18%). 1997 T macrura and E. superba contained a more diverse sterol profile, including 24-nordehydrocholesterol (0.1-1.7%), trans-dehydrocholesterol (1.1-1.5%), brassicasterol (0.5-1.7%). 24-methylenecholesterol (0.1-0.4%) and two stanols (0.1-0.2%). Monounsaturated fatty acids included primarily 18:1(n-9)c (7-21%), 18:1(n-7)c (3-13%) and 16:1(n-7)c (2-7%). The main saturated fatty acids in krill were 16:0 (18-29%), 14:0 (2-15%) and 18:0 (1-13%). Highest eicosapentaenoic acid [EPA, 20:5 (n-3)] and docosahexaenoic acid [DHA, 22:6(n-3)] occurred in E. superba (EPA, 15-21%; DHA, 9-14%), and were less abundant in other krill. E. superba is a good source of EPA and DHA for consideration of direct or indirect use as a food item for human consumption. Lower levels of 18:4(n-3) in E. tricantha, E. frigida and T macrura (0.4-0.7% of total fatty acids) are more consistent with a carnivorous or omnivorous diet as compared with herbivorous E. superba (3.7-9.4%). The polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) 18:5(n-3) and the very-long chain (VLC-PUFA), C-26 and C-28 PUFA, were not present in 1997 samples, but were detected at low levels in most 1998 euphausiids. Interannual differences in these biomarkers suggest greater importance of dinoflagellates or some other phytoplankton group in the Elephant Island area during 1998. The data have enabled between year comparisons of trophodynamic interactions of krill collected in the Elephant Island region, and will be of use to groups using signature lipid methodology.

Included in the VE composition was a newly described 'marine-derived' tocopherol (MDT), an unsaturated-isoprenoid derivative of alpha-tocopherol, that is attributed to enhancing antioxidant protection of cellular lipids at low temperature. MDT was found to co-exist with alpha-tocopherol in all Antarctic samples, ranging from 2.8 to 22.3% of the total VE composition. The highest level of VE was found in the liver of G. gibberifrons (VE=416.7 pmol/mg wet tissue) although this tissue had a low MDT composition (7.7%), whereas the greatest MDT composition was measured in the liver of C. gunnari (MDT=22.3%). In notothenioids, the pectoral adductor muscle, which has a high density of mitochondria, contained higher levels of VE than white myotomal muscle, but differences in MDT composition were small. Phytoplankton and krill also contained MDT, which supports the contention that MDT is obtained directly from the primary food chain. Our finding of MDT in Antarctic organisms is consistent with its putatively adaptive function to enhance antioxidant protection in coldwater metabolism. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

J	Catton, KB; Webster, DR; Kawaguchi, S; Yen, J				Catton, Kimberly B.; Webster, Donald R.; Kawaguchi, So; Yen, Jeannette			The hydrodynamic disturbances of two species of krill: implications for aggregation structure	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY												Krill aggregations vary in size, krill density and uniformity depending on the species of krill. These aggregations may be structured to allow individuals to sense the hydrodynamic cues of neighboring krill or to avoid the flow fields of neighboring krill, which may increase drag forces on an individual krill. To determine the strength and location of the flow disturbance generated by krill, we used infrared particle image velocimetry measurements to analyze the flow field of free-swimming solitary specimens (Euphausia superba and Euphausia pacifica) and small, coordinated groups of three to six E. superba. Euphausia pacifica individuals possessed shorter body lengths, steeper body orientations relative to horizontal, slower swimming speeds and faster pleopod beat frequencies compared with E. superba. The downward-directed flow produced by E. pacifica has a smaller maximum velocity and smaller horizontal extent of the flow pattern compared with the flow produced by E. superba, which suggests that the flow disturbance is less persistent as a potential hydrodynamic cue for E. pacifica. Time record analysis reveals that the hydrodynamic disturbance is very weak beyond two body lengths for E. pacifica, whereas the hydrodynamic disturbance is observable above background level at four body lengths for E. superba. Because the nearest neighbor separation distance of E. superba within a school is less than two body lengths, hydrodynamic disturbances are a viable cue for intraspecies communication. The orientation of the position of the nearest neighbor is not coincident with the orientation of the flow disturbance, however, which indicates that E. superba are avoiding the region of strongest flow.

EFFECTS OF RECRUITMENT VARIABILITY AND NATURAL MORTALITY ON GENERALISED YIELD MODEL PROJECTIONS AND THE CCAMLR DECISION RULES FOR ANTARCTIC KRILL	CCAMLR SCIENCE												The generalised yield model (GYM) was used by CCAMLR to establish the precautionary catch limit for the Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) fishery. The current precautionary catch limit was based on supplying the GYM with a natural mortality rate of 0.8 and recruitment variability generated using a Beta distribution for proportional recruitment of krill. In this study, krill sampling data for empirical size frequencies were supplied to the GYM as the 'vector of recruitments' input option to simulate the population dynamics of krill around the Antarctic Peninsula (Subarea 48.1) along with increasing rates of natural mortality. The annual proportions of krill less than 36 mm in length to the total captured in net samples in four sampling areas of the Peninsula were used as proxies for recruitment variability. The variability of proportional recruitment in the CCAMLR study areas was similar to the variability in other krill studies and in the annual size distributions of krill in penguin diets. Simulations with either no fishing, or with fishing at the trigger level (lowest catches), at approximately half the precautionary catch limit (intermediate), or at the precautionary catch limit (highest) were conducted. As the values for natural mortality, recruitment variability and catch were increased, fewer of the scenarios were able to meet the CCAMLR decision rules. The higher precautionary level of catch was not obtainable while meeting CCAMLR decision criteria for at least two of the four recruitment vectors based on net sampling, regardless of how the specified parameters for recruitment and mortality were combined. Any substantial future increases in krill harvests in Area 48 beyond the trigger level require verification that the krill recruitment variability, natural mortality, and other parameters specified in the scenarios used to test management criteria, adequately represent the range of plausible values encompassing krill population biology.																	1023-4063						2013	20						81	96									WOS:000326924700006

A key species of the Southern Ocean ecosystem, the Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) has evolved rhythmic physiological and behavioral mechanisms to adapt to daily and seasonal changes. The molecular organization of the clockwork underlying these biological rhythms is, nevertheless, still only partially understood. Methodology/Principal Findings: The genome sequence of the Antarctic krill is not yet available. A normalized cDNA library was produced and pyrosequenced in the attempt to identify large numbers of transcripts. All available E. superba sequences were then assembled to create the most complete existing oligonucleotide microarray platform with a total of 32,217 probes. Gene expression signatures of specimens collected in the Ross Sea at five different time points over a 24-hour cycle were defined, and 1,308 genes differentially expressed were identified. Of the corresponding transcripts, 609 showed a significant sinusoidal expression pattern; about 40% of these exibithed a 24-hour periodicity while the other 60% was characterized by a shorter (about 12-hour) rhythm. We assigned the differentially expressed genes to functional categories and noticed that those concerning translation, proteolysis, energy and metabolic process, redox regulation, visual transduction and stress response, which are most likely related to daily environmental changes, were significantly enriched. Two transcripts of peroxiredoxin, thought to represent the ancestral timekeeping system that evolved about 2.5 billion years ago, were also identified as were two isoforms of the EsRh1 opsin and two novel arrestin1 sequences involved in the visual transduction cascade. Conclusions: Our work represents the first characterization of the krill diurnal transcriptome under natural conditions and provides a first insight into the genetic regulation of physiological changes, which occur around the clock during an Antarctic summer day.

The extensive data now available on the lipids of Arctic and Antarctic euphausiids show that all species are characterised by a seasonally high lipid content. and neutral lipids. whether wax esters or triacylglycerols, are primarily accumulated for reproduction. The Arctic Thysanoessa inermis and the Antarctic Euphausia crystallorophias contain high levels of wax esters and higher concentrations of 18:4(n-3) and 20:5(n-3) and a lower ratio of 18:1(n-9)/(n-7) fatty acids in their neutral lipids than the Arctic Thysanoessa raschii and the Antarctic Thysanoessa macrura and Euphausia superba. Large amounts of phytol in the lipids of T. raschii and E. crystallorophias during winter suggest the ingestion of decaying algae originating in sedimenting material or in sea ice. Thysanoessa raschii, T. macrura, and E. superba have a high ratio of 18:1(n-9)/(n-7) fatty acids, indicating animal carnivory. We conclude that T. inermis and E. crystallorophias are true high polar herbivores. while T. raschii. T. macrura. and E. superba are omnivores with a more boreal distribution.

Euphausia superba as a major control on copepod abundance	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												Euphausia superba thereafter 'krill') and copepods are major zooplankton taxa in the Southern Ocean, but there is Little information on how they interact. This paper investigates their coincidence across a wide range of temporal and spatial scales to examine whether copepod distribution is related to that of krill. During 2 summers of high krill abundance near South Georgia (1996 and 1993) copepod abundance was <40% of that during an abnormally low krill year (1994). No such depletion was found north of the Polar Front, where krill were rare. Analysis of 2 mesoscale data sets showed that krill, rather than food or environmental factors, were most strongly implicated in copepod distribution. An area of persistently high krill abundance just north of South Georgia was characterised by exceptionally few copepods. Fine-scale relationships between patches of krill and copepods were studied with a Longhurst Hardy Plankton Recorder. Within krill swarms copepod abundance was low, but more dispersed krill associated with high concentrations of copepods. Copepods also appeared to live deeper and to make more extensive vertical migrations when krill were present. The inverse relationship between krill and copepod abundances thus occurred repeatedly and across a wide range of scales. The facts that krill swarms are mobile and were unrelated to hydrography further suggest that the inverse relationship was caused by krill. This could arise from competitive exclusion, direct predation or both. Evidence for competition is that South Georgia copepods rely on high phytoplankton biomass for recruitment and krill can remove this. Predation is suggested by the fact that crustaceans were found in krill guts in this region during both summer and winter. During the 1996 summer, experiment tally derived predation rates on copepods, combined with krill biomass values, suggested a significant impact on small copepods. Therefore we suggest that copepod numbers can be controlled by a combination of competition and predation by krill.

To synchronize their daily and seasonal life-traits with their highly rhythmic environment, krill rely on the implementation of rhythmic strategies which might be regulated by a circadian clock. A recent analysis of krill circadian transcriptome revealed that their clock might be characterized by an endogenous free-running period of about 12-15 h. Using krill exposed to simulated light/dark cycles (LD) and constant darkness (DD), we investigated the circadian regulation of krill diel vertical migration (DVM) and oxygen consumption, together with daily patterns of clock gene expression in brain and eyestalk tissue. In LD, we found clear 24 h rhythms of DVM and oxygen consumption, suggesting a synchronization with photoperiod. In DD, the DVM rhythm shifted to a 12 h period, while the peak of oxygen consumption displayed a temporal advance during the subjective light phase. This suggested that in free-running conditions the periodicity of these clock-regulated output functions might reflect the shortening of the endogenous period observed at the transcriptional level. Moreover, differences in the expression patterns of clock gene in brain and eyestalk, in LD and DD, suggested the presence in krill of a multiple oscillator system. Evidence of short periodicities in krill behavior and physiology further supports the hypothesis that a short endogenous period might represent a circadian adaption to cope with extreme seasonal photoperiodic variability at high latitude.

Here, one bacterial protease, three bacterial chitinases and one insect N-acetyl-D-hexosaminidase were integratively used to produce peptide, N,N'-diacetylchitobiose [(GlcNAc)(2)] and N-acetyl-D-glucosamine (GlcNAc) from DKP. First, alkaline protease was found to outperform neutral protease in deproteinizing DKP and the resultant krill peptides were rich in essential amino acids (41.4%). Second, the mutant of chitinase A from Serratia marcescens [SmChiA-F232W/F396W (SmChiA-M)] was found to be 32% faster than wild-type SmChiA in hydrolyzing the deproteinized DKP (DDKP) and showed significant synergy with chitinase B from S. marcescens (SmChiB) and chitinase C from S. marcescens (SmChiC).

Spatial assessment of fin whale hotspots and their association with krill within an important Antarctic feeding and fishing ground	MARINE BIOLOGY												Fin whale (Balaenoptera physalus quoyi) habitat use and its relationship to environmental conditions are generally unknown in the Southern Ocean, presenting challenges for predicting their seasonal occurrence and potential effects of fishing pressure and climate change on this endangered species. Using biological data collected during 14 shipboard surveys off the northern Antarctic Peninsula and oceanographic data from satellite remote sensing, we mapped the distribution of fin whale hotspots, Antarctic krill abundance (biomass from acoustics, concentrations from nets) and ocean conditions during mid- and late-summer to investigate the environmental determinants of whale hotspots. Generalized additive models (GAM) were used to test the hypothesis that intra-seasonal changes in fin whale hotspot distribution relate to sea surface temperature (SST), krill abundance and eddy kinetic energy (EKE). More whale hotspots (sightings and individuals) are observed during late- than mid-summer surveys. During mid-summer, hotspots occurred near Elephant Island while in late-summer they were distributed throughout the slope region in proximity to the mean location of the southern Antarctic Circumpolar Current Front. The spatial mean of EKE did not differ between mid- and late-summer surveys, but the spatial mean of SST was significantly warmer during late-summer. The GAM for mid-summer indicates that fin whale hotspots were positively related to SST, EKE and acoustically determined krill biomass. The GAM for late-summer indicates the hotspots were negatively related to net-based krill abundance and positively related to acoustic krill biomass and EKE. This study is important because environmental determinants of fin whale hotspots may be used as reference points for implementing future conservation plans for their recovering populations.																	0025-3162	1432-1793				OCT	2014	161	10					2293	2305		10.1007/s00227-014-2506-7							WOS:000342415200009						
J	Nicol, S; Worby, A; Leaper, R				Nicol, Stephen; Worby, Anthony; Leaper, Rebecca			Changes in the Antarctic sea ice ecosystem: potential effects on krill and baleen whales	MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH												The annual formation and loss of some 15 million km(2) of sea ice around the Antarctic significantly affects global ocean circulation, particularly through the formation of dense bottom water. As one of the most profound seasonal changes on Earth, the formation and decay of sea ice plays a major role in climate processes. It is also likely to be impacted by climate change, potentially changing the productivity of the Antarctic region. The sea ice zone supports much wildlife, particularly large vertebrates such as seals, seabirds and whales, some exploited to near extinction. Cetacean species in the Southern Ocean will be directly irnpacted by changes in sea ice patterns as well as indirectly by changes in their principal prey, Antarctic krill, affected by modifications to their own environment through climate change. Understanding how climate change will affect species at all trophic levels in the Southern Ocean requires new approaches and integrated research programs. This review focuses on the current state of knowledge of the sea ice zone and examines the potential for climatic and ecological change in the region. In the context of changes already documented for seals and seabirds, it discusses potential effects on the most conspicuous vertebrate of the region, baleen whales.

Among colonial animals, pinnipeds and seabirds may have different provisioning strategies, due to differences in their ability to travel and store energy. We compared the foraging areas of lactating Antarctic fur seals and chinstrap penguins breeding at Seal Island, Antarctica, to investigate whether they responded differently to the distribution of their prey (Antarctic krill and myctophid fish) and spatial heterogeneity in their habitat. Dense krill concentrations occurred in the shelf region near the colony. However, only brooding penguins, which are expected to be time-minimizers because they must return frequently with whole food for their chicks, foraged mainly in this proximal shelf region. Lactating fur seals and incubating penguins, which can make longer trips to increase energy gain per trip, and so are expected to be energy-maximizers, foraged in the more distant (>20 km from the island) slope and oceanic regions. The shelf region was characterized by more abundant, but lower-energy-content immature krill, whereas the slope and oceanic regions had less abundant but higher-energy-content gravid krill, as well as high-energy-content myctophids. Furthermore, krill in the shelf region undertook diurnal vertical migration, whereas those in the slope and oceanic regions stayed near the surface throughout the day, which may enhance the capture rate for visual predators. Therefore, we suggest that the energy-maximizers foraged in distant, but potentially more profitable feeding regions, while the time-minimizers foraged in closer, but potentially less profitable regions. Thus, time and energy constraints derived from different provisioning strategies may result in sympatric colonial predator species using different foraging areas, and as a result, some central-place foragers use suboptimal foraging habitats, in terms of the quality or quantity of available prey.

There is now extensive evidence that there are years when there is a very low abundance of Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) in the South Georgia area, and that this variation affects much of the ecosystem, with the most obvious impacts on survival and breeding success of some of the major predators on krill. The open nature of the South Georgia ecosystem means this variability has large-scale relevance, but even though there are unique time series of data available, information on some key processes is limited. Fluctuations in year-class success in parts, or all, of the krill population across the Scotia Sea can generate large changes in the available biomass. The ocean transport pathways maintain the large-scale ecosystem structure by moving krill over large distances to areas where they are available to predator colonies. This large-scale physical system shows strong spatial and temporal coherence in the patterns of the interannual and subdecadal variability. This physical variability affects both the population dynamics of krill and the transport pathways, emphasizing that both the causes and the consequences of events at South Georgia are part of much larger-scale processes.

Intra-and inter-seasonal variations in krill biomass density and dispersion were derived from the re-processed data set for surveys conducted in the austral summers of 1991/1992 through 2001/2002. Estimated biomass density ranged from I to 60 g m(-2), decreasing from mid-range levels in 1991/1992 to a minimum in 1992/1993-1993/1994, increasing to a peak in 1996/1997-1997/1998, and decreasing again through 2000/2001-2001/2002. Although this variability may be attributed to changes in the spatial distribution of krill relative to the survey area, comparisons with the proportion of juvenile krill in simultaneous net samples suggest that the changes in biomass density are consistent with apparent changes in reproductive success. A truncated Fourier series fit to the biomass density time series is dominated by an 8-year cycle and predicts all increase in krill biomass density in 2002/2003 and 2003/2004. This prediction is supported by an apparent association between cycles in the extent of sea ice cover and per-capita krill recruitment over the last 23 years and indications that ice cover in the winter of 2002 is seasonally early and extensive.

Using supercritical carbon dioxide (SC-CO2) extraction with optimal extractions conditions of 45 A degrees C, 25MPa, and CO2 flow rate of 22 g/min, most of the neutral lipids were extracted. PC, PE and PI were then extracted in a second step conducted with modified existing method using ethanol, hexane and acetone as solvents. The major PL of krill residues was quantified by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC-ELSD). The fatty acid compositions of total PL, PC, PE and PI were analyzed by gas chromatography (GC). A significant amount of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) was present in both total and PLs fractions. The purified PLs were characterized by their acid value, peroxide value, and the oxidative stability. The purity of PL ranged between 93 and 97% and was evaluated by spectrophotometry.

Diets that replaced FM with KM at proportions of 0, 7, 15 and 30% (control, KM7, KM15, and KM30) were fed to groups of rainbow trout for 92 days and growth was observed. In fish fed KM7 and KM 15, weight gain (WG), feed intake (FI) and specific growth rate (SGR) were unchanged compared with fish fed the control diet, but in fish fed KM30, WG, FI and SGR significantly decreased. After the experiment, fluoride concentration in dorsal muscles of each experimental group was below the detected limit (1 mg/kg), but in vertebral bones, the fluoride concentration increased with each increase in KM inclusion in the diets: 490 mg/kg (control), 755 mg/kg (KM7), 1100 mg/kg (KM15), and 2400 mg/kg (KM30). Tissue specimens of liver of each experimental group had no histopathological changes. Therefore, accumulation of fluoride in vertebral bones apparently adversely affected growth of the vertebral bones thus affecting the growth performance as shown by the decrease in WG, FI and SGR.

The pattern of exploitation has shifted from one group of resources to another. The recent efforts of the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources are considered in relation to management of finfish exploitation and to the development of a scientifically based management plan for krill. Special emphasis is given to the data required for the effective management of the krill fishery, per se, given the current limited knowledge of the potential yield of the resource and in the face of uncertainty concerning key aspects of the species' biology/ecology. A recent South African initiative aimed at developing a practical management strategy for the Antarctic krill resource is described.																	0257-7615						1991	10						321	339									WOS:A1991GP22400029						
J	Miller, AK; Trivelpiece, WZ				Miller, Aileen K.; Trivelpiece, Wayne Z.			Chinstrap penguins alter foraging and diving behavior in response to the size of their principle prey, Antarctic krill	MARINE BIOLOGY												Penguins may exhibit plasticity in their diving and foraging behaviors in response to changes in prey availability. Chinstrap penguins are dependent predators of Antarctic krill in the Scotia Sea region, but krill populations have fluctuated in recent years. We examined the diet of chinstrap penguins at Livingston Island, South Shetland Islands, in relation to their diving and foraging behavior using time-depth recorders over six breeding seasons: 2002-2007. When krill were smaller, more chinstrap penguins consumed fish. In these years, chinstrap penguins often exhibited a shift to deep dives after sundown, and then resumed a shallower pattern at sunrise. These night dives were unexpectedly deep (up to 110 m) and mean night dive depths sometimes exceeded those from the daytime. The average size of krill in each year was negatively correlated to mean night dive depths and the proportion of foraging trips taken overnight. Based on these patterns, we suggest that when krill were small, penguins increasingly targeted myctophid fish. The average krill size was negatively correlated to the time chinstrap penguins spent foraging which suggests that foraging on smaller krill and fish incurred a cost: more time was spent at sea foraging.																	0025-3162	1432-1793				APR	2008	154	2					201	208		10.1007/s00227-008-0909-z							WOS:000254751400001

The IC50 values of Trp-Phe (0.32 +/- 0.05 mg/mL) and Phe-Ala-Ser (0.15 +/- 0.02 mg/mL) on ACE inhibitory activity were significantly (p <= .05) lower than those of the other six peptides. Furthermore, Trp-Phe, Tyr-Arg-Lys, Phe-Gln-Lys, and Phe-Ala-Ser did not only increase the nitric oxide (NO) concentration and decreased the content of endothelin-1 (ET-1) in the medium of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) in a dose dependent manner after 24 h, but also significantly reversed the decreased production of NO in the presence of 0.5 mu M norepinephrine and the effect of NE on ET-1 production. These results indicate that the isolated anti hypertensive peptides can correct the endothelial cell dysfunction induced by norepinephrine.																	0963-9969	1873-7145				JUL	2019	121						197	204		10.1016/j.foodres.2019.03.035							WOS:000470048200021	31108740

Ready to spawn females, have high lipid content in ovaries, while in males and spent females, the major site of lipid deposits was the digestive gland, followed by the fat body. These differences among spawning and spent females are indicative of strong interactions between the ovary and digestive gland and the ovary and fat body during vitellogenesis. Triacylglycerols (TAG) were the major neutral lipid class with high levels in the digestive gland. The major phospholipid was phosphatidylcholine (PC) particularly in the muscular tissue of the abdomen. Phosphatidyl-ethanolamine (PE) and -serine-inositol (PS-PI), were present at intermediate levels. Reproductive males were depleted in TAG and diacylglycerols (DAG) in the digestive gland, gonad and fat body, and had 4 times lower cholesterol in the gonad than ready to spawn females. Furthermore, ready to spawn females had in the ovary higher amounts of TAG, DAG and phospholipids (PC, PE, PS-PI) than spent females. Linear relationships between lipid content and main lipid class (TAG, PC, PE, PS-PT) in different fractions of males and ready to spawn females showed that: (1). TAG was stored for both sexes in all cephalothorax fractions with highest values in the digestive gland and ovary fluid; (2). PC was accumulated for both sexes in the fat body and the gonad with a higher slope for females, with the highest values in the ovary fluid and in the abdomen of males and that (3). PS-PI was stored only in the ovary and abdomen of mature females. These results are discussed in terms of the strategy developed by Meganyctiphanes norvegica to allocate lipids to the next generation for optimised embryogenesis. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Inc.

J	Thorpe, SE; Heywood, KJ; Stevens, DP; Brandon, MA				Thorpe, SE; Heywood, KJ; Stevens, DP; Brandon, MA			Tracking passive drifters in a high resolution ocean model: implications for interannual variability of larval krill transport to South Georgia	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART I-OCEANOGRAPHIC RESEARCH PAPERS												A particle tracking scheme that uses velocity output from an interannually varying forced run of a global ocean circulation model (Parallel Ocean Climate Model; POCM_4C) allows variability in the transport pathways across the Scotia Sea to South Georgia to be examined for the first time. The time-variant surface fluxes introduce realistic variability into the model velocity fields. This causes large variations in near-surface, mixed-layer transport from the Antarctic Peninsula region to South Georgia, an island in the southwest Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean. The variability occurs on a variety of timescales with seasonal and longer periods of variability apparent in the 18 year time series of results. A quasi-four year period of variability is evident across the region in the sea surface temperature fields of POCM_4C and appears in the particle tracking results. This period, noted in other Southern Ocean data sets and ascribed to the Antarctic Circumpolar Wave, has been observed in the reproductive success of higher marine predators breeding on the island. The predicted oceanographic variability is likely to be significant for the South Georgia ecosystem by affecting the influx into the region of Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba), the main prey of the higher predators.

At-sea behaviour of three krill predators breeding at Bouvetoya-Antarctic fur seals, macaroni penguins and chinstrap penguins	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												Interspecific competition is an important structuring element in marine ecosystems, especially in the Southern Ocean which offers few prey choices to comparatively large predator populations. We present the first simultaneous observations of at-sea behaviour and attendance patterns of 3 synchronously breeding, central place, krill foragers at Bouvetoya-a small, isolated, sub-Antarctic island in the South Atlantic. Time depth recorders and satellite transmitters were deployed during the austral summer of 2007/2008 on 47 lactating Antarctic fur seals Arctocephalus gazella (AFS) rearing pups and on 20 macaroni Eudyptes chrysolophus (MAC) and 30 chinstrap Pygoscelis antarctica penguins (CHIN) rearing chicks. All 3 species showed a strong preference for the west side of the island, and their foraging ranges overlapped markedly. Solar elevation influenced the timing of departures from, and arrivals to, the island with markedly different patterns between the seals and the penguins. Diving patterns also showed significant differences among the 3 species, with the frequency of diving being higher at night for the AFS, while both penguin species dove more frequently during the day. But a common, vertical diel pattern occurred in all 3 species, with shallow diving occurring at night and deep diving during the day, consistent with the vertical migration of krill. MACs targeted 2 depth layers for feeding, including a deep prey layer at similar to 70 m, which was not exploited by AFSs and CHINs. The results suggest that there is potential for competitive overlap among these 3 krill predators at Bouvetoya, but that it is reduced via both spatial (horizontal and vertical) and temporal partitioning of foraging areas.

Surface oceanography of BROKE-West, along the Antarctic margin of the south-west Indian Ocean (30-80 degrees E)	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY												Hydrographic CTD and ADCP data were collected during the BROKE-West research voyage (January-March 2006) in the south-west Indian Ocean sector of the Antarctic margin. These data describe the large-scale circulation, water masses, fronts and summertime stratification in the surface layer over the continental shelf, slope and rise region between 30 and 80 degrees E that forms CCAMLR Statistical Area 58.4.2. The surface circulation matched the full-depth circulation and consisted of the eastward flowing southern Antarctic Circumpolar Current front to the north, and the westward flowing Antarctic Slope Current associated with the Antarctic Slope Front along the continental slope to the south. Two sub-polar gyres were detected south of the Southern Boundary of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current: the eastern Weddell Gyre in the Cosmonaut Sea (30-50 degrees E) and the greater Prydz Bay Gyre in the Cooperation Sea (60-80 degrees E). In the eastern Weddell Gyre, the seasonal mixed layer depths were shallower, warmer and fresher relative to the regions to the east which were deeper, cooler and more saline. This spatial variability is found to be strongly correlated to the large-scale pattern of sea ice melt/retreat in the months preceding the voyage and the accumulated wind stress thereafter. Areas of upwelling warm deep waters into the surface layer are presented from positive anomalies of potential temperature and nutrient concentrations (nitrate and silicate). These anomalies were strongest in the eastern Weddell Gyre in the vicinity of the Cosmonaut Polynya/Embayment, north of Cape Anne and near the Southern Boundary of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current in the eastern sector of the survey. The summertime stratification (seasonal mixed layer, seasonal pycnocline and T(min) layer) are discussed relative to the distributions of chl a and acoustically determined Antarctic Krill (Euphausia superba) densities. Elevated chl a concentrations were found in the surface layer of the marginal ice zone and it is proposed that these are retained south of the fast, narrow jet of enhanced Antarctic Slope Current on the upper continental slope. There is qualitative evidence of these maxima being subducted and transported north in the seasonal pycnocline in response to Ekman convergence from the easterly winds in this region. The seasonal mixed layer within the sub-polar gyres had relatively low chl a concentrations with sub-surface maxima in the seasonal pycnocline and the top of the T(min) layer. Surface concentrations increased once again north of the Southern Boundary in the north-east of the survey. Krill and chl a concentrations were both co-located and decoupled at different locations across the survey. There was no clear oceanographic boundary influencing the distribution of the krill surveyed, though further work is necessary to properly synthesize this and other biological patterns with the oceanographic processes, given the varying time and length scales and intrinsic sampling limitations.

The krill biomass in the area surveyed (872,500 km(2)) was estimated to be 4.83 million tonnes with a CV of 17%. Dense aggregations of krill, although encountered infrequently, dominated the biomass estimate. At least 97% of these aggregations were less than 200 m in transected length, and the largest was 1 100 m. Large clusters of aggregations ( > 1 km in transected length) were encountered on 4 of the 18 transects, and these dominated the krill biomass encountered during the survey. Krill were more abundant, with a broader latitudinal distribution, in the west of the survey area (80-115 degrees E) than in the east (115-150 degrees E). The absence of krill and the presence of warmer oceanic waters characterized the northeastern sector of the surveyed area. Krill aggregations were most frequently encountered in the shelf break region where the summer ice edge, 1000 m isobath, and the Antarctic Slope Front (ASF) (associated with the cooler coastal and warmer oceanic waters) coincided. The majority of krill aggregations were found in the top LOO m of the water column, and when deeper ( > 100 m) aggregations occurred they were usually coincident with aggregations in the top 100 m. The mean krill density for the area surveyed was 5.54 g m(-2) consistent with previous observations that the Indian Ocean sector is relatively impoverished when compared with krill density values for the South Atlantic. This density is at the low end of the range of values reported for surveys around South Georgia, Elephant Island, and the adjacent Prydz Bay region. However, this low average biomass results from averaging over a few krill-rich areas with large areas where krill is scarce or absent. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Krill oil is being developed for the health. food and dietary supplement because it possesses of omega. 3 fatty acids and phospholipid. derived fatty acids; however, it was limited due to its multiple arsenic species residues. Here, we presented a high performance liquid chromatography. inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometric (HPLC-ICP-MS) method for the simultaneous, sensitive, and rapid quantification of five arsenic metabolites including organic and inorganic forms, then the method was applied to the analysis of arsenic species in krill oil. The analytes were separated on a hydroxide-selective anion. exchange column with sodium carbonate (38 mmol/L) and sodium acetate (15 mmol/L) as mobile phase at a flow rate of 0.6 mL/min for 15 min. Arsenic analytes were monitored with a triple quadrupole ICP mass spectrometer. Validation revealed that the method had a linear range from 0.5 to 500 mu g/L with R > 0. 9993. The LOD was 0.1-0.2 mu g/L and LOQ was 1.5-2.6 mu g/L with RSD< 5%. The standard addition method displayed a recovery range from 88.9% to 106.3%. Application of the method to arsenic species analysis in krill oil indicated that krill oil was a safe food or diet supplement.																	0253-3820	1872-2040				MAY	2016	44	5					767	772		10.11895/j.issn.0253.3820.150942							WOS:000378354200010

Atlantic salmon (mean weight 0.5 kg) were divided into four triplicate groups and fed a commercial fish meal based diets with 0, 100, 200 and 300 g krill kg(-1) feed, respectively, for 12 weeks. The fluoride concentrations in the experimental feeds were analysed to be 18, 132, 235 and 358 mg kg(-1), respectively. Growth, mortality and feed efficiency were recorded through the experiment. Fluoride concentration was measured in muscle, whole-body, and bone initially and after 12 weeks of feeding. The fluoride concentrations in the samples were determined by alkali fusion and fluoride ion-selective electrode. Growth, mortality and feed efficiency ratio were not affected by the dietary treatments. The results showed that fluoride concentration in muscle, whole body and bone were not affected by the dietary fluoride level. The fluoride concentration in the tissues showed great variation among replicates of the group given the same diet. Fillets of the fish varied between 0.3 and 1.4 mg fluoride kg(-1) wet weight, whereas the whole-body concentration of fluoride varied between 3.3 and 6.1 mg kg(-1) wet weight and the fluoride bone concentration varied between 5.8 and 7.2 mg kg(-1) fresh weight. These results suggest that Atlantic salmon are highly tolerant of dietary fluoride given as krill meal with concentration of fluoride up to 350 mg kg(-1) diet, and that accumulation of fluoride from feeding diets containing krill meal does not lead to tissue accumulation in the fish, at least over a short period of time.

Element concentrations in meals from krill and amphipods, - Possible alternative protein sources in complete diets for farmed fish	AQUACULTURE												In the marine environment, organisms from lower trophic levels seem as a good alternative to the traditional meal and oil sources. In the present study, meals were produced from Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba), Arctic krill (Thysanoessa inermis) and the Arctic amphipod Themisto libellula. Diets were then prepared for Atlantic salmon and Atlantic cod where up to 100% of the fish meal protein was replaced by protein from these organisms. Concentrations of copper (Cu), zinc (Zn), arsenic (As), cadmium (Cd), mercury (Hg) and lead (Pb) were determined by ICP-MS in the various krill and amphipod meals, complete diets and muscle samples from fish fed these diets. The element concentrations were related to growth and general fish health as well as present EU legislations on feed ingredients and complete diets. The cod showed no difference in growth during the trial, while salmon fed diets where 40% of the fish meal protein was replaced with Arctic krill or amphipod meal shoved improved SGR during the first period of feeding (first 100 days). No adverse effects on growth rate or fish health were observed in any fish species or treatment. Nevertheless, high levels of Cu were found in the meal from Antarctic krill (46 mg kg(-1) dry matter (dm)) resulting in a dietary level of Cu exceeding the upper limit for complete feedingstuff set by EU. Furthermore, the Cd level found in the meal from amphipod (12 mg kg(-1) dm) was 6 times higher than EU's upper limit. This indicates limitations for the use of certain zooplanktons as alternative protein sources in feed for farmed fish, unless future processing methods yield lower levels of these unwanted elements.

Advances in Technologies for Highly Active Omega-3 Fatty Acids from Krill Oil: Clinical Applications	MARINE DRUGS												Euphausia superba, commonly known as krill, is a small marine crustacean from the Antarctic Ocean that plays an important role in the marine ecosystem, serving as feed for most fish. It is a known source of highly bioavailable omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid). In preclinical studies, krill oil showed metabolic, anti-inflammatory, neuroprotective and chemo preventive effects, while in clinical trials it showed significant metabolic, vascular and ergogenic actions. Solvent extraction is the most conventional method to obtain krill oil. However, different solvents must be used to extract all lipids from krill because of the diversity of the polarities of the lipid compounds in the biomass. This review aims to provide an overview of the chemical composition, bioavailability and bioaccessibility of krill oil, as well as the mechanisms of action, classic and non-conventional extraction techniques, health benefits and current applications of this marine crustacean.					testai, lara/0000-0003-2431-6248; Cicero, Arrigo/0000-0002-4367-3884; Martelli, Alma/0000-0002-2090-7107; Cravotto, Giancarlo/0000-0001-7574-7350													1660-3397				JUN	2021	19	6							306	10.3390/md19060306							WOS:000666803800001	34073184					
J	KASAMATSU, F; JOYCE, GG				KASAMATSU, F; JOYCE, GG			CURRENT STATUS OF ODONTOCETES IN THE ANTARCTIC	ANTARCTIC SCIENCE												The current status of Antarctic Odontocetes - sperm whales Physeter catodon, killer whales Orcinus orca, long-finned pilot whales Globicephala melaena, hourglass dolphins Lagenorhynchus cruciger and poorly known species of beaked whales (family Ziphiidae) - were studied in Antarctic waters using data gathered in sighting surveys conducted from 1976/77 to 1987/88. Temporal variation in density demonstrated the different migration patterns by species, especially between sperm whale and killer whale. Spatial distributions during mid-summer demonstrated different peaks of occurrence for each species by latitude that suggest possible segregation between the species. Killer whales occur mainly in the very southernmost areas, sperm whales in the southern half of the study area, beaked whales (mostly southern bottlenose whales Hyperoodon planifrons) ranged over a wide area, and long-finned pilot whales and hourglass dolphins were mainly in the northern regions of Antarctic waters. Several longitudinal peaks of occurrence and apparent distribution gaps were identified for sperm, beaked and killer whales. Abundance estimates for south of the Antarctic Convergence in January are based on line transect theory and were 28 100 animals (coefficient of variation CV 0.18) sperm whales, 599 300 (0.15) beaked whales (mostly southern bottlenose whales), 80 400 (0.15) killer whales, 200 000 (0.35) long-finned pilot whales, and 144 300 (0.17) hourglass dolphins. Based on this, biomass of these species were estimated as 0.77 (sperm whales), 2.70 (beaked whales), 0.32 (killer whales), 0.16 (long-finned pilot whales) and 0.01 (hourglass dolphins) million tonnes. Consumption of food (mostly squid) by the Odontocetes is estimated as 14.4 million tonnes with 67% of the total consumed by beaked whales. Indirect consumption of Antarctic krill through the predation of squid by beaked whales is estimated to be c. 24 million tonnes. This value is similar to the estimate of krill consumption by penguins in the Antarctic (33 million tonnes). Odontocetes, especially southern bottlenose whales, are suggested to have a much greater role in the Antarctic ecosystem than has previously been considered.																	0954-1020					DEC	1995	7	4					365	379		10.1017/S0954102095000514							WOS:A1995TH80600005

Life Cycle Environmental Impacts of Three Products Derived from Wild-Caught Antarctic Krill (Euphausia superba)	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Concern has been voiced in recent years regarding the environmental implications of the Antarctic krill fishery. Attention has focused primarily on ecological concerns, whereas other environmental aspects, including potentially globally problematic emissions and material and energy demands, have not been examined in detail. Here we apply life cycle assessment to measure the contributions of krill meal, oil, and omega-3 capsules to global warming, ozone depletion, acidification, eutrophication, energy use, and biotic resource use. Supply chains of one krill fishing and processing company, Aker BioMarine of Norway, were assessed. Impacts of krill products were found to be driven primarily by the combustion of fossil fuels onboard the fishing vessel and a transport/resupply vessel. Approximately 190 L of fuel are burned per tonne of raw krill landed, markedly higher than fuel inputs to reduction fisheries targeting other species. In contrast, the biotic resource use associated with extracting krill is relatively low compared to that of other reduction fisheries. Results of this study provide insight into the broader environmental implications of the krill fishery, comparisons between products derived from krill and other species targeted for reduction, opportunities for improving the fishery's performance, and a baseline against which to measure future performance.

Scattering patterns are shown to demonstrate orientation dependence of krill TS. Length-to-wavelength ratio (L/lambda) dependencies of reduced (normalized by square of the body length) target strength are shown for some orientation distributions. The results can explain the well-organized experimental results. The variability of the TS of krill is large when L/lambda is larger than unity, therefore, a frequency around 70 kHz is superior to 120 kHz which is ordinarily used for krill surveys.																	0919-9268					JUN	1994	60	3					261	265		10.2331/fishsci.60.261							WOS:A1994PA97800004

Information on krill condition during winter and early spring is slowly evolving with our enhanced ability to sample at this time of year. However, because of the limited spatial and temporal data, our understanding of fundamental biological parameters for krill during winter is limited. Our study assessed the condition of larval (furcilia VI) and one year old juvenile krill collected in East Antarctica (116 degrees E-130 degrees E and 64 degrees S-66 degrees S) from September to October 2012. Krill condition was assessed using morphometric, elemental and biochemical body composition, growth rates, oxygen uptake and lipid content and composition. Diet was assessed using fatty acid biomarkers analysed in the krill. The growth rate of larvae was 0.0038 mm day with an inter-moult period of 14 days. The average oxygen uptake of juvenile krill was 0.30 +/- 0.02 mu l oxygen consumed per mg dry weight per hour. Although protein was not significantly different amongst the krill analysed, the lipid content of krill was highly variable ranging from 9% to 27% dry weight in juveniles and from 4% to 13% dry weight in larvae. Specific algal biomarkers, fatty acids ratios, levels of both long-chain (>= C-20) monounsaturated fatty acids and bacterial fatty acids found in krill were indicative of the mixed nature of dietary sources and the opportunistic feeding capability of larval and juvenile krill at the end of winter.

We collected acoustic data and key environmental data continuously across extensive gradients in the little-studied Southeast Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean. A total of 4791 krill swarms with swarm descriptors including swarm height and length, packing density, swimming depth and inter-swarm distance were extracted. Through multivariate statistics, swarms were categorized into 4 groups. Group 2 swarms were largest (median length 108 m and thickness 18 m), whereas swarms in both Groups 1 and 4 were on average small, but differed markedly in depth distribution (median: 52 m for Group 1 vs. 133 m for Group 4). There was a strong spatial autocorrelation in the occurrence of swarms, and an autologistic regression model found no prediction of swarm occurrence from environmental variables for any of the Groups 1, 2 or 4. Probability of occurrence of Group 3 swarms, however, increased with increasing depth and temperature. Group 3 was the most distinctive swarm group with an order of magnitude higher packing density (median: 226 ind. m(-3)) than swarms from any of the other groups and about twice the distance to nearest neighbor swarm (median: 493 m). The majority of the krill were present in Group 3 swarms, and the absence of association with hydrographic or topographic concentrating mechanisms strongly suggests that these swarms aggregate through their own locomotion, possibly associated with migration.

The aim of this study was to compare seasonal differences in enzyme activity and respiration rates of larval and postlarval krill to provide insights into their overwintering strategies. Respiration rates, activity of the metabolic enzyme citrate synthase (CS), and those of the digestive enzymes laminarinase and total proteinase were measured in austral summer west of the Antarctic Peninsula, and in autumn in the southwestern Lazarev Sea. The 100-fold difference in chlorophyll a concentrations between the two studies is representative of the classic transition from a summer bloom to sparse winter conditions. Correspondingly, adult krill showed reduced respiration rates and CS activity in autumn. However, their digestive enzyme activity was significantly higher, suggesting more efficient assimilation of food, at low food levels. Similar-sized larvae showed no summer-autumn differences in respiration rates and enzyme activity, supporting suggestions that they need to feed and grow year-round. However, trends in enzymatic activity varied between the larval stages measured, implying ontogenetic changes in body structure and function.

LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY-METHODS												A calibrated 120 kHz single-beam echo-sounder was integrated into an ocean glider and deployed in the Weddell Sea, Southern Ocean. The glider was deployed for two short periods in January 2012, in separate survey boxes on the continental shelf to the east of the Antarctic Peninsula, to assess the distribution of Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba). During the glider missions, a research vessel undertook acoustic transects using a calibrated, hull-mounted, multi-frequency echo-sounder. Net hauls were taken to validate acoustic targets and parameterize acoustic models. Krill targets were identified using a thresholded schools analysis technique (SHAPES), and acoustic data were converted to krill density using the stochastic distorted-wave Born approximation (SDWBA) target strength model. A sensitivity analysis of glider pitch and roll indicated that, if not taken into account, glider orientation can impact density estimates by up to 8-fold. Glider-based, echo-sounder-derived krill density profiles for the two survey boxes showed features coherent with ship-borne measurements, with peak densities in both boxes around a depth of 60 m. Monte Carlo simulation of glider subsampling of ship-borne data showed no significant difference from observed profiles. Simulated glider dives required at least an order of magnitude more time than the ship to similarly estimate the abundance of krill within the sample regions. These analyses highlight the need for suitable sampling strategies for glider-based observations and are our first steps toward using autonomous underwater vehicles for ecosystem assessment and long-term monitoring. With appropriate survey design, gliders can be used for estimating krill distribution and abundance.

The percentage of males in size classes of adult krill was generally high in krill of 30 to 35 mm total length, always low in 38 to 42 mm. krill, sometimes showed higher values in 45 to 50 rum krill, but always decreased in the largest krill (> 50 mm). This pattern was reproduced by a model simulation that assumed faster growth and a shorter lifespan for males when compared to females. These results suggest that the numbers of males should decline with time unless new recruits enter the population. Indeed, interannual variations in PM from the field (net collected data and penguin diet data) showed a decline in the proportion of males when several years of low recruitment followed a recruitment pulse. These results lead us to conclude that male krill grow faster and have a shorter lifespan than females in the natural environment.

Associated with these changes is a reported 38% and 81% per decade decline in the numerical density (hereafter density) of Antarctic krill Euphausia superba Dana, 1850, between 1976 and 2003. Few changes in other components of the ecosystem that could be attributed to such a change, such as a mass decline in krill-dependent predators, have been detected. In an ecosystem so dependent on this keystone species, a massive population decline in krill ought to have had an obvious effect. In the absence of such an effect, it is timely to revisit the issue of the purported decline in krill density. The original analysis that indicated a decline in krill density was based on the 2004 version of KRILLBASE, a database of net samples. We analysed the publicly available and updated version (version 1, accessed 30 November 2017) and our analyses did not suggest a significant decline in krill density. Rather, after accounting for sampling heterogeneity and habitat variables, average krill density appears to have been stable but with considerable inter-annual variability. Since our results were unable to find any evidence for a decline in krill density we recommend a re-appraisal of many of the paradigms that underlie much of the recent thinking about ecosystem change Antarctic waters. Such a revision is necessary to provide a firmer foundation for predictions of the effects of climate change and resource extraction on the Southern Ocean ecosystem.																	0278-0372	1937-240X				NOV	2018	38	6					656	661		10.1093/jcbiol/ruy072							WOS:000456691100002

The total-lipid data for E. superba exhibited seasonal variations, with low lipid levels in late winter/early spring and the highest levels in autumn. Seasonal changes were most pronounced in the immature and adult specimens. increasing from about 10% lipid of dry mass to more than 40%. The fatty-acid compositions of the younger stages were dominated by 20:5(n-3), 22:6(n-3) and 16:0. These are typical phospholipid fatty acids, which are major biomembrane constituents. The phospholipid composition was similar in the older stages. With increasing storage of triacylglycerols in the lipid-rich immature and adult stages, the fatty acids 14:0, 16:0 and 18:1(n-9) prevailed, comprising about 70% of total triacylglycerol fatty acids. The trophic-marker fatty acids 16:1(n-7) and 18:4(n-3), indicating phytoplankton ingestion, were less abundant. They reflected, however, the dependence of the larvae on phytoplankton as well as the seasonal changes in algal composition. The generally close linear relationships between fatty acids and lipid suggest that the fatty-acid compositions of the collected specimens were largely independent of the respective developmental stage, season and region. The linear fit indicates that triacylglycerol accumulation started at a level of about 5% of total lipid. Considering the various overwintering scenarios under discussion, the life cycle and reproductive strategies of krill are discussed in the context of the lipid metabolism and fatty-acid composition of E. superba. Lipid production is effective enough to accumulate large energy reserves for the dark season, but E. superba does not exhibit the sophisticated biosynthetic pathways known from other Antarctic euphausiids and copepods. Although important, lipid utilisation appears to be just one of several strategies of E. superba to thrive under the extreme Antarctic conditions, and this pronounced versatility may explain the success of this species in the Southern Ocean.

By contrast, despite having traces of minor components, the krill oil extracted using ethanol in step 3 (E-KO) was the most abundant in PL (59.52%) and n-3 PUFA (41.74%). The krill oil extracted using hexane in step 2 (H-KO) expressed medium contents of all the testing indices. The oils showed significant differences in the antioxidant capacity (E-KO > H-KO > A-KO) which exhibited positive correlation with the PL content. These results could be used for further development of a wide range of krill oil products with tailor-made functions.

Life history buffering in Antarctic mammals and birds against changing patterns of climate and environmental variation	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY												The consequences of warming for Antarctic long-lived organisms depend on their ability to survive changing patterns of climate and environmental variation. Among birds and mammals of different Antarctic regions, including emperor penguins, snow petrels, southern fulmars, Antarctic fur seals and Weddell seals, we found strong support for selection of life history traits that reduce interannual variation in fitness. These species maximize fitness by keeping a low interannual variance in the survival of adults and in their propensity to breed annually, which are the vital rates that influence most the variability in population growth rate (lambda). All these species have been able to buffer these rates against the effects of recent climate-driven habitat changes except for Antarctic fur seals, in the Southwest Atlantic. In this region of the Southern Ocean, the rapid increase in ecosystem fluctuation, associated with increasing climate variability observed since 1990, has limited and rendered less predictable the main fur seal food supply, Antarctic krill. This has increased the fitness costs of breeding for females, causing significant short-term changes in population structure through mortality and low breeding output. Changes occur now with a frequency higher than the mean female fur seal generation time, and therefore are likely to limit their adaptive response. Fur seals are more likely to rely on phenotypic plasticity to cope with short-term changes in order to maximize individual fitness. With more frequent extreme climatic events driving more frequent ecosystem fluctuation, the repercussions for life histories in many Antarctic birds and mammals are likely to increase, particularly at regional scales. In species with less flexible life histories that are more constrained by fluctuation in their critical habitats, like sea-ice, this may cause demographic changes, population compensation and changes in distribution, as already observed in penguin species living in the Antarctic Peninsula and adjacent islands.																	1354-1013	1365-2486				NOV	2008	14	11					2473	2488		10.1111/j.1365-2486.2008.01678.x							WOS:000260307100001

All of the genome sequences were purified by gene amplification using long polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and the products were subsequently used as templates for either direct sequencing using a primer-walking strategy or nested PCR with crustacea-versatile primers. Although we were unable to determine a portion of the genome owing to technical difficulties, the sequenced position, 14,606 bp long, contained all of the 13 protein-coding genes, 19 of the 22 transfer RNA genes, and the large subunit as well as a portion of the small subunit ribosomal RNA genes.

Evidence of resource partitioning between humpback and minke whales around the western Antarctic Peninsula	MARINE MAMMAL SCIENCE												For closely related sympatric species to coexist, they must differ to some degree in their ecological requirements or niches (e.g., diets) to avoid interspecific competition. Baleen whales in the Antarctic feed primarily on krill, and the large sympatric prewhaling community suggests resource partitioning among these species or a nonlimiting prey resource. In order to examine ecological differences between sympatric humpback and minke whales around the Western Antarctic Peninsula, we made measurements of the physical environment, observations of whale distribution, and concurrent acoustic measurements of krill aggregations. Mantel's tests and classification and regression tree models indicate both similarities and differences in the spatial associations between humpback and minke whales, environmental features, and prey. The data suggest (1) similarities (proximity to shore) and differences (prey abundance versus deep water temperatures) in horizontal spatial distribution patterns, (2) unambiguous vertical resource partitioning with minke whales associating with deeper krill aggregations across a range of spatial scales, and (3) that interference competition between these two species is unlikely. These results add to the paucity of ecological knowledge relating baleen whales and their prey in the Antarctic and should be considered in conservation and management efforts for Southern Ocean cetaceans and ecosystems.																	0824-0469	1748-7692				APR	2009	25	2					402	415		10.1111/j.1748-7692.2008.00263.x							WOS:000265228700009

The phylogenetic reconstructions indicated that the Antarctic species form a monophyletic clade separated by the non-Antarctic species. The results revealed a large genetic divergence between the Antarctic (E. superba and E. crystallorophias) and sub-Antarctic species (E. vallentini). The time of separation between these species, estimated from the molecular data, is around 20 million years ago, which is comparable with the geological time of the formation of a circum-Antarctic water circulation and the Antarctic Polar Frontal Zone. The euphausiid molecular phylogeny therefore represents evidence for vicariant speciation.

J	KOPCZYNSKA, E				KOPCZYNSKA, E			DOMINANCE OF MICROFLAGELLATES OVER DIATOMS IN THE ANTARCTIC AREAS OF DEEP VERTICAL MIXING AND KRILL CONCENTRATIONS	JOURNAL OF PLANKTON RESEARCH												Phytoplankton data obtained during six summer Polish expeditions to the Antarctic Peninsula area, are compared with concurrently recorded data on water column stabilities and krill abundance. The results show that flagellates (1.5-20-mu-m) are numerically dominant over diatoms in the areas of deep vertical mixing and/or extensive krill concentrations. Of 102 stations dominated by flagellates, 85 (83.3%) are located in a well mixed water column (>100 m) and correspond to a mean krill density of 15-346 t Nm-2. In the same areas, estimated flagellate carbon biomass exceeds diatom carbon. On the other hand, of the 40 stations dominated by diatoms, 36 (90%) are located in areas of increased water column stability (upper mixed layer of 10-50 m) and correspond to a low mean krill biomass of 0.34-4.6 t Nm-2. Positive correlations of flagellate to diatom (F:D) cell number ratios with the depth of the upper mixed layer suggest light limitation of diatom growth and an increased sinking rate of diatoms relative to flagellates in the areas of deep vertical mixing. The relationship of the F:D ratio with krill abundance suggests that krill prefer feeding on diatoms and are less efficient in grazing particles of the size of microflagellates (<20-mu-m). Flagellates exceed diatoms in an unstable water column when the phytoplankton populations are low; both algal groups increase in numbers with growing stability. The results provide field evidence that deep vertical mixing and krill grazing create conditions for the dominance of flagellates over diatoms. Both factors acting together are likely to suppress diatom blooms in the Antarctic.																	0142-7873					AUG	1992	14	8					1031	1054		10.1093/plankt/14.8.1031							WOS:A1992JH49200002

A cruise of the Southern Ocean GLOBEC program (NBP0103) in April/May 2001 permitted an evaluation of the efficacy of a high-powered strobe light (150 W) mounted on a 1-m(2) multiple opening/closing net and environmental sampling system (MOCNESS) in reducing net avoidance. Three horizontal tows were made in Laubeuf Fjord, Marguerite Bay (western Antarctic Peninsula, 67.89degreesS; 68.30 W) on 28-29 May in an area that had a high abundance of adult krill (mostly Euphausia superba, Dana and a few E. crystallorophias, Holt and Tattersall). Each tow consisted of a series of paired down and up casts through a set depth interval (e.g. 50-90 m), with each successive net (335 mum mesh) sampling both a down and up cast. The strobe light was either "on" or "off" while each net was open, and when on, the light flashed at 4-s intervals. During a tow, four of the eight nets sampled with the strobe flashing and four sampled with the strobe off, in a random sequence. Total zooplankton displacement volume was significantly higher (P<0.0 5), on average by a factor of similar to 1.5, when the strobe light was on. The increased biovolume was due to the enhanced catch (factor of similar to 2) of adult krill (15-60 mm length). There was no enhanced catch of smaller krill (5-15 mm length: a mixture of E. superba, E. crystallorophias, and Thysanoessa macrura, GO Sars). In addition, the average length of the large krill fraction was not changed substantially with the strobe light on. These results suggest that krill avoidance of nets can be overcome by intense strobe lighting.

Levels of photosynthetically active radiation 3-5 times below surface irradiance caused krill to die within a week, while animals in the dark survived. Addition of ultraviolet-B typical of depths up to 15 m were found to significantly accelerate mortality and lead to a drop in activity in all experiments. A drop in activity in krill exposed to ultraviolet-A wavelengths was evident without an increase in mortality. The protein content of animals from various treatments was found not to vary.

The study focused on scattering layers consisting mainly of krill, using a submerged echosounder to resolve individual krill at their daylight depths. Individuals. were tracked for extended periods, and the method was capable of discerning differences in TS and behaviour within seemingly homogenous scattering layers. Krill size increased with depth. This was sometimes, but not always, reflected in TS. The relationship between TS and size broke down when larger krill deeper in the water column were prone to more upward swimming than shallow-living specimens, which reduced TS, but there were also unexplained variations in TS by depth. The variability of TS within the krill tracks was generally high, with deviations routinely exceeding 10 dB, further emphasizing the dependence of krill TS on behaviour. Therefore, although measured values of TS were within the ranges previously reported for krill, it was difficult to apply fixed TS-size relationships. The study underscores the need to determine the impact of behaviour on TS, and shows that appropriate methods to do so are now available.

Krill were observed in May-June 2013 and December 2014 in 3 bays in the Western Antarctic Peninsula. Krill abundances and movement behaviors were determined from in situ image sequences collected for up to 10 min throughout the water column, up to 625 m deep; 3,345 individual krill tracks were collected. Seasonal changes in individual krill behaviors coincided with seasonal shifts in krill vertical distributions. During late spring, net upward swimming direction (0.9 +/- 2.1 degrees from horizontal) and vertical velocity (0.3 +/- 0.2 body lengths [BL] s(-1)) resulted in shallower maximum abundances of krill within the water column proximate to near-surface phytoplankton distributions. During late autumn, krill swimming patterns tended downward, including swimming direction (-5.2 +/- 0.8 degrees from horizontal) and vertical velocity (-0.1 +/- 0.0 BL s(-1)), leading to deeper distributions proximate to the benthos. Individual krill motility was greater in spring than autumn, as evidenced by an increase in swimming speeds (5.4 +/- 0.2 vs. 2.8 +/- 0.0 BL s(-1)) and turning rates (120 +/- 5 vs. 107 +/- 2 degrees s(-1)). Remarkably, krill in autumn were capable of swimming as quickly as krill in spring. These results suggest seasonal shifts in krill movement behaviors have direct ramifications for krill distributions, proximity to food sources, and impacts on biogeochemical cycling in coastal Antarctic waters.

Larvae of Euphausia crystallorophias Holt and Tattersall and Thysanoessa macrura G.O. Sars were observed in the study area every year in contrast to larvae of Euphausia superba which were absent during the entire period of sampling. Highest abundances of both species were observed during the summer of 2005 and the lowest in the summer of 2004. Larvae of E. crystallorophias dominated every year and comprised more than 80% of the total abundance of euphausiid larvae. Within species, the calyptopis stages especially calyptopis 1 of E. crystallorophias dominated compared to furcilia stages of T. macrura which were less abundant. For both species, spatio-temporal variations in abundances of developmental stages were significantly correlated to density and salinity of the deep water layer. In the case of calyptopis 3 of E. crystallorophias, spatio-temporal variations were correlated with the number of days between the end of the sea ice retreat and the sampling day and for T. macrura inversely correlated to temperature of surface water layer. These variations are discussed and related to the timing of sea ice retreat, the sea ice concentration as well as metabolic conditions of adults of both species during their spawning period.

Individual animals were suspended in front of the transducers, were only loosely constrained, had substantial freedom to move, and showed more or less random orientation. One thousand echoes were collected per animal. Orientation data were recorded on video, The acoustic data were analyzed and target strengths determined from each echo. A method was developed for estimating the three-dimensional orientation of the krill based on the video images and was applied to five of them, giving their target strengths as functions of orientation. Scattering models based on a simplified distorted-wave Born approximation (DWBA) method were developed for five animals and compared with the measurements. Both measured and modeled scattering patterns showed that 120 kHz acoustic scattering levels are highly dependent on animal orientation. Use of these scattering patterns with orientation data from shipboard studies of E. superba gave mean scattering levels approximately 12 dB lower than peak levels. These results underscore the need for better in situ behavioral data to properly interpret acoustic survey results. A generic E. superba DWBA scattering model is proposed that is scalable by animal length. With good orientation information, this model could significantly improve the precision and accuracy of krill acoustic surveys. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Phylogenetic analysis of several Antarctic and sub-Antarctic Euphausia species indicates the importance of dispersal in determining the present-day geographic distribution. Dating speciation events suggest that the formation of the Antarctic Convergence, the oceanographic barrier isolating the Southern Ocean, may have played a role in separating the ancestral Antarctic and sub-Antarctic lineages. Intraspecific data show that the Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) is characterized by weak genetic differentiation, whereas the northern krill (Meganyctiphanes norvegica) is more structured showing discrete genetic pools. This difference can be explained, at least partly, by the oceanographic conditions in the areas inhabited by the two species.

We investigated the effects of alternative food materials, hen egg yolk (HEY) and exoskeleton-free (skinned) Antarctic krill (SAK), on the growth and survival of eel larvae. We found that feed comprising whole krill including exoskeleton (WAK) containing higher levels of fluoride (37.89mgkg(-1)) was acutely toxic to eel larvae exposed to this alone. In contrast, extract from SAK containing lower concentrations of fluoride (4.25mgkg(-1)) showed no apparent adverse effects. Growth of larvae fed a mixture of SE and SAK in a feed trial of 58days [mean body weight (BW), 6.0mg] was about twofold higher than that of larvae fed a mixture of SE and WAK (3.2mg) (P<0.01). A mixture of HEY and SAK also had some dietary benefits for eel larvae, enabling them to survive for up to 58days and to grow significantly (mean BW, 2.4mg), compared with their initial weight (mean BW, 0.2mg) (P< 0.001). Although additional nutritional improvements are needed, the present results suggest that combination diet HEY and SAK may be a good alternative to SE as an effective diet for eel larvae.																	1355-557X					SEP	2013	44	10					1531	1538		10.1111/j.1365-2109.2012.03160.x							WOS:000323930400005

Increased Feeding and Nutrient Excretion of Adult Antarctic Krill, Euphausia superba, Exposed to Enhanced Carbon Dioxide (CO2)	PLOS ONE												Ocean acidification has a wide-ranging potential for impacting the physiology and metabolism of zooplankton. Sufficiently elevated CO2 concentrations can alter internal acid-base balance, compromising homeostatic regulation and disrupting internal systems ranging from oxygen transport to ion balance. We assessed feeding and nutrient excretion rates in natural populations of the keystone species Euphausia superba (Antarctic krill) by conducting a CO2 perturbation experiment at ambient and elevated atmospheric CO2 levels in January 2011 along the West Antarctic Peninsula (WAP). Under elevated CO2 conditions (similar to 672 ppm), ingestion rates of krill averaged 78 mu g C individual(-1) d(-1) and were 3.5 times higher than krill ingestion rates at ambient, present day CO2 concentrations. Additionally, rates of ammonium, phosphate, and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) excretion by krill were 1.5, 1.5, and 3.0 times higher, respectively, in the high CO2 treatment than at ambient CO2 concentrations. Excretion of urea, however, was similar to 17% lower in the high CO2 treatment, suggesting differences in catabolic processes of krill between treatments. Activities of key metabolic enzymes, malate dehydrogenase (MDH) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), were consistently higher in the high CO2 treatment. The observed shifts in metabolism are consistent with increased physiological costs associated with regulating internal acid-base equilibria. This represents an additional stress that may hamper growth and reproduction, which would negatively impact an already declining krill population along the WAP.				schofield, oscar/H-4169-2018	schofield, oscar/0000-0003-2359-4131												1932-6203					DEC 26	2012	7	12							e52224	10.1371/journal.pone.0052224							WOS:000313618800060	23300621

The recovery of these populations will be affected by the availability of krill, a major dietary component, in the Southern Ocean. We combine a novel energetics model for baleen whales with a state dependent foraging model to explore the impacts of an expanding krill fishery on baleen whales. We parameterize the model for blue whales, but with simple modifications it could be applied to most baleen whales. We predict that an expanding fishery will have a small but significant impact on the blue whale population through decreased birth rates. However, spreading the catch limit throughout the range of krill can reduce these effects. In addition, whales may be able to reduce these impacts through adaptive changes in foraging behavior. The relationship between krill abundance and blue whale foraging and reproductive success is nonlinear, such that larger reductions in krill biomass, potentially following a loss of sea ice due to climate change, could have a much larger negative impact on the recovery of blue whales.

Comparison of the structure and function of Southern Ocean regional ecosystems: The Antarctic Peninsula and South Georgia	JOURNAL OF MARINE SYSTEMS												The ocean ecosystems around the west Antarctic Peninsula and South Georgia are two of the best described regional ecosystems of the Southern Ocean. They therefore provide a useful basis for developing comparative analyses of ocean ecosystems around the Antarctic. There are clear and expected differences in seasonality and species composition between the two ecosystems, but these mask an underlying similarity in ecosystem structure and function. This similarity results from the two ecosystems being part of a continuum, from more ice covered regions in the south to open water regions in the north. Within this continuum the major factors affecting ecosystem structure and function are the sea ice, the biogeochemical conditions and the connectivity generated by the flow of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current. Antarctic krill are central to the food web in both ecosystems, but the other species of plankton and predators present are different. These different species provide alternative pathways of energy transfer from primary production to the highest trophic levels. The relative dominance of these species can provide indicators of change in ecosystem structure and function. Both ecosystems are changing as a result of physically and biologically driven processes, and the ecological responses being observed are complex and variable across different species and within the two regions. Species in parts of the northern Antarctic Peninsula are being replaced by species that currently dominate farther north in more oceanic areas such as at South Georgia. The similarity of structure and strong connectivity, mean that projections of future change will require generic models of these ecosystems that can encompass changes in structure and function within a connected continuum from ice covered to open water in winter.

Here, we show for the first time the occurrence of VMS in soils, vegetation, phytoplankton, and krill samples from the Antarctic Peninsula region, which questions previous claims that these compounds are flyers and do not significantly reach remote ecosystems. Cyclic VMS are the predominant compounds, with concentrations ranging from the limits of detection to 110 ng/g in soils. Concentrations of cyclic VMS in phytoplankton are negatively correlated with sea surface salinity, indicating a source from ice and snow melting and consistent with snow depositional inputs. After the summer snow melting, VMS accumulate in the Southern Ocean and Antarctic biota. Therefore, once introduced into the marine environment, VMS are eventually trapped by the biological pump and, thus, behave as single hoppers. Conversely, VMS in soils and vegetation behave as multiple hoppers due to their high volatility.

Abundance and grazing impacts of krill, salps and copepods along the 140 degrees E meridian in the Southern Ocean during summer	ANTARCTIC SCIENCE												Abundance and grazing impacts of krill, salps and herbivorous copepods were investigated in Antarctic waters along the 140 degrees E meridian, south of Australia, during the summers of 2002 and 2003. North of the Southern Boundary of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (SB-ACC), macrozooplankton comprised species of Salpa thompsoni and large herbivorous copepods, while the area south of the SBACC was numerically dominated by Euphausia superba or E. crystallorophias. North of the SB-ACC, the estimate of grazing impact revealed that krill, salps and copepods, Calanoides acutus, Calanus propinquus, Rhincalanus gigas and Metridia gerlachei, are able to remove a maximum of 37% of the total phytoplankton standing stock in early to midsummer, but grazing is negligible in late summer. The high grazing impact is attributed to the relatively high zooplankton abundance and low phytoplankton abundance. South of the SB-ACC, overall daily grazing impact of the three zooplankton groups was low and did not exceed 6% of the total phytoplankton standing stock throughout the investigation period. Present results indicate that the contribution of krill, salps and copepods varies seasonally as well as regionally across the SB-ACC. It seems that the carbon transport from surface to deep water by macro- and mesozooplankton in summer in this area is relatively large north of the SB-ACC but small south of the SB-ACC.

Krill (Euphausia superba) distribution contracts southward during rapid regional warming	NATURE CLIMATE CHANGE												High-latitude ecosystems are among the fastest warming on the planet(1). Polar species may be sensitive to warming and ice loss, but data are scarce and evidence is conflicting(2-4). Here, we show that, within their main population centre in the southwest Atlantic sector, the distribution of Euphausia superba (hereafter, 'krill') has contracted southward over the past 90 years. Near their northern limit, numerical densities have declined sharply and the population has become more concentrated towards the Antarctic shelves. A concomitant increase in mean body length reflects reduced recruitment of juvenile krill. We found evidence for environmental controls on recruitment, including a reduced density of juveniles following positive anomalies of the Southern Annular Mode. Such anomalies are associated with warm, windy and cloudy weather and reduced sea ice, all of which may hinder egg production and the survival of larval krill(5). However, the total post-larval density has declined less steeply than the density of recruits, suggesting that survival rates of older krill have increased. The changing distribution is already perturbing the krill-centred food web(6) and may affect biogeochemical cycling(7,8). Rapid climate change, with associated nonlinear adjustments in the roles of keystone species, poses challenges for the management of valuable polar ecosystems(3).

The krill powder inclusion in the test diet was 9.67% (w/w). There were no differences noted in body weight or food consumption in either gender. Differences in clinical chemistry values were noted in the krill powder-treated animals, but these findings were of no toxicological significance. A significant decrease in absolute heart weight, but not relative heart weight, was observed in both sexes given krill powder, although no corresponding histological changes were observed. Hepatocyte vacuolation was noted histologically in males fed krill powder. This finding was not associated with other indications of hepatic dysfunction. The no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) for the conditions of this study was considered to be 9.67% krill powder. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Published data are scarce and are usually acquired with single camera systems that provide suboptimal control over the measurement accuracy. Here, we describe a stereo photo camera application for accurate krill measurements in situ, based on several Euphausia superba and Meganyctiphanes norvegica datasets. Body tilt orientation, body length, and school volume density from scattered and schooling krill are presented. Some challenges to the practical implementation of the method are discussed, including practical limits on krill body yaw angles for obtaining useful measurement accuracy and how to account accurately for the true vertical. Calibration and measurement accuracy is discussed together with a practical definition of krill body orientation. Krill sizes determined from stereo images are compared with those measured from trawl samples. The krill body tilt measurements yielded mean estimates of positive (head-up) or negative tilt of 9-17 degrees with rather large spread for scattered aggregations of M. norvegica (SD = 30-37 degrees) and about half of that for polarized schools of E. superba (SD = 14-17 degrees). The measured krill body orientation distributions were also used to calculate krill acoustic target strength as predicted by the stochastic distorted wave Born approximation (SDWBA) model.

Swarm characteristics of Antarctic krill Euphausia superba relative to the proximity of land during summer in the Scotia Sea	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												We studied the relationship between the proximity of land and the distribution and swarming characteristics of Antarctic krill across the Scotia Sea in January and February 2003. Krill swarms identified with a Simrad EK60 (38 kHz, 120 kHz) echosounder were grouped into 4 categories according to distance from shoreline: 0 to 50 km, 50 to 100 km, 100 to 200 km and >200 km. Cross-sectional areas of swarms were significantly larger inshore, with a mean value of 120 m(2) in the 0 to 50 km zone compared to < 80 m(2) further offshore. The packing concentration of krill within inshore swarms was also significantly greater, with an average density of 95 ind. m(-3) compared to between 24 and 31 ind. m(-3) elsewhere. A large proportion of the biomass was concentrated into a small number of large, dense swarms throughout the survey area, and this trend increased with decreasing distance from shore. The highest median number of swarms per km and krill acoustic biomass per km was found in the 50 to 100 km zone. However, a significantly greater number of large, biomass-rich swarms occurred in the 0 to 50 km zone compared to all other zones. Swarms in the 0 to 50 km zone were also significantly further apart. The majority of swarms were located in the upper 50 m during the daytime although they were marginally deeper in the night in offshore regions. Krill are likely to move between inshore and offshore environments continuously over their lifetimes. The change in krill behaviour between environments could be a response to local predatory threats over short spatial and temporal scales.

CCAMLR SCIENCE												This paper explains the management of the Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) fishery in the Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean, and current knowledge about the state of the regional krill stock. In this region, krill fishing is permitted in an area of approximately 3.5 million km(2) which is divided into four subareas (labelled Subareas 48.1 to 48.4) for management and reporting purposes. The effective regional catch limit (or 'trigger level'), established in 1991, is 0.62 million tonnes year(-1), equivalent to similar to 1% of the regional biomass estimated in 2000. Each subarea has also had its own catch limit, between 0.093 and 0.279 million tonnes year(-1), since 2009. There is some evidence fora decline in the abundance of krill in the 1980s, but no evidence of a further decline in recent decades. Local-scale monitoring programs have been established in three of the subareas to monitor krill biomass in survey grids covering between 10 000 and 125 000 km(2). Cautious extrapolation from these local monitoring programs provides conservative estimates of the regional biomass in recent years. This suggests that fishing at the trigger level would be equivalent to a long-term exploitation rate (annual catch divided by biomass) of <7%, which is below the 9.3% level considered appropriate to maintain the krill stock and support krill predators. Subarea catch limits exceed 9.3% of conservatively estimated subarea biomass in up to 20% of years due to high variability in krill biomass indices. The actual exploitation rate in each subarea has remained <3% because annual catches have been <50% of the trigger level since 1991. Comparison with the 9.3% reference exploitation rate suggests that current management is precautionary at the regional scale. The subarea catch limits help prevent excessive concentration of catch at the subarea scale. Finer-scale management might be necessary to manage the risk of adverse impacts which might occur as a result of concentrated fishing in sensitive areas or climate change. Frequent assessment of the krill stock will enhance CCAMLR's ability to manage these risks. Continuing the local monitoring programs will provide valuable information on krill variability, but more information is required on how the monitored biomass relates to biomass at the subarea and regional scales.

J	Xue, M; Zhu, GP				Xue, Mei; Zhu, Guoping			Variation in fatty acids of Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) preserved under constant dry conditions: Does storage time and ontogeny matter?	JOURNAL OF FOOD PROCESSING AND PRESERVATION												As a key species in the Antarctic food web, Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) is a potentially healthy source of lipids, containing two of the most important omega 3 fatty acids. However, the degree of unsaturation of long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids, especially those from the omega 3 family, makes dry samples of the species vulnerable to oxidative degradation during long-term storage. The ontogenetic and temporal variation in fatty acids of dry krill tissues preserved under ambient temperature is unclear. To investigate the effects of long-term storage at ambient temperatures on degradation of fatty acids in krill, variation in the fatty acid composition of dried tissues at 0, 4, and 8 months was investigated. The results showed that storage time had a significant effect on fatty acid composition. When preserved for up to 4 months, the fatty acid content of krill changed dramatically, after which the proportion of fatty acids stabilized. Sensitivity to oxidation varied with the type of fatty acid, and krill size had an effect on the antioxidant capacity of fatty acids. Novelty impact statement The ontogenetic and temporal variation in fatty acids of dry Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) tissues preserved under ambient temperature was investigated. Storage time had a significant effect on fatty acid composition for long-term storage of dried krill tissue preserved at a constant temperature. Krill size affected the degree of fatty acid oxidation and larger individuals lost more polyunsaturated fatty acids in the long term (8 months). Four months is a valuable reference for studying the effects of storage time on fatty acid degradation of krill tissue to maximize its nutritional value.																	0145-8892	1745-4549				APR	2021	45	4							e15357	10.1111/jfpp.15357		FEB 2021					WOS:000621509600001						
J	Croxall, JP; Prince, PA; Reid, K				Croxall, JP; Prince, PA; Reid, K			Dietary segregation of krill-eating south Georgia seabirds	JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY												The diets of six of the main seabird species (two petrels, two albatrosses, two penguins) breeding at Bird Island, South Georgia were studied simultaneously during the chick-rearing period in 1986. For five species, Antarctic krill Euphausia superba was the main food (39-98% by mass); grey-headed albatrosses took mainly the ommastrephid squid Martialia hyadesi (71%) and only 16% krill. The size of the krill taken was similar between seabird species, although there were small but significant differences between penguins and the other species. Sex and reproductive status of krill, however, was different between all seabird species, reflecting some combination of differences in foraging ranges, selectivity by predators, or differences in escape responses of krill. For the krill-eating species, the rest of the diet varied substantially between species, comprising Martialia and nototheniid fish (black browed albatross and, along with lanternfish, white-chinned petrel), lanternfish and amphipods (Antarctic prion and macaroni penguin), and icefish (gentoo penguin). Long-term data on breeding success and information on diet in 5-10 other years suggest that in 1986 seabird diet and reproductive performance was indicative of a year of good availability of krill around South Georgia. In such circumstances, ecological segregation between krill-eating species appears to be maintained chiefly by differences in foraging range and feeding methods, which are reviewed. This situation is rather different from the few studies of seabird communities elsewhere, where prey type and size are believed to be the main mechanisms of dietary segregation.

To this end, instantaneous growth rate experiments were conducted with larval and juvenile krill to determine growth increments and molting frequency in situ. All experiments were carried out during fall and winter months (April through September) on nine separate cruises west of the Antarctic Peninsula between 1987 and 1999. A consistent seasonal pattern across years was observed: growth rates decreased during fall (April/May), were minimal in early winter (June), and increased to maximum rates by late winter (September). Habitat-specific differences (water column vs under-ice) in growth rates of larvae collected on the same cruise were not observed in early winter (June 1993; within-year comparison). However, in a between-year comparison, larvae from the under-ice habitat (June/July 1987) had significantly higher growth increments than larvae from the open-water habitat (July 1989). The difference between these two comparisons may be a function of the degree of contrast in food availability in the water column and the sea ice at different times in the winter. Daylength at the time of collection explained 74% of the variation in larval and juvenile growth rates. This correlation may be an indirect effect of the influence of diel cycles on krill behavior and/or primary production in both the water column and ice.																	0025-3162					NOV	2003	143	5					833	843		10.1007/s00227-003-1130-8							WOS:000186463800001

A 56% FM-based diet was regarded as a high FM inclusion diet (HFM), and a low-FM diet (LFM) was prepared by replacing 50% FM from the HFM. Four other diets were prepared by supplementing 3%, 6%, 9% and 12% KM into the LFM diet gradually replacing soy protein concentrate and tankage meal (designated as KM3, KM6, KM9 and KM12 respectively). Quadruplicate groups of fish were fed one of the diets for 12 weeks. The growth performance and feed utilization efficiency were improved by the dietary KM supplementation. Digestibility of dietary protein and dry matter was increased by the KM3-9 diets. Haematocrit and haemoglobin were increased by KM supplementation. The innate immunity and antioxidant capacity assessed by Ig, antiprotease, lysozyme, GPx and SOD and the condition factor of fish were significantly increased by KM3-9 diets. Moreover, goblet cell counts, villi length and fillet yield of fish were significantly improved by all the KM-containing diets (KM3-12). A 25-day-long challenge test with the Edwardsiella tarda pathogen showed that the cumulative mortality was higher in fish fed the LFM diet than in fish fed the HFM or KM-supplemented diets. The results indicate that dietary KM supplementation in a LFM diet can increase growth performance and feed utilization efficiency, diet digestibility, intestinal development and functions, innate immunity and disease resistance of olive flounder. The recommended level of KM inclusion in a LFM diet seems to be 6.6% according to quadratic regression analysis.

In this study, the effects of processing methods on the content, structural isomers, and composition of astaxanthins (free astaxanthin and astaxanthin esters) were studied. Three drying methods, comprising freeze-drying, microwave drying, and hot-air drying, were used. Free astaxanthin (Ast), astaxanthin monoesters (AM), and astaxanthin diesters (AD) in boiled krill (control) and dried krill were extracted and analyzed using high-resolution mass spectrometry with ultraviolet detection. After the three processes, total astaxanthin loss ranged from 8.6 to 64.9%, and the AM and AD contents ranged from 78.3 to 16.6 and 168.7 to 90.5 mu g/g, respectively. Compared to other kinds of astaxanthin esters, astaxanthin esters, which linked to eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid, as well as the Ast, were more easily degraded, and AM was more susceptible to degradation than AD. All-E-astaxanthin easily transformed to the 13Z-astaxanthin than to the 9Z-astaxanthin during the drying process, but the proportions of optical isomers changed due to drying by no more than 5%. The results suggested that freeze-drying, low-power microwave drying (<= 1 kW), and low-temperature hot-air drying (<= 60 degrees C) are optimal drying methods for ensuring the quality of krill products.					cong, xinyuancong/0000-0002-6665-0335												2470-1343					NOV 5	2019	4	19					17972	17980		10.1021/acsomega.9b01294							WOS:000495089100005	31720501

Small crustaceans are regarded as being less motile than most fish species. Crustaceans also display low levels of active avoidance from trawl netting, which in turn may cause direct contact with netting on multiple occasions on their passage towards the codend increasing the probability for escapement. Full-scaled experiments to estimate gear selectivity are highly resource demanding and are highly technically challenging for several types of fisheries. In this study, we developed and tested a trawl-independent towed-rig construction designed to investigate size selectivity of Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba). The results indicate that valid selectivity estimates can be obtained using this method, but due to the small sample size, results are inconclusive. However, the findings of the current study show a potential for developing easier and more cost-effective ways of investigating and estimating size selectivity of Antarctic krill and other small crustacean species in trawls.

In this study, 1-octacosanol was extracted from Antarctic krill for the first time. Separation of 1-octacosanol was achieved using high-performance thin-layer chromatography (TLC) with a mobile phase consisting of petroleum ether/ethyl acetate/toluene (4 : 1 : 0.05, v/v/v) on precoated silica gel GF(254) high-performance TLC plates. The separated 1-octacosanol was quantified using spectrodensitometry with distilled water/bromothymol blue/sodium hydroxide (100 : 0.1 : 0.7, v/w/w) as a chromogenic system. The high-performance TLC method was validated with respect to specificity, linearity, intra-and interplate variation. The stability of the 1-octacosanol-chromogen complex and recovery of 1-octacosanol were also evaluated. Containing similar to 10.6 mg/mg 1-octacosanol, Antarctic krill is potentially a rich and renewable source of 1-octacosanol.																	0021-9665	1945-239X				MAY-JUN	2015	53	5					811	815		10.1093/chromsci/bmu098							WOS:000360833600025	25146498

Significant changes in all variables were encountered. Total ash, lipid, calcium, magnesium and strontium all increased in concentration following moulting. Water, protein and copper concentrations all decreased following ecdysis and increased again towards the end of the moult cycle. The major ions sodium and potassium fluctuated around mean levels. Cast moults of E. superba were shown to be a drain on the ionic load of the krill, and the losses inherent in exuviation could account for much of the variation observed during the moult cycle.																	0025-3162					JUN	1992	113	2					201	209									WOS:A1992JA91100004

Here, we quantify the changing circumpolar distributions of Antarctic krill, based on the CHINARE 2013/14 circum-Antarctic expedition, plus independent analyses of compiled abundance data (KRILLBASE: 1926-2016). In the 1920s-1930s, average krill densities in the Atlantic-Bellingshausen sector were eight times those in the other sectors. More recently, however, the concentration factor has dropped to only about twofold. This reflects a rebalancing broadly commensurate with climatic forcing: krill densities declined in the Atlantic-Bellingshausen sector which has warmed and lost sea ice, densities may have increased in the Ross-Pacific sector which showed the opposite climatic trend, while densities showed no significant changes in the more stable Lazarev-Indian sectors. Such changes would impact circumpolar food webs, so to better define these we examined circumpolar trends of isotopic values in krill and other zooplankton based on the CHINARE cruise and a literature meta-analysis. Krill delta N-15 values ranged significantly between sectors from 2.21 parts per thousand (Indian) to 3.59 parts per thousand (Ross-Pacific), about half a trophic level lower than another key euphausiid,Thysanoessa macrura. These isoscapes form a baseline for interpreting the reliance of predators on euphausiids, within the varying food webs around the continent. Overall, we suggest that the Indo-Pacific sector has acted as a refuge for the circumpolar krill stock while conditions for them deteriorated rapidly in the Atlantic sector.

Managing fishery development in sensitive ecosystems: identifying penguin habitat use to direct management in Antarctica	ECOSPHERE												In the Southern Ocean, the at-sea distributions of most predators of Antarctic krill are poorly known, primarily because tracking studies have only been undertaken on a restricted set of species, and then only at a limited number of sites. For chinstrap penguins, one of the most abundant krill predators breeding across the Antarctic Peninsula, we show that habitat models developed utilizing the distance from the colony and the bearing to the shelf-edge, adjusting for the at-sea density of Pygoscelis penguins from other colonies, can be used to predict, with a high level of confidence, the at-sea distribution of chinstrap penguins from untracked colonies during the breeding season. Comparison of predicted penguin distributions with outputs from a high-resolution oceanographic model shows that chinstrap penguins prefer nearshore habitats, over shallow bathymetry, with slow-flowing waters, but that they sometimes also travel to areas beyond the edge of the continental shelf where the faster-flowing waters of the Coastal Current or the fronts of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current occur. In the slow-moving shelf waters, large penguin colonies may lead to krill depletion during incubation and chick-rearing periods when penguins are acting as central place foragers. The habitats used by chinstrap penguins are also locations preferentially used by the commercial krill fishery, one of the last under-developed marine capture fisheries anywhere on the planet. As it develops, this fishery has the potential to compete with chinstrap penguins and other natural krill predators. Scaling our habitat models by chinstrap penguin population data demonstrates where overlap with the fishery is likely to be most important. Our results suggest that a better understanding of krill retention and krill depletion in areas used by natural predators and by the krill fishery are needed, and that risk management strategies for the fishery should include assessment of how krill movement can satisfy the demands of both natural predators and the fishery across a range of spatial and temporal scales. Such information will help regional management authorities better understand how plausible ecosystem-based management frameworks could be developed to ensure sustainable co-existence of the fishery and competing natural predators.

Effect of a carnivorous diet on the lipids, fatty acids and condition of Antarctic krill, Euphausia superba	ANTARCTIC SCIENCE					9th Scar International Biology Symposium	JUL 25-29, 2005	Curitiba, BRAZIL					Krill are thought to be predominantly herbivorous, but a heterotrophic diet might be crucial for their growth and survival. To compare the influence of herbivory and carnivory on krill we conducted a nine month feeding trial. We examined lipid composition of the hepatopancreas, abdomen and remaining body portions of krill fed diatoms at bloom condition levels, and diatoms with the addition of pellets or minced clam meat to simulate a partly carnivorous diet. Mortality, dry mass and lipid content were similar among treatments. We examined lipid class and fatty acid profiles, with emphasis placed on the ratio of storage (triacylglycerol) to structural (polar lipid) lipid and key essential omega 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids: 20:5 omega 3 and 22:6 omega 3. The triacylglycerol : polar lipid ratio increased in krill fed on the mixed diet as did the 20:5 omega 3 : 22:6 omega 3 ratio. Overall these findings indicate that provision of clam in the diet improved krill condition, and further suggest that carnivory may aid krill growth in the wild under certain environmental conditions.

A Bayesian hierarchical model of Antarctic fur seal foraging and pup growth related to sea ice and prey abundance	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS												We created a Bayesian hierarchical model (BHM) to investigate ecosystem relationships between the physical ecosystem (sea ice extent), a prey measure (krill density), predator behaviors (diving and foraging effort of female Antarctic fur seals, Arctocephalus gazella, with pups) and predator characteristics (mass of maternal fur seals and pups). We collected data on Antarctic fur seals from 1987/1988 to 1994/1995 at Seal Island, Antarctica. The BHM allowed us to link together predators and prey into a model that uses all the data efficiently and accounts for major sources of uncertainty. Based on the literature, we made hypotheses about the relationships in the model, which we compared with the model outcome after fitting the BHM. For each BHM parameter, we calculated the mean of the posterior density and the 95% credible interval. Our model confirmed others' findings that increased sea ice was related to increased krill density. Higher krill density led to reduced dive intensity of maternal fur seals, as measured by dive depth and duration, and to less time spent foraging by maternal fur seals. Heavier maternal fur seals and lower maternal foraging effort resulted in heavier pups at 22 d. No relationship was found between krill density and maternal mass, or between maternal mass and foraging effort on pup growth rates between 22 and 85 days of age. Maternal mass may have reflected environmental conditions prior to the pup provisioning season, rather than summer prey densities. Maternal mass and foraging effort were not related to pup growth rates between 22 and 85 d, possibly indicating that food was not limiting, food sources other than krill were being used, or differences occurred before pups. reached age 22 d.

The use of fishing vessels to provide acoustic data on the distribution and abundance of Antarctic krill and other pelagic species	FISHERIES RESEARCH												A fishery for Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) has existed for over 3 decades and the Commission for Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR) manages this fishery using precautionary catch limits, fishery data collection and a scientific observer programme operating on the fishing vessels. A recent increase in the number of vessels fishing and the rising costs of undertaking scientific research cruises have focussed attention on being able to use fishing vessels to collect more extensive scientific data sets. In 2011, CCAMLR's Subgroup on Acoustic Survey and Analysis Methods (SG-ASAM) was tasked with assessing the use of acoustic data collected from fishing vessels to provide qualitative and quantitative information on the distribution and relative abundance of Antarctic krill and other pelagic species. SG-ASAM conceived a proof of concept programme and implemented the first stage in 2013 to determine the current setup of acoustic equipment on participating fishing vessels and to establish whether these vessels could collect geo- and time-referenced acoustic data. To date data have been received from 7 krill fishing vessels and SG-ASAM has now focussed on the development of data collection protocols to enable fishing vessels to collect quantitative acoustic data along prescribed transects. While this development work continues, the willingness of fishing industry to participate in such studies has already been demonstrated by several fishing companies, and Norwegian- and Chinese-flagged fishing vessels are undertaking krill biomass surveys in two key fishery Areas in the South Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean.

The study investigates the neuroprotective effects of krill oil (KO) on the cuprizone (CPZ)-induced demyelination of the MS mouse model. The results suggested that KO treatment can improve the motor abnormalities and cognitive deficit of MS mice, as demonstrated by the open field, rotarod and Morris water maze tests. Meanwhile, the CPZ-induced demyelination of mice was alleviated after KO treatment and KO can attenuate the CPZ-induced oxidative stress. Furthermore, KO reduces M1 microglia activation and promotes M2 microglia polarization in the corpus callosum. Moreover, our studies indicated that KO diminished histone deacetylase (HDAC)3, phosphorylated signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) 3 and NF-kappa B p65 protein expression levels. In conclusion, KO exerts its neuroprotective actions in mice with CPZ-induced demyelination possibly by modulating the HDAC3/STAT3/NF-kappa B signaling pathways.																	1756-4646	2214-9414				JAN	2021	76								104309	10.1016/j.jff.2020.104309							WOS:000606642200009

Hence, the thermal and saline tolerance of krill were examined under in-situ aquarium conditions with different controlled scenarios. According to the experiments, the critical lethal times of krill were 24 h, 2 h and 0.5 h under 9 degrees C, 12 degrees C, and 15 degrees C, respectively, and the estimated 50% lethal times were about 17.1 h and 1.7 h under 12 degrees C and 15 degrees C, respectively. Additionally, the critical lethal times (the estimated 50% lethal times) of krill were approximately 14 h and 0.5 h (about 22.9 h and 1.7 h) of salinity under 19.7 and 15.9, respectively. The observed critical and 50% lethal times of krill were 0.5 h and approximately 1.4 h, respectively, salinity under 55.2. The critical and 50% lethal temperatures of krill were 13 degrees C and approximately 14.2 degrees C, respectively. Additionally, the critical and 50% lethal salinity was 19.6 and approximately 17.5 for the lower saline (below normal oceanic salinity [34.4]) environment and 50.3 and approximately 53.2 for the higher saline (above 34.4) environment, respectively. The upper thermal and saline preferences of krill can be considered 6 degrees C and 26.8 to 41.2, respectively. These results can provide potential scenarios for predicting the possible fate of this key species in the Southern Ocean.

The analysis has addressed the problems of whether krill swarms in a small area may be of a limited number of types, and whether the biological characteristics of the krill could be related to the echo-sounder measurements of the swarm. The main sources of biological variation between krill in different swarms seemed to be related to size and maturity. Krill swarms did not appear to form groups based on biological similarity, and swarms caught in the same haul were as different as swarms caught in different hauls. However, swarms could be divided into groups on the basis of time of day and swarm depth. The biological features (size, maturity, sex ratio and moult stage) of krill in the swarms were not related to echo-sounder observations (horizontal and vertical extent, depth and density of swarms), although some degree of separation between swarms containing large and small krill may be possible if the shape of the swarms is considered. Information on biological characteristics of krill in swarms must still be collected using nets.																	0198-0149					FEB	1992	39	2A					359	&		10.1016/0198-0149(92)90113-8							WOS:A1992HH58600015

Effects of low crude oil chronic exposure on the northern krill (Meganyctiphanes norvegica)	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY												Chronic oil pollution related to gas and oil drilling activities is increasing in the sea due to the rising offshore petroleum industry activity. Among marine organisms, zooplankton play a crucial role in the marine ecosystem and therefore understanding the effects of crude oil chronic exposure on zooplankton is needed to determine the impact of oil in marine environments. The present study reports on the effect of crude oil on adult northern krill, Meganyctiphanes norvegica, collected during three seasons. Their sensitivity to oil was examined with oil concentration of 0.01 versus 0.1 mg oil L-1 and photo-modified oil in flowing seawater maintained in the dark for 2 weeks at in situ temperature. Oil (polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, PAHs) entered the krill (on average, 350 and 4400 mu g.kg(-1) wet weight in low and medium oil treatments respectively) and a larger fraction of the krill exhibited digestive gland pathologies (enhanced apoptosis and pathology of digestive tubules) in oil treatments (27-80%) compared to a significantly lower fraction (7-13%) in treatments that received no oil. However, 2-week oil exposure at these concentrations did not significantly decrease survivorship or impair basic functioning such as feeding and respiration rates. Similarly, there were only limited changes in the transcription of 7 selected genes from head tissue. Additionally, although there was significant seasonal variation in krill total lipid content and fatty acid composition, there was no treatment effect on both these parameters, which suggests limited oxidative stress under experimental conditions. Furthermore, there was no significant treatment effect on two direct measures of oxidative stress (MDA: malondialdehyde and AOPP: advanced oxidation protein products) in any of the seasons. Nevertheless, histology clearly revealed enhanced digestive gland pathologies in krill even at low concentrations. Although krill with such pathologies continue to survive, their accumulation of PAHs may be transferred up the food chain, impacting their predators and the wider ecosystem.				moodley, leon/AAH-1674-2019	Bechmann, Renee Katrin/0000-0002-7113-4386; Moodley, Leon/0000-0002-0617-3514												0022-0981	1879-1697				MAR	2018	500						120	131		10.1016/j.jembe.2017.07.003							WOS:000426230500014						
J	Karlsen, O; Suontama, J; Olsen, RE				Karlsen, Orjan; Suontama, Jorma; Olsen, Rolf Erik			Effect of Antarctic krillmeal on quality of farmed Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua L.)	AQUACULTURE RESEARCH												Farmed Atlantic cod with a mean weight of 4.8 kg were maintained for 9 weeks in sea cages and fed diets where the dietary fishmeal component was substituted with increasing proportions (0%, 22%, 63% and 100%) of meal from Antarctic krill, Euphausia superba. Wild-caught cod were included in the study as external control. At termination of feeding, all fish were slaughtered and muscle pH was immediately recorded. The fish were then stored on ice for three days and assessed for muscle pH and objective (skin and fillet colour, and fillet texture) and subjective (sensory evaluation) quality criteria. Replacement of fishmeal with krillmeal in the diets resulted in the skin colour above and below the lateral line to be more red than the control group without krillmeal substitutions, even though this difference was not significant, and with more yellow hue. Additions of krillmeal increased the muscle whiteness and yellow hue compared with the control group and wild fish. There was no difference in red hue between the groups. Muscle pH, texture or sensory attributes were unaffected by dietary inclusion level of krillmeal. Wild-caught cod deviated in several aspects from the farmed cod. It is concluded that the replacement of fishmeal with Antarctic krillmeal in the diets two months before slaughter did not move the sensory attributes more towards wild fish.

POLAR BIOLOGY												This study presents data on krill demography west of the Antarctic Peninsula covering many years since 1982. The recruitment indices are compared with those for other mesoscale study regions collected over the last 25 years. We use these data to investigate whether results from such mesoscale surveys are representative of large-scale stocks or regional populations. Generally, the proportional recruitment indices for 1- (R-1) and 2-year-old (R-2) krill differ substantially between years for a given area. However, indices were in conformity with the results from other regional scientific surveys. Recruitment indices showed a significant correlation for age-class 1 krill between scientific surveys from the northern Bellingshausen Sea, the Elephant Island area and South Georgia. The correlation becomes weaker for R-2 recruitment indices. There was no correlation between krill recruitment indices from Atlantic and Indian Ocean survey sites. Problems of single-year outliers from Elephant Island are discussed, as well as the problem of 'undersized' length classes of the age-1 group that occur in the samples of some years.																	0722-4060					OCT	2003	26	10					672	679		10.1007/s00300-003-0537-5							WOS:000185917700007

This pattern implies high potential for differentiation in benthic shelf species with limited dispersal, yet consequences for pelagic organisms are less clear. The present study investigates levels of genetic variation and population structure of the Antarctic krill Euphausia superba using mitochondrial DNA and EST-linked microsatellite markers for an unprecedentedly comprehensive sampling of its populations over a circum-Antarctic range. Results: MtDNA (ND1) sequences and EST-linked microsatellite markers indicated no clear sign of genetic structure among populations over large geographic scales, despite considerable power to detect differences inferred from forward-time simulations. Based on ND1, few instances of genetic heterogeneity, not significant after correction for multiple tests, were detected between geographic or temporal samples. Neutrality tests and mismatch distribution based on mtDNA sequences revealed strong evidence of past population expansion. Significant positive values of the parameter g (a measure of population growth) were obtained from microsatellite markers using a coalescent-based genealogical method and suggested a recent start (60 000 - 40 000 years ago) for the expansion. Conclusions: The results provide evidence of lack of genetic heterogeneity of Antarctic krill at large geographic scales and unequivocal support for recent population expansion. Lack of genetic structuring likely reflects the tight link between krill and circum-Antarctic ocean currents and is consistent with the hypothesis that differentiation processes in Antarctic species are largely influenced by dispersal potential, whereas small-scale spatial and temporal differentiation might be due to local conditions leading to genetic patchiness. The signal of recent population growth suggests differential impact of glacial cycles on pelagic Antarctic species, which experienced population expansion during glaciations with increased available habitat, versus sedentary benthic shelf species. EST-linked microsatellites provide new perspectives to complement the results based on mtDNA and suggest that data-mining of EST libraries will be a useful approach to facilitate use of microsatellites for additional species.

However, this approach is not appropriate for assessing temporal variability. The size of krill in the diet of Antarctic fur seals (Arctocephalus gazella) has been shown to provide a good representation of the temporal changes in the krill population structure from within their foraging area. At Cape Shirreff, South Shetland Islands, krill in nets had modal size classes of 46-48 mm and 52-54 mm in length and appeared to reflect the presence of larger krill offshore and smaller krill inshore; krill in the diet of fur seals contained both modes, indicating that the foraging area of fur seals integrated the spatial variability in the krill population. At Signy Island, South Orkney Islands, krill in nets and fur seal diets had a modal size class of 52 mm when sampled simultaneously; however, krill in the diet of seals showed a decline in size later in the season with an overall mode of 48 mm. At Bird Island, South Georgia, there was little overlap between net samples, with a modal size class of 30-40 mm, and fur seal diets, with distinct modes of 44 and 54 mm; and there was also much greater spatial variability in the size of krill in these net samples than in those from the other two locations. Extending the comparison of krill size in the diet of seals, to include spatially congruent net samples collected immediately prior to the CCAMLR 2000 Survey, showed almost complete overlap and indicated an even greater spatial variability in the krill population structure at South Georgia. Interactions between the oceanographic transport and enhanced growth rates of krill at South Georgia may combine to produce a higher degree of spatial variability in the krill population compared to other locations and this may limit the use of differences in krill length as an indicator of their provenance. This study underlines the importance of using data from multiple sources when considering large-scale krill population dynamics; information that is crucial to the effective management of the commercial exploitation of krill.

Nico			Chinstrap and macaroni penguin diet and demography at Nyroysa, Bouvetoya	ANTARCTIC SCIENCE												Knowledge regarding interactions between predators and their prey is fundamental for understanding underlying links between climate change and ecosystem responses, including predator demographics, in the Southern Ocean. This study reports data on reproductive performance, total population size and diet composition for macaroni and chinstrap penguins breeding at Nyroysa on Bouvetoya during the summers of 1996-97, 1998-99, 2000-01 and 2007-08. The breeding populations of these two species at Nyroysa decreased significantly over the study period, with an 80% decline for chinstraps and a 50% decline for macaroni penguins, despite relatively high levels of chick production. During this period macaroni penguins at this site ate a diverse diet, dominated by myctophid fish and two krill species, whereas chinstrap penguins were Antarctic krill specialists. The population changes are probably primarily due to the expanding Antarctic fur seal population, and also to landslides that are the result of increased melting on the island which have destroyed penguin breeding sites. Additional impacts from global warming of the ocean might also be playing a role and could exacerbate the decline in these penguin populations if krill and other prey are negatively impacted in the future in this region. The local chinstrap penguin population would probably be most heavily affected given its narrow feeding niche and small current population size.

The overall distributional patterns of different sizes and maturity stages demonstrated a seasonal progression of those observed in the Antarctic Peninsula region during November-December, 1987 by Siegel (1989). The krill sampled at each island site represented different size-maturity groups and demonstrated different horizontal and vertical distributional characteristics. These distributional differences may be related to the demographic differences and/or hydrographic differences between the two sites.																	0722-4060					APR	1993	13	3					171	181									WOS:A1993KW02000005

Following acclimation to this regime, the animals were transferred to identical supplies of the same algal food, pre-labelled with C-14 bicarbonate for 16 h. Faecal pellets were collected individually in each experiment. Following transfer to the radiolabelled food, radioactivity appeared in faecal pellets after 30 min for Isochrysis and 55 min for Thalassiosira. Fitting a first-order kinetic model to the time-course of appearance of radiolabel in faecal pellets, showed that gut turnover (mean residence time of material in the gut) was rapid for krill fed on Isochrysis (turnover time = 47 min) whilst krill took longer to process Thalassiosira (turnover time = 256 min). Uptake rate of radiolabel by the two algae differed by an order of magnitude and was inversely related to cell size. Removal of the two algal species by the krill also differed when expressed as either chanages in radiolabel or biomass but overall, similar amounts of lipid were ingested from the two food sources (817 and 615 ng.ml-1 over 12 h for Isochrysis and Thalassiosira, respectively). Assimilation efficiencies for the two algae, calculated on the basis of radiolabelled and total-lipid ingestion and egestion ranged from 63 to 86%. Most of the radioactivity in the fatty acids of Isochrysis was incorporated into C18 compounds, but this distribution did not correspond to the overall mass composition of algal fatty acids. Saturates, 16:1, 18:4 and 20:5 were labelled to a lesser extent. Radiolabelled fatty acids incorporated into krill gut and somatic tissue differed in composition from the original algal fatty acid pool. In particular, there was higher activity in saturates, in 16:3 and 18:4, whilst 18:1, 18:2 and 18:3 were labelled to a lower extent in krill. Overall, fatty acids showed lower specific activity in krill than in algae, except for 16:3. The distribution of radioactivity in faecal pellets showed a character more strongly related to that of the algal food supply than that of the krill, although the high proportion of label in saturates (predominantly 16:0) was derived from the animals. Much of the ingested fatty acids were subsequently catabolised. Taking all the fatty acids, 69% appeared to be lost by this route, indicating the major importance of fatty acids as an energy source for krill. However, some individual fatty acids were conserved, for example saturates and 18:4. In the latter case, biosynthesis from 18:3 is implied. Overall, the study indicates the importance of constructing detailed budgets in understanding the character and dynamics of feeding by zooplankton and suggests that control of grazing by quality as well as quantity of the food supply may be a crucial aspect of understanding ocean carbon cycling.																	0022-0981					APR 28	1995	187	2					253	268		10.1016/0022-0981(94)00187-I							WOS:A1995QX14600008

Summer distribution and demography of Antarctic krill Euphausia superba Dana, 1852 (Euphausiacea) at the South Orkney Islands, 2011-2015	JOURNAL OF CRUSTACEAN BIOLOGY												We carried out a survey of Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba Dana, 1850) from 2011 to 2015 to establish a long-term, time-series dataset of distribution, abundance, and demography for this species in the South Orkney Islands sector of the Southern Ocean. This species is abundant in this region and is subjected to high-intensity fishing, but previous assessments of density and population dynamics are few and outdated. Our data for Antarctic krill was collected from trawl stations along survey line transects covering the South Orkney plateau and shelf region during the summers of five consecutive years. We used concurrent data on hydrography, bathymetry, and proxies for algal biomass to describe potential spatial patterns of demography and abundance of E. superba. Comparative analysis of the demographic composition showed that 2012 differed from the other years by having a higher proportion of juveniles; otherwise a consistent pattern was found among years and within the study area. The highest biomass during the study period occurred along the northern shelf edge of the South Orkney Islands. Results of the linear mixed-effect model used to evaluate a diverse range of variables revealed that the only predictors for this hotspot were the short distance from land and great bottom depth. No clear differences in demographic composition for the study area were detected, which indicates that the area is highly dynamic and dominated by flux and advection of krill, both to, from, and within the area. Despite this finding, the results demonstrate that the shelf break on the northwest South Orkney Islands is predictable over time as a krill concentration and retention hotspot during the summer season.

ANALYSIS OF VARIABILITY OF KRILL SIZE AND FISH BY-CATCH IN THE JAPANESE KRILL FISHERY BASED ON SCIENTIFIC OBSERVER DATA	CCAMLR SCIENCE												To estimate the optimal relative sample size of scientific observer data collected on Antarctic krill commercial fishing vessels, the relationship between statistical precision and sample size was estimated by using variance component analysis. Observer datasets from the Japanese krill fishery from 1995 to 2008 were analysed using a hierarchical Bayesian model. The models were composed of multistage cluster units (i.e. year, subarea, vessel, cruise and haul) based on a state-space model, separating biological process error in the population dynamics from fishery process as observation error. In both krill length and by-catch fish number, the parameters estimated by the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method hardly show difference among years, subareas and vessels. The potent interaction effect between year and subarea suggests large spatio-temporal variability in the size structure of the krill population, which is presumably derived from large variability of recruitment causing difficulty in predicting krill population dynamics. Variances of observer datasets were calculated by the multistage sampling formula with the variance terms derived from the Bayesian model. For both krill length and by-catch fish number, vessel sample size shows marked effects on the coefficient of variation (CV), although haul sample size affects CV for only krill length data up to 10% haul coverage. These results suggest that data collection by scientific observers on board commercial vessels provides important information for the management of krill resources and the Antarctic ecosystem, while further discussion is needed about the optimal relative sample size to ensure the statistical precision required for the specific objective of a study that includes consideration of the cost of observer deployment.																	1023-4063						2012	19						31	47									WOS:000318781400003

The observation was conducted in the Indian Ocean sector of the Southern Ocean in January 2014. The transmit signal was a 10-ms linear frequency-modulated signal with a frequency sweep of 20-200 kHz. A large aggregation of Antarctic krill was observed at a sampling station over the continental shelf. The volume-backscattering strengths in the frequency range of 85-187 kHz were determined from the observed echoes. In addition, the signal-to-noise ratio at each frequency was estimated and the measured volume-backscattering strengths were evaluated before inversion for accurate inferences. In this inversion, Antarctic krill were modeled as prolate spheroids and the target strengths were predicted by the distorted-wave Born approximation. The acoustically inferred mean length was in good agreement with the mode length determined by a net sampling performed immediately after the echo sampling. Also, the acoustically inferred length-frequency distribution was in reasonable agreement with the determined one from the net samples. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. and NIPR. All rights reserved.

Abundance and distribution of Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) nearshore of Cape Shirreff, Livingston Island, Antarctica, during six austral summers between 2000 and 2007	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												Abundance and distribution of Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) in the nearshore waters north of Livingston Island, Antarctica, were characterized from six small-boat surveys conducted in late January or early February from 2000 to 2007. The first three surveys (2000, 2002, 2004) were conducted using a 120 kHz split-beam echosounder to measure water column acoustic backscatter. The last three surveys (2005-2007) were conducted using 38 kHz and 200 kHz singlebeam echosounders. A portion of the acoustic backscatter was attributed to Antarctic krill based on the results of net tows, underwater video observations, and a multiple-frequency acoustic classification algorithm. The annual mean krill biomass density in the survey area ranged from 11 to 84 g.m(-2). Results are compared with the western Scotia Sea area of the US Antarctic Marine Living Resources (AMLR) program's acoustic surveys of krill biomass density for the same years. Near-shore krill biomass densities were significantly larger (t test, p < 0.05), more stable, and the coefficients of variation were smaller than the much larger AMLR surveys. Increased competition between seals, penguins, and humans for the nearshore krill resource, especially during the austral summer months, could impact the recruitment success of these land-based krill predators. Implications of nearshore krill biomass on small-scale management units are discussed.

This raises the question of how the initial adaptation to extreme cold temperatures was put in place and whether or not directional selection has led to the loss of genetic variation at key adaptive systems, and thus polar species' (re) adaptability to higher temperatures. In the Southern Ocean, krill represents the most abundant fauna and is a critical member at the base of the Antarctic food web. To better understand the role of selection in shaping current patterns of polymorphisms, we examined genetic diversity of the cox-1 and hsp70 genes by comparing two closely related species of Euphausiid that differ in ecology. Results on mtcox-1 agreed with previous studies, indicating high and similar effective population sizes. However, a coalescent-based approach on hsp70 genes highlighted the role of positive selection and past demographic changes in their recent evolution. Firstly, some form of balancing selection was acting on the inducible isoform C, which reflected the maintenance of an ancestral adaptive polymorphism in both species. Secondly, E. crystallorophias seems to have lost most of its hsp70 diversity because of a population crash and/or directional selection to cold. Nonsynonymous diversities were always greater in E. superba, suggesting that it might have evolved under more heterogeneous conditions.

J	PAKHOMOV, EA				PAKHOMOV, EA			NATURAL AGE-DEPENDENT MORTALITY-RATES OF ANTARCTIC KRILL EUPHAUSIA-SUPERBA DANA IN THE INDIAN SECTOR OF THE SOUTHERN-OCEAN	POLAR BIOLOGY												Data on the size and age composition of Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba Dana) were collected in the Cooperation and Cosmonaut Seas (Indian sector of the Southern Ocean) from 1985 to 1990. The estimation of the age-dependent annual extinction rate of krill [THETA = 1 - exp(- M)] was obtained using the Zikov and Slepokurov (1982) approach and results were fitted by a parabolic equation. The coefficients of instantaneous natural mortality (M) of E. superba derived with this approach range from 0.52 during the maturation period, to 1.1-2.41 during the first and last years of life. The aim of this work is to apply an ichthyological approach to the estimation of natural, age-dependent, mortality rates of Antarctic krill. All data used in the analysis are from the central part of the Indian sector of the Southern Ocean.																	0722-4060					JAN	1995	15	1					69	71									WOS:A1995PX44100011

The treatments correspond to samples combined with different mixtures of antioxidants and sinergistic acids. The pigments time degradation followed a first order kinetics. The mixture etoxiquin/citric acid at pH 4, stabilized in a better way the pigments during the storage (p < 0,05), obtaining a constant kinetics (K) similar to 0.0263 days and a mean life time (t(1/2)) of 26.3 days.																	0001-9704					MAR-APR	2000	57	486					135	138									WOS:000087561400010						
J	Rathod, V				Rathod, V			Zooplankton studies with special reference to krill Euphausia superba Dana from fishing area 58 of Indian Ocean sector in Southern Ocean	CURRENT SCIENCE												Distribution, abundance and species composition of zooplankton collected during the First Indian Antarctic Krill Expedition were studied. Zooplankton biomass values ranged from 9.79 to 303.62 ml 100 m(-3) (x = 142.14 +/- 77.02). High standing stock values were recorded in the study area, where copepods, chaetognaths, euphausiids and salps were dominant taxa. Copepods and chaetognaths formed the major constituents of zooplankton community and comprised more than 70% of zooplankton catch. Swarms of krill and salps were observed during the study period (austral summer), which were the prime cause for high standing stock of zooplankton. The prevailing physico-chemical parameters with rich food supply were important factors influencing the geographical distribution of different zooplankton groups. The study revealed that the present investigation site falls under potential krill fishing ground.																	0011-3891					AUG 25	2005	89	4					681	686									WOS:000231637800031

This little shrimp-like crustacean near the bottom of the food chain did not only promise to provide enough protein for a growing world population. It also paved Germany's way into the Antarctic Treaty System and led to the foundation of the Alfred-Wegener-Institute for Polar and Marine Research in 1981.

Foraging behaviour in two Antarctic fur seal colonies with differing population recoveries	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												We compared Antarctic fur seals Arctocephalus gazella breeding at 2 contrasting sites on South Georgia: one high density colony at Bird Island and one lower density colony at Cooper Bay. The population at Cooper Bay was considerably smaller than that at Bird Island despite ample suitable breeding area being available. At Cooper Bay, female seals were longer but weighed less than those breeding at Bird Island and, whilst both maintained the same rate of female pup growth, male pups grew faster at Cooper Bay. Although Bird Island seals dived deeper, they dived less often than Cooper Bay seals so that both populations spent comparable amounts of time in the bottom phase of dives actively foraging. Longer distance oceanic foraging trips that were observed at Bird Island were almost entirely absent from Cooper Bay. Both populations fed on Antarctic krill, but there was an absence of myctophid prey in the diet of seals at Cooper Bay. Evidence suggests that the favoured myctophid prey of fur seals at South Georgia, Protomyctophum choriodon, are absent from the colder waters around the south-east of the island. We propose that, if these energy-rich prey are unavailable in this region then seals at Cooper Bay may find it hard to offset the increased costs of foraging trips with longer duration and distance. This potentially reduced niche width means that the Cooper Bay population may be less buffered against environmental variability. Although food resources appeared to be sufficient during the period of our study, the south-eastern region of South Georgia has increased variability in food resources that, coupled with a smaller area in which to forage, might explain the reduced population size compared to the north-eastern end of the island.

It also acts as an ecosystem engineer, affecting carbon sequestration and recycling iron and nitrogen, and has increasing importance as a commercial product in the aquaculture and health industries. Here we describe the creation of a de novo assembled head transcriptome for E. superba. As an example of its potential as a molecular resource, we relate its exploitation in identifying and characterizing numerous genes related to the circadian clock in E. superba, including the major components of the central feedback loop. We have made the transcriptome openly accessible for a wider audience of ecologists, molecular biologists, evolutionary geneticists, and others in a user-friendly format at SuperbaSE, hosted at www.krill.le.ac.uk.

J	Catard, A; Weimerskirch, H; Cherel, Y				Catard, A; Weimerskirch, H; Cherel, Y			Exploitation of distant Antarctic waters and close shelf-break waters by white-chinned petrels rearing chicks	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												The foraging ecology of white-chinned petrels Procellaria aequinoctialis rearing chicks was examined at the Crozet Islands in the Southern Ocean. based on satellite tracking, diet and provisioning studies. White-chinned petrels from the Crozet Islands exploit a wide variety of marine environments ranging from sub-tropical waters to the limit of pack-ice at the edge of the Antarctic continent. This capability was made possible by the use of a 2-fold strategy whereby adults exploit alternatively distant oceanic waters and neritic slope waters in the vicinity of the breeding grounds. On average the birds conducted a long foraging trip followed by 2.2 short trips. During trips of long duration over oceanic waters, birds tended to commute mainly to cold, deep Antarctic waters where most foraging activity took place. They commuted from and returned to Crozet at high speeds (mean 31 and 34 km h(-1) respectively) with a mean foraging range of 1868 km (maximum 2421 km). In Antarctic waters, the white-chimed petrel appears to feed mainly on pelagic fishes and on Antarctic krill Euphausia superba and concentrates its efforts in waters with sea-surface temperatures of 2 degrees C. During short trips the birds commuted to the Crozet shelf break, where they fed mainly on fish. Diet samples delivered to chicks after short trips indicate that adults relied at least in part on food made available by longliners as baits and discards. Despite its small size compared to albatrosses, the white-chinned petrel from Crozet appears to be a particularly wide-ranging species and an opportunistic feeder in terms of the marine environment exploited, which explains its wide distribution in the Southern Ocean. This study highlights the particular importance of Antarctic waters for this sub-Antarctic species during the chide-rearing period, i.e. in summer when the retreat of the pack-ice makes abundant resources such as Antarctic krill available.

A combination of affinity chromatography (Con A-Sepharose), gel filtration (Superose 6) and fast protein liquid chromatography (Mono Q) was used for the purification. The hyaluronidase activity was determined by a radial diffusion method based on hyaluronic acid incorporated into an agarose gel. Moreover, the beta-glucuronidase and endo-(1,3)-beta-D-glucanase activities were also followed through the process using phenolphtalein mono beta-glucuronic acid and laminarin as substrates. After the final purification step on Mono Q column, the chromatogram showed three main peaks designated A, B and C. Peak C contained high hyaluronidase activity undetectable in peak A and B. The beta-glucuronidase activity was associated with peak A, while the endo-(1,3)-beta-D-glucanase activity was found in peak B and slight in peak C. The hyaluronidase was purified about 85-fold. It had a pH optimum of 5.3, a temperature optimum of 37-degrees-C and a molecular weight of 80 000 Daltons. On polyacrylamide gradient gel electrophoresis the enzyme fraction showed one major band associated with hyaluronic acid decomposition, slightly contaminated with a few other components. Isoelectric focusing in combination with a hyaluronic acid zymogram demonstrated one major band at pH 6.7 with high enzyme activity. Preliminary data on enzyme specificity suggest that krill hyaluronidase is a new endo-beta-glucuronidase and support the concept of krill enzymes as a remarkable and unusually effective digestive system adapted to the Antarctic marine ecosystem.																	0722-4060					DEC	1991	11	7					501	507									WOS:A1991GU47800011

Larval development of Euphausia pacifica in the laboratory: variability in developmental pathways	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												Gravid adult female Euphausia pacifica were collected off Newport, Oregon, USA and transferred to the laboratory, where females spawned eggs, eggs hatched, and larvae were reared at 10.5 degrees C. We fed 4 cohorts of larvae to excess with a combination of phytoplankton species and monitored them daily until they reached the juvenile stage. The euphausiids were maintained separately (1 individual per jar) from the third furcilia (FIII) to the juvenile stage to observe developmental pathways. Individual cohorts developed at nearly the same rate until the first furcilia stage, after which 2 cohorts began to develop significantly faster than the others. Median time to the juvenile stage ranged from 51.9 to 60.6 d, with significant differences among cohorts. The first calyptopis stage and the third furcilia stage lasted longer than any other stages and appear to be bottlenecks in the development of this species. Individual development from FIII to juvenile varied widely both within and among cohorts. We observed 4 main developmental pathways. Over half of the euphausiids skipped 1 development stage between FIII and juvenile (58 %), and none skipped multiple stages. There was no tendency for individuals from the same cohort to follow the same developmental pathway. This variability in development may be even higher in the field and could impact mortality calculations and cohort analysis from field samples.																	0171-8630						2006	316						127	137		10.3354/meps316127							WOS:000239512600011

In this study, corolase PP was used to hydrolyze Antarctic krill protein. The hydrolysate (AKH) was isolated by ultrafiltration and purified by size-exclusion chromatography, ion exchange chromatography and reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) sequentially. The in vitro inhibitory activities of all AKHs and several fractions obtained against ACE and DPP-IV were assessed. Two peptides, purified with dual-strength inhibitory activity against ACE and DPP-IV, were identified by TOF-MS/MS. Results indicated that not all fractions exhibited dual inhibitory activities of ACE and DPP-IV. The purified peptide Lys-Val-Glu-Pro-Leu-Pro had half-maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC50) of 0.93 +/- 0.05 and 0.73 +/- 0.04 mg/mL against ACE and DPP-IV, respectively. The other peptide Pro-Ala-Leu had IC50 values of 0.64 +/- 0.05 and 0.88 +/- 0.03 mg/mL against ACE and DPP-IV, respectively. This study firstly reported the sequences of dual bioactive peptides from Antarctic krill proteins, further provided new insights into the bioactive peptides responsible for the ACE and DPP-IV inhibitory activities from the Antarctic krill protein hydrolysate to manage hypertension and diabetes.																	0022-1147	1750-3841				JUL	2017	82	7					1742	1749		10.1111/1750-3841.13735							WOS:000405525900032	28556182

A post-processing method to remove interference noise from acoustic data collected from Antarctic krill fishing vessels	CCAMLR SCIENCE												The use of fishing-vessel-based acoustic data has been recognised as an important way to estimate the distribution and relative abundance of Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba), yet the quality and even the utility of the data may be seriously degraded by interference noise due to the lack of synchronisation of the acoustic instruments found on some of the vessels. A simple method to remove significant interference noise was introduced based on relevant virtual variable operators in the existing acoustic data post-processing software. The utility of the method was demonstrated by applying it to the acoustic data at 38, 70 and 120 kHz collected from a Chinese krill fishing vessel. Results show that the interference noise was effectively reduced while structure and echo strength of the krill swarms were retained. The method may provide opportunity to improve the utility of fishing-vessel-based acoustic data for a range of objectives.																	1023-4063						2016	23						17	30									WOS:000389894300002

The power of ecosystem monitoring	AQUATIC CONSERVATION-MARINE AND FRESHWATER ECOSYSTEMS					Symposium in Honor of Professor John Croxall held at the British-Antarctic-Survey	APR 06-07, 2006	Cambridge, ENGLAND	British Antarctic Survey				1. Implementing an ecosystem approach to fisheries management requires an effective ecosystem monitoring programme, the utility of which depends upon its ability (measured by the statistical power) to detect effects that trigger management action. 2. Using data from a long-term ecosystem monitoring programme of the predators of Antarctic krill Euphausia superba at South Georgia together with a krill population model to simulate natural and fisheries induced variability in krill abundance, the power to detect the effects of different levels of fishing was examined. 3. The power to detect the effects of fishing using either the krill population or a combined predator response index was low (20-40% power after 20 years with the probability of a type I error (alpha) = 0.05). The power increased to > 50% when a was increased to 0.2 when the ability to detect change was greater with the predator response index than using the krill population itself. 4. The results indicate that although this monitoring programme has a proven ability to detect the effects of natural variability in krill abundance, its ability to detect the effects of fishing may be limited if there is a requirement for statistical significance at the 95% level. A situation where changing a produces a marked increase in statistical power, and the difference in the relative ecological costs of making type I and type II errors is likely to be high, may require a more flexible approach to choosing significance levels required to trigger management action. 5. Although long-term monitoring provides a wealth of basic ecological information it is essential to evaluate, the ability to detect specific changes in order that management action is not delayed because of an inability to detect an effect rather than the lack of an effect of the fishery.

J	Hill, SL; Atkinson, A; Pakhomov, EA; Siegel, V				Hill, Simeon L.; Atkinson, Angus; Pakhomov, Evgeny A.; Siegel, Volker			Evidence for a decline in the population density of Antarctic krill Euphausia superba still stands. A comment on Cox et al	JOURNAL OF CRUSTACEAN BIOLOGY												Antarctic krill (Euphausia superbaDana, 1850) exemplifies the key role of marine crustaceans in fisheries, foodwebs, and biogeochemical cycles. Ecological understanding and policy decisions require information on population trends. We have therefore worked with international colleagues to publish KRILLBASE, a database of fishery-independent krill population information for every decade since the 1970s. These data were used by Cox et al. (2018) who dispute the evidence for a late twentieth-century decline in krill density (number per unit area) in the Southwest Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean and claim to overturn much of recent thinking about climate-driven change in krill populations. They support this claim with an analysis which reaffirms one non-significant result from an earlier paper but does not challenge the five significant results from that paper or those of other studies which support a decline. In this comment we examine the methods which led Cox and coauthors to conclude that krill density has been stable over the last 40 years. Although these authors provide a potentially useful approach, we show that their analysis was biased by the exclusion of usable net types, the inclusion of negatively biased data and down-weighting of high densities in the early part of the analysis period, the absence of recent data from the north of the sector, and a lack of statistical hypothesis testing. These factors maximise the chances of failure to detect a real decline. To aid future analyses we provide recommendations to supplement those which accompany KRILLBASE. We also suggest the need for consensus scientific advice on krill population dynamics based on agreed standards of evidence, evaluation of uncertainty, and a thorough understanding of the data. This will be more useful to policy makers and other stakeholders than polarised opinions. Meanwhile, the evidence for a decline in krill density still stands.

Phospholipids (PL), fatty acids (FA) composition and minor components including sterols, astaxanthin, vitamin A and tocopherols in the extracted krill oil were analyzed. The results indicated that ethanol and isopropanol led to comparatively higher lipid yields (16.33 and 14.52%, respectively) and PL contents (39.2 and 38.7%, respectively) but lower contents of the minor components than the other solvents. The krill oil extracted with acetone had the lowest PL content (20.63%) but contained more astaxanthin (206.74 mg/kg), vitamin A (27.84 mg/100 g), and sterols (39.00 mg/g). Moreover, high levels of n-3 FA were present in the extracts with high PL contents. Further analysis revealed that 23.6528.10% of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and 16.71-21.03% of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) were present in the PL, while only 2.83-3.48% of EPA and 1.40-1.74% of DHA were detected in the triacylglycerols (TAG). In addition, subcritical butane proved to be an alternative to n-hexane and isohexane; krill oil extracted with these three solvents had similar qualities. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Different primers and probes of dominant copepod species (Oithona sp., Ctenocalanus citer, copepodid stages of Metridia gerlachei and Calanoides acutus), co-occurring with larval krill under sea ice during winter, were developed for quantitative PCR (qPCR) and their species specificity was tested on target and non-target species. The qPCR results showed that larval krill were exclusively feeding on Oithona sp. This result was confirmed by microscopic analysis of stomach and gut contents of larvae from the same stations.

Palmer Deep Canyon, a representative hotspot, is known to have higher phytoplankton biomass than the surrounding non-canyon regions. The physical mechanisms that maintain and deliver phytoplankton and Antarctic krill biomass, potentially increasing prey availability to predators, are not well known. To better understand these important mechanisms, we deployed a purpose built integrated polar observatory consisting of high frequency radar, coordinated gliders, and moorings. The gliders identified a depth dependent influence of the underlying canyon bathymetry on physical and biological variability. A series of simulated particle release experiments in the HF radar current maps were used to estimate surface residence time and connectivity across the canyon. With an average residence time of 2 days, our analysis indicates that the elevated phytoplankton biomass over the central canyon is transported into and out of the hotspot on time scales much shorter than the observed phytoplankton growth rate, suggesting that the canyon may not act as an incubator of phytoplankton productivity as previously suggested. It may instead serve more as a conveyor belt of phytoplankton biomass produced elsewhere, continually replenishing the phytoplankton biomass for the local krill community, which in turn supports numerous top predators.																			978-1-5386-5485-9				2019																	WOS:000533898600001

Spatio-temporal variability in the winter diet of larval and juvenile Antarctic krill, Euphausia superba, in ice-covered waters	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												Antarctic krill Euphausia superba is an ecological key species in the Southern Ocean and a major fisheries resource. The winter survival of age class 0 (AC0) krill is susceptible to changes in the sea-ice environment due to their association with sea ice and their need to feed during their first winter. However, our understanding of their overwintering diet and its variability is limited. We studied the spatio-temporal variability of the diet in 4 cohorts of AC0 krill in the Northern Weddell Sea during late winter 2013 using stomach contents, fatty acids (FAs) and bulk stable isotope analysis (BSIA). Stomach contents were dominated by diatoms in numbers and occasionally contained large volumes of copepods. Many of the prey species found in the stomachs were sea ice-associated. Our results show that the diet of overwintering AC0 krill varies significantly in space and time. Variability in stomach content composition was related to environmental factors, including chlorophyll a concentration, copepod abundance and sea-ice cover. In contrast, FA composition mainly varied between cohorts, indicating variation in the long-term diet. The condition of the AC0 krill was reflected in FA and BSIA analysis, suggesting that the availability of sea ice-derived food sources over a long period may impact the condition of developing AC0 krill significantly. The spatio-temporal availability of sea-ice resources is a potentially important factor for AC0 krill winter survival.

The reconstructions were generated from line-transect acoustic survey data gathered in the boxes during austral summers from 1996 to 2000. Krill densities had previously been determined at approximately 0.5 km intervals along each of the ten 80 km transects in each box, providing about 1600 density estimates per box. The MaxEnt technique uses an iterative Bayesian approach to infer the most probable krill density for each of the 32 000 0.5 x 0.5 km cells in each box, taking explicit account of the spatial relationship between densities in the observed data. Despite some very large interannual and regional differences in mean krill density, the MaxEnt approach works well, providing plausible maps of krill distribution. The maps reveal some consistent 'hot spots' of krill distribution, knowledge of which could aid the understanding of mechanisms influencing krill distribution, and hence krill/predator interactions. The MaxEnt technique also yields mean krill densities for each survey, for which the confidence limits are often narrower than those determined from conventional statistical analyses.

The concentration of free choline in serum may decrease during long-distance high-intensity exercise, yet few nutritional strategies to counteract this potentially performance-depleting loss in choline have been investigated outside the laboratory. This exploratory field study was performed to investigate if pre-race supplementation with phosphatidylcholine from krill oil can counteract the expected drop in choline and some of its metabolites during triathlon competitions. Forty-seven triathletes, 12 females and 35 males ranging in age from 25 to 61 years, were recruited from participants in the Ironman-distance Norseman Xtreme triathlon and the Sprint/Olympic-distance Oslo Triathlon. Twenty-four athletes were randomly allocated to the krill oil group, receiving 4 g of SuperbaBoost (TM) krill oil daily for 5 weeks prior to the race, and 23 athletes were randomly allocated to the placebo group, receiving 4 g of mixed vegetable oil daily. Blood samples were obtained before the race, immediately after completion of the race, and the day after the race for analysis of choline and its metabolites. The results showed that serum choline concentrations significantly decreased from pre-race to race finish in all races, with a more pronounced decrease observed in the Ironman-distance Norseman Xtreme triathlon (34% decrease) relative to the Sprint/Olympic-distance Oslo Triathlon (15% decrease). A reduction in betaine was also observed, while dimethylglycine (DMG) concentrations remained stable across all time points. Significantly higher concentrations of choline (9.4% on average) and DMG (21.4% on average) were observed in the krill oil compared to the placebo group, and the krill oil group showed a significantly greater increase in serum choline following race completion. In conclusion, krill oil may help to prevent that circulating choline concentrations become limiting during endurance competitions.

Improving methodology and predicting intermolt period	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												The growth rates of postlarval krill (Euphausia superba) were measured across a wide range of environments in the Scotia Sea and around South Georgia using the Instantaneous Growth Rate (IGR) method. Each IGR experiment determined the intermolt period (IMP) and growth increment at molt (GI) of an average of 120 individuals incubated for 5 d in through-flowing ambient, filtered seawater. We examined the results from 51 IGR experiments involving 5,927 animals ranging between 25 mm and 62 mm. Animals were collected from an area that covered a latitudinal range of 10 degrees and surface temperatures of between -0.85 degrees C and 4.75 degrees C. The measurement of IMP has rarely been achieved in IGR experiments because synchronous molting biases estimates. We overcame this by applying a binary logistic regression model to Our data. This related IMP to temperature, body length, and Maturity stage. Food did not influence IMP. Our model estimated that krill within Our experiments had IMPs ranging from 9 d to 57 d. Temperature affected the IMP of females more than that of males. The IMPs of females were shortest around 2 degrees C and increased at lower and higher temperatures. IMP increased with body size and altered according to gender, with male IMPs being 50% longer than those of equivalently sized females. One of the main assumptions of the IGR method is that the GI measured in the first few days reflects the in situ conditions experienced by krill in the previous intermolt period. However, we found that the GIs declined immediately and rapidly after capture, particularly when growth was initially high. Thus, conditions at time of molt also influence GI. We developed a method of correcting measured GIs to natural growth in field conditions. These refinements to IGR methodology (IMP and GI estimation) enable more accurate and precise predictions of krill growth rates in Summer to be made.

The relationship between coastal weather and foraging behaviour of chinstrap penguins, Pygoscelis antarctica	ICES JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE												There is increasing interest in using higher-trophic level predators as ecosystem indicators because their performance is presumed to be linked to the overall function of the ecosystem that supports them. In the southwest Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean, Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) supports huge predator populations as well as a growing commercial fishery. To utilize information from the ecosystem in an adaptive framework for sustainably managing krill catch levels, performance indices of krill predators have been proposed as a proxy for krill abundance. However, there are several potentially confounding sources of variability that might impact predator performance such as the effects of environmental variability and fishing pressure on krill availability at scales relevant to predators. In this context, our study capitalises on the occurrence of an unexpected El Nino event to characterise how environmental variability can drive changes in predator foraging behaviour. We demonstrate a clear link between coastal downwelling and changes in the at-sea habitat usage of chinstrap penguins (Pygoscelis antarctica) foraging in a local krill fishing area. Penguins tracked from their breeding colonies on Powell Island, Antarctic Peninsula, undertook fewer, longer foraging trips during the downwelling-affected season compared with the season where no such downwelling was detected, suggesting that changes in climate-driven oceanography may have reduced krill availability along the northern shelf of the island. Our study demonstrates that penguin foraging behaviour is modified by scale-dependent processes, which if not accounted for may result in erroneous conclusions being drawn when using penguins as bioindicators of krill abundance.

Growth, feed conversion and chemical composition of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.) and Atlantic halibut (Hippoglossus hippoglossus L.) fed diets supplemented with krill or amphipods	AQUACULTURE NUTRITION												The effects of partial replacement of. fish meal (FM) with meal made from northern krill (Thysanoessa inermis), Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) or Arctic amphipod (Themsto libellula) as protein source in the diets for Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.) and Atlantic halibut (Hippoglossus hippoglossus L.) on growth, feed conversion, macro-nutrient utilization, muscle chemical composition and fish welfare were studied. Six experimental diets were prepared using a low-temperature FM diet as control. The other diets included northern krill where 20, 40 or 60% of the dietary FM protein was replaced with protein from northern krill, and two diets where the FM protein was replaced with protein from Antarctic krill or Arctic amphipod at 40% protein replacement level. All diets were iso-nitrogenous and iso-caloric. Atlantic salmon grew from 410 g to approximately 1500 g during the 160 day experiment, and Atlantic halibut grew from 345 g to 500-600 g during the 150 day experiment. Inclusion of krill in the diets enhanced specific. c growth rate in salmon, especially during the first 100 days (P < 0.01), and in a dose-response manner in halibut for over the 150 day feeding period (P < 0.05). Feed conversion ratio did not differ between dietary treatments, and no difference was found in dry matter digestibility, protein digestibility and fish muscle composition. Good growth rates, blood parameters within normal ranges and low mortalities in all experimental treatments indicted that fish health was not affected either Atlantic salmon or Atlantic halibut fed the various zooplankton diets.

J	KARLSTAM, B				KARLSTAM, B			CROSSED IMMUNOELECTROPHORETIC ANALYSIS OF PROTEINS FROM ANTARCTIC KRILL (EUPHAUSIA-SUPERBA) WITH SPECIAL REFERENCE TO SERINE PROTEINASES	POLAR BIOLOGY												Immunochemicai characterization of proteins from Antarctic krill (E. superba) and particularly serine proteinases was performed by crossed immunoelectrophoresis (CIE). A reference pattern with 34 arbitrarily numbered immunoprecipitates was established for a crude krill extract using IgG rabbit antiserum. A zymographic technique for detection of proteolytic activity was applied and revealed 4 casein-positive antigens. Introduction of different affinity media as intermediate gels in CIE demonstrated several proteins which strongly interacted with Sepharose-bound arginine and Con A. These results suggest the presence of trypsin-like enzymes and other serine proteases and a high content of glycoproteins with alfa-D-mannopyranoside and alfa-D-glycopyranoside residues. The CIE method thus offers a reliable and reproducible tool for identification and characterization of different krill enzymes as well as application in process control, when purifying individual proteins/enzymes. Moreover this technology may serve as a fingerprinting method suitable for biological studies such as classification of geographical subpopulations, genotyping a specific species as well as comparisons between different species.																	0722-4060					DEC	1991	11	7					489	493									WOS:A1991GU47800009						
J	Murphy, EJ; Reid, K				Murphy, EJ; Reid, K			Modelling Southern Ocean krill population dynamics: biological processes generating fluctuations in the South Georgia ecosystem	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												Variability is a key feature of the pelagic ecosystems of the Southern Ocean and an important aspect of the variation is fluctuation in the abundance of krill Euphausia superba Dana, the major prey item of many of the higher predators. Direct impacts of variability in the large-scale physical environment, such as changes in ocean circulation, have been suggested as the main factor generating the observed fluctuations, So far, however, there has been little quantitative assessment of the importance of krill population dynamics in the observed variation. Here, analyses of a model of krill population development and predator diet data from South Georgia have been used to examine seasonal changes in the population structure of krill. The krill population model was combined with a size-based selection function and used to generate expected length-frequency distributions in the predator diet through a summer season. Comparison of the model solutions with the predator diet data indicates that the model can reproduce the observed pattern of variation and emphasizes that adult population changes are a key aspect of the interannual fluctuations observed during some years. Low krill abundance was associated with reduced representation of the 3+ age group (3 to 4 yr old), whereas when krill were abundant the 3+ age class was the major age group present. The seasonal changes in the population structure in the predator diet involve a complex interaction of relative year class strength, timing of immigration, fluctuations in growth rates and dynamic predator-selective effects, Development of the model to examine the interactive effects of changing krill growth and mortality rates will be a valuable next step. The dominance of the changes in krill population age structure underlines the fact that to understand the variability of the South Georgia ecosystem we must identify the major factors generating variability in population dynamics throughout the Scotia Sea.																	0171-8630						2001	217						175	189		10.3354/meps217175							WOS:000170790300016						
J	Boyd, IL; Staniland, IJ; Martin, AR				Boyd, IL; Staniland, IJ; Martin, AR			Distribution of foraging by female Antarctic fur seals	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												The study examined the distribution of critical habitat for foraging by female Antarctic fur seals breeding at the island of South Georgia. Bathymetric features of the continental shelf around the island of South Georgia were an important indicator for the localisation of foraging. This pattern was consistent among years of different prey availability. Lactating females were constrained to forage mainly within 100 km of the location at which the offspring was being raised. When this constraint was removed at the end of lactation, females foraged to much greater ranges and dispersed to specific regions of the continental shelf east of Patagonia (>1000 km) and to the northern edge of the Antarctic pack ice (500 km). The empirical distribution of foraging during the breeding season was used to develop a function that described the foraging distribution for the whole breeding population of females. The result was consistent with past observations from ship-based surveys and it allowed estimation of the spatial impact of breeding female fur seals on krill at South Georgia. This suggested that, in extreme cases and assuming that krill influx is limited, female fur seals could eat most of the krill present in some regions where they forage intensively. However, mean consumption was about one-tenth of the mean density of krill.

Varying depth and swarm dimensions of open-ocean Antarctic krill Euphausia superba Dana, 1850 (Euphausiacea) over diel cycles	JOURNAL OF CRUSTACEAN BIOLOGY												Diel vertical migration (DVM) behaviour in swarms of Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba Dana, 1850) is notoriously variable, with swarms being found at a range of depths and in different shapes, sizes, and packing concentrations throughout the day-night cycle. Because social aggregation can potentially serve the same purpose as DVM in minimising predation risk, krill may use both strategies to varying extents. Diel variation was examined in swarm depth, length, perimeter, area, thickness, and packing concentration across 4,130 open-ocean swarms in the Scotia Sea during summer. Inter-relationships between each of the swarm descriptors were complex but multivariate analyses identified pairings in levels of similarity between area and perimeter, thickness and packing concentration, and depth and length. Second-stage analysis further identified diel cyclicity in these relationships. Swarm parameters were more variable than depth over the diel cycle, identifying swarming to be the primary diel response to which DVM is a secondary contributor.

J	Pauly, T; Penrose, JD				Pauly, T; Penrose, JD			Laboratory target strength measurements of free-swimming Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba)	JOURNAL OF THE ACOUSTICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA												Target strength measurements of free-swimming krill at 120 kHz were made using a single-beam monostatic system in a 10-m(3) laboratory tank. Krill (grouped according to length classes) swam freely in the tank triggering a data acquisition system when generating a backscattered signal larger than a threshold, determined by the system noise level. Dorsal and ventral target strength estimates were calculated indirectly by deconvolution of the cumulative probability function of echo ensembles of single-animal insonifications. For mean length classes in the range [29.6 to 36.2] mm the median single-animal target strengths are in the range [-76.7 to -71.8] dB. Monte Carlo computer simulations were used to evaluate the effects of varying the ratio of largest to smallest echo amplitudes for a given ensemble, thus enabling the estimation of threshold induced bias in the target strength estimates. The threshold induced bias was then determined for each ensemble of experimental data and used to determine corrections which were in the range of [-0.84 to -0.33] dB. An error analysis of the target strength estimates detailing the components due to measurement accuracy and precision, and the indirect signal processing techniques used is also presented.

Krill faecal pellets drive hidden pulses of particulate organic carbon in the marginal ice zone	NATURE COMMUNICATIONS												The biological carbon pump drives a flux of particulate organic carbon (POC) through the ocean and affects atmospheric levels of carbon dioxide. Short term, episodic flux events are hard to capture with current observational techniques and may thus be underrepresented in POC flux estimates. We model the potential hidden flux of POC originating from Antarctic krill, whose swarming behaviour could result in a major conduit of carbon to depth through their rapid exploitation of phytoplankton blooms and bulk egestion of rapidly sinking faecal pellets (FPs). Our model results suggest a seasonal krill FP export flux of 0.039 GT C across the Southern Ocean marginal ice zone, corresponding to 17-61% (mean 35%) of current satellite-derived export estimates for this zone. The magnitude of our conservatively estimated flux highlights the important role of large, swarming macrozooplankton in POC export and, the need to incorporate such processes more mechanistically to improve model projections.

The hydrolysate prepared from each meat was added to lizard fish myofibrils in the concentration range of 2.5-12.5%, and the changes in the amount of unfrozen water in myofibrils associated with dehydration were analyzed by a differential scanning calorimetry, Ca2+ -ATPase activity of myofibrils was simultaneously measured and the results were compared with those for the hydrolysates of two species of shrimps. The amount of unfrozen water was increased by the addition of each hydrolysate. A decrease in ATPase activity during dehydration was relieved synchronously with the increase of unfrozen water, indicating a close correlation between ATPase activity and the amount of unfrozen water. Addition of 5.0-7.5% of the hydrolysates showed the notice effect. These results suggest that the denaturation of myofibrils can be suppressed by the addition of the hydrolysates, since the hydrolysates constructed water molecules resulting in an increase in the amount of unfrozen water.																	1341-027X						2002	49	2					91	98									WOS:000174954400004

The primary objective of the survey was to improve estimates of the pre-exploitation biomass of krill which are used in models to estimate sustainable yield in Area 48. The survey design includes two large-scale oceanic strata: one in the southwest Atlantic located in the Scotia Sea, and the other to the north of the Antarctic Peninsula (CCAMLR Statistical Subareas 48.1, 48.2, 48.3 and 48.4). Within these large-scale strata, four mesoscale strata were included in the survey design; these were located close to the South Sandwich Islands, north of South Georgia, north of the South Orkney Islands and north of the South Shetland Islands. The rationale underlying the selection of the strata and survey boundaries is described. The methods used for selecting the location of each survey transect are explained and the planned cruise tracks for each of the four vessels participating in the survey are shown. Details are also described for adaptively modifying the survey during its execution. This includes information how net haul stations should be selected and how transects should be modified if the planned survey tracks cannot be completed. The survey took place in January-February 2000 and involved ships from Japan, Russia, UK and the USA. Scientists from many more CCAMLR Member States and the International Whaling Commission (IWC) took part. The survey is by far the biggest single exercise ever carried out by Members in support of the Convention. Full analysis of the results of the CCAMLR-2000 Survey will take several years and will result in a significant increase in the knowledge of krill length frequencies, biomass and distribution in the area studied.

J	Fraser, WR; Hofmann, EE				Fraser, WR; Hofmann, EE			A predator's perspective on causal links between climate change, physical forcing and ecosystem response	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												The mechanisms by which variability in sea ice cover and its effects on the demography of the Antarctic krill Euphausia superba cascade to other ecosystem components such as apex predators remain poorly understood at all spatial and temporal scales, yet these interactions are essential for understanding causal links between climate change, ecosystem response and resource monitoring and management in the Southern Ocean. To address some of these issues, we examined the long-term foraging responses of Adelie penguins Pygoscelis adeliae near Palmer Station, western Antarctic Peninsula, in relation to ice-induced changes in krill recruitment and availability. Our results suggest that (1) there is a direct, causal relationship between variability in ice cover, krill recruitment, prey availability and predator foraging ecology, (2) regional patterns and trends detected in this study are consistent with similar observations in areas as far north as South Georgia, and (3) large-scale forcing associated with the Antarctic Circumpolar Wave may be governing ecological interactions between ice, krill and their predators in the western Antarctic Peninsula and Scotia Sea regions. Another implication of our analyses is that during the last 2 decades in particular, krill populations have been sustained by strong age classes that emerge episodically every 4 to 5 yr. This raises the possibility that cohort senescence has become an additional ecosystem stressor in an environment where ice conditions conducive to good krill recruitment are deteriorating due to climate warming. In exploring these interactions, our results suggest that at least 1 'senescence event' has already occurred in the western Antarctic Peninsula region, and it accounts for significant coherent decreases in krill abundance, predator populations and predator foraging and breeding performance. We propose that krill longevity should be incorporated into models that seek to identify and understand causal links between climate change, physical forcing and ecosystem response in the western Antarctic Peninsula region.																	0171-8630	1616-1599					2003	265						1	15		10.3354/meps265001							WOS:000188774900001

XRD results showed that the major phase in AAKI was ascribed to apatite. Besides, it was noticed that the (300) peak of AAKI shifted to 33.07 degrees, which was coincident with that of fluorapatite (FA). The FTIR results confirmed the presence of phosphate ions, and the absence of -OH. The EDS results confirmed the presence of Ca, P, O and F elements in the ash sample. The content of FA in the ash was determined to be 50.4%, and the proportion of fluorine in the form of FA to the total fluorine in the integument was 40.5%. Based on the XRD, FTIR and EDS results, it can be concluded that FA was the main form of fluoride in the integument of Antarctic krill.																	2045-2322					MAY 27	2019	9								7853	10.1038/s41598-019-44337-6							WOS:000469011800001	31133736

Protozoans as a food source for Antarctic krill, Euphausia superba: Complementary insights from stomach content, fatty acids, and stable isotopes	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												We studied the diet of Antarctic krill, Euphausia superba, at five stations across the southwest Atlantic sector in summer 2003 by analyzing stomach content, fatty acids, and stable isotopes on the same individuals. Our aim was to examine what each method could contribute to our understanding of krill nutrition and whether differences seen in growth rates were linked to their food. All three methods indicated clear regional differences in diet, but small ontogenetic and sex-related differences. Overall, diatoms were the most abundant item in the stomach, but at three of the stations, tintinnids, large dinoflagellates, and other armored flagellates dominated the identifiable biomass. Copepod remains were rare. Fatty acids profiles gave additional information about feeding on weakly silicified diatoms and athecate heterotrophic dinoflagellates, with the latter being the main food source at one of the stations. Two independent indices of carnivory, delta N-15 and the fatty acid ratio 18:1(n-9)/18:1(n-7), were correlated among krill from the same swarm, suggesting consistent differences in diet between individuals. An internal index of trophic position, (i.e., delta N-15(glutamic) (acid)-delta N-15(phenylalanine)) underlined the importance of heterotrophic food for the nutrition of krill, even in summer. Highest growth rates of krill were found during a diatom bloom and coincided with a mixed diet, large digestive gland, and fast stomach passage. However, even in a nonbloom, flagellate-dominated system, krill were able to sustain medium growth rates when feeding on heterotrophic dinoflagellates. Each method supplied specific information on krill nutrition, and the true picture is only revealed when the various methods are used together.

In this study, we experimentally determined the quantity and spectral quality of CDOM generated by bacterioplankton using two different substrates ( with and without photoproducts) and by Antarctic krill Euphausia superba and evaluated their potential contributions to CDOM dynamics in the peninsular region of the Southern Ocean. CDOM was generated by bacteria in all experiments, and the presence of photoproducts influenced both the quantity and the spectral quality of the resultant CDOM. We confirmed a direct link between bacterial production and CDOM generation, which yielded in situ CDOM duplication times from 31 to 33 d. Antarctic krill as a direct source of CDOM was also confirmed experimentally. We estimated that CDOM generation by krill would lead to CDOM duplication times from 0.48 to 0.80 d within krill swarms. Our findings highlight the potential significance of bacteria and Antarctic krill swarms in the generation of CDOM and underscore the dynamic nature of CDOM in this area.

The South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands MPA: Protecting A Biodiverse Oceanic Island Chain Situated in the Flow of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current	MARINE MANAGED AREAS AND FISHERIES	Advances in Marine Biology											South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands (SGSSI) are surrounded by oceans that are species-rich, have high levels of biodiversity, important endemism and which also support large aggregations of charismatic upper trophic level species. Spatial management around these islands is complex, particularly in the context of commercial fisheries that exploit some of these living resources. Furthermore, management is especially complicated as local productivity relies fundamentally upon biological production transported from outside the area. The MPA uses practical management boundaries, allowing access for the current legal fisheries for Patagonian toothfish, mackerel icefish and Antarctic krill. Management measures developed as part of the planning process designated the whole SGSSI Maritime Zone as an IUCN Category VI reserve, within which a number of IUCN Category I reserves were identified. Multiple-use zones and temporal closures were also designated. A key multiple-use principle was to identify whether the ecological impacts of a particular fishery threatened either the pelagic or benthic domain.

J	Robertson, B; Burri, L; Berge, K				Robertson, Bruce; Burri, Lena; Berge, Kjetil			Genotoxicity test and subchronic toxicity study with Superba (TM) krill oil in rats	TOXICOLOGY REPORTS												The safety of krill oil was assessed in a subchronic toxicity study and in a genotoxicity test. In a 13-week study, rats were fed krill oil or control diets. There were no differences noted in body weight, food consumption or in the functional observation battery parameters in either gender. Differences in both haematology and clinical chemistry values were noted in the krill oil-treated groups. However these findings were of no toxicological significance. Significant decreases in absolute and covariant heart weight in some krill oil-treated animals were noted although no corresponding histological changes were observed. In addition, periportal microvesicular hepatocyte vacuolation was noted histologically in males fed 5% krill oil. This finding was not associated with other indications of hepatic dysfunction. Given that the effects of the 13-week toxicity study were non-toxic in nature, the no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) for the conditions of this study was considered to be 5% krill oil. The genotoxicity experiments documented no mutagenicity of krill oil in bacteria. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

In this study respiration rates and pleopod beating rates were measured at six current speeds. Pleopod beating rates increased linearly with current speed, reaching a maximum of 6 beats s(-1) at 17 cm s(-1). There was a concomitant linear increase in respiration rate, from 1.8 mg O-2 g(D)(-1) h(-1) at 3 cm s(-1) to 8.0 mg O-2 g(D)(-1) h(-1) at 17 cm s(-1). The size of the group tested ( 50, 100 and 300 krill) did not have a significant effect on pleopod beating rates or oxygen consumption (ANCOVA, F= 0.264; P> 0.05). The cost of transport reached a maximum of 75 J g(-1) km(-1) at 5 cm s(-1), and then decreased with increasing current speed to 29 J g(-1) km(-1). When considered in light of energy budgets for E. superba, these data indicate that the cost of swimming could account for up to 73% of total daily metabolic expenditure during early summer.

Stable isotope analyses were conducted on delta C-13 and delta N-15 from the baleen plates of ten pregnant Antarctic minke whales to understand the growth rate of the baleen plate and their diet in lower latitudes. Two to three oscillations along the length of the edge of the baleen plate were observed in delta N-15, and the annual growth rate was estimated to be 75.2 +/- 20.4 mm, with a small amplitude (0.97 +/- 0.21 parts per thousand). Bayesian stable isotope mixing models were used to understand the dominant prey that contributed to the isotopic component of the baleen plate using Antarctic krill from the stomach contents and reported values of Antarctic coastal krill (Euphausia crystallorophias), Antarctic silver fish (Pleuragramma antarcticum), Australian krill spp., and Australian pelagic fish spp.. The models showed that the diet composition of the most recent three records from the base of the baleen plates (model 1) and the highest delta N-15 values in each baleen plate (model 2) were predominantly Antarctic krill, with a contribution rate of approximately 80%. The rates were approximately 10% for Antarctic coastal krill and less than 2.0% for the two Australian prey groups in both models. These results suggest that pregnant Antarctic minke whales did not feed on enough prey outside of the Antarctic to change the stable isotope values in their baleen plates.

Manual processing may introduce subjective, irreproducible decisions into the data processing work flow, reducing consistency in processing between surveys. We introduce the R package EchoviewR as an interface between R and Echoview, a commercially available acoustic processing software package. EchoviewR allows for automation of Echoview using scripting which can drastically reduce the manual work required when processing acoustic surveys. This package plays an important role in reducing subjectivity in acoustic data processing by allowing exactly the same process to be applied automatically to multiple surveys and documenting where subjective decisions have been made. Using data from a survey of Antarctic krill, we provide two examples of using EchoviewR: krill biomass estimation and swarm detection.

The first and last surveys covered a 105 by 105 n mile study area centered on Elephant Island; the second and third surveys covered a 60 by 35 n mile area immediately north of Elephant Island. During the first survey, krill were distributed in a wide band extending along the north side of Elephant Island and wrapping around the western end; biomass was estimated to be 2.2 million metric tons (t). During the second survey, the highest densities of krill were over the shelf extending to the northwest from Elephant Island and including the Seal Island archipelago; high densities of krill also extended off the shelf from the northeast end of Elephant Island into deeper water. Biomass in the smaller survey area was estimated to be 0.7 million t. Three weeks later, high krill densities were still apparent in the vicinity of Seal Island, but the area of high density previously mapped off the northeast end of Elephant Island has diminished considerably; biomass was estimated to be 0.4 million t. During the final survey, conducted 6 wk after the first survey, krill were mapped in reduced densities primarily to the west of Elephant Island; biomass over the larger survey area had declined to 1.1 million t.																	0171-8630					SEP	1993	99	1-2					29	39		10.3354/meps099029							WOS:A1993LY00300003

In particular, seasonal changes in environmental light regimes have been shown to strongly influence krill metabolism, representing control signals for seasonal regulation of physiology of this key Southern Ocean species. Here, we report the identification of a cryptochrome gene, a cardinal component of the clockwork machinery in several organisms. EsCRY appears to be an ortholog of mammalian-like CRYs and clusters with the insect CRY2 subfamily. EsCRY has the canonical bipartite CRY structure, with a conserved N-terminal domain and a highly divergent C-terminus, that bears several binding motifs, some of them shared with insect CRY2 and others peculiar for EsCRY. We have evaluated the temporal expression of Escry both at mRNA and protein levels in individuals harvested from the Ross Sea at different times throughout the 24 h cycle during the Antarctic summer. We observed a daily fluctuation in abundance for Escry mRNA in the head, with high levels around 06: 00 h, which is not mirrored by a cycle in the corresponding protein. Our findings represent a first step toward establishing the presence of an endogenous circadian time-keeping mechanism that might allow this organism to synchronize its physiology and behavior to the Antarctic light regimes.

The krill DHA and EPA are generally considered to be similar to natural ones. However, two chemical compounds which were separated from Antarctic krill oil and identified as EPA and DHA by HRESIMS and NMR acted much more effective inhibitive activities on growth of several cell lines (U937, K562, SMMC-7721, PC-3, MDA-MB-231, HL60 and MCF-7) than those from sturgeon liver and commercial fish oil. Taking MCF-7 as an example, the IC50 values of Antarctic krill EPA and DHA were 14.01 and 19.94 mu M, while the IC50 values of sturgeon liver and commercial fish EPA and DHA were 81.45, 73.13, 82.11 and 75.31 mu M, respectively. Raman spectra revealed that the Antarctic krill EPA and DHA have E-configuration structures, which were different from those in commercial fish oil. Additionally, the Antarctic krill EPA and DHA had no effects on human normal liver cell line HL7702. These results indicated that the Antarctic krill E-EPA and E-DHA had a great prospect in cancer therapy.

J	Voronina, NM				Voronina, NM			Comparative abundance and distribution of major filter-feeders in the Antarctic pelagic zone	JOURNAL OF MARINE SYSTEMS					International JGOFS Symposium on Carbon Fluxes and Dynamic Processes in the Southern Ocean - Present and Past	AUG 28-31, 1995	BREST, FRANCE	European Inst Marine Studies, Univ W Brittany				The filter-feeding plankton, herbivorous copepods, salps and euphausiids, form the basic level of metazoans in the Antarctic pelagic trophic web. This paper sets out to determine the comparative share of these taxonomic groups in the total biomass and annual production. Their most abundant representatives, four copepod species (Calanus propinquus, Calanoides acutus, Rhincalanus gigas and Metridia gerlachei), all salps and krill Euphausia superba were studied. For the first two groups net samples from six Russian expeditions in different sectors of the Antarctic were used. In total 752 samples from 118 stations were considered. The mean fresh biomass of filter-feeding copepods in the 0-1500 m layer was 18.0 g m(-2) and in the entire Antarctic 576 10(6) t. The biomass of salps in comparatively restricted rich regions exceeded 500 g m(-2) and in the remaining area was 1.2 +/- 0.8 g m(-2), giving a total quantity of 882 10(6) t. The krill abundance estimation was based on published data, using a map of its quantitative distribution compiled from commercial trawling made by Soviet fishing and scientific ships during 17 seasons [Parfenovich, S.S., 1980. O zakonomernostyakh razmeshcheniya i regionalnoi differentsiatsii mestoskoplenii krilya v Yuzhnom Okeane. VNIRO, Moskva, in Russian.]. Three main zones based on commercial characteristics were determined by this author: (I) zone of regular occurrence of dense concentrations; (2) zone of rare occurrence of concentrations; (3) zone of low-abundance dispersed krill. All available data on E. superba biomass in the Antarctic were grouped together according to these zones and their means were calculated. The biomass of krill was found to be 60.1 +/- 11.2, 3.3 +/- 1.3 and 0.8 +/- 0.4 g m(-2) fresh mass in zones i, 2 and 3, respectively, with a total of 272 10(6) t. All estimates are compared with the literature data and their validity is discussed. For the annual production determinations the obtained biomass characteristics were multiplied by published P/B coefficients. For the copepods its value was taken as 4.4 and for krill as 0.79. The total annual production of copepods was estimated as 2534 10(6) t and that of krill as 215 10(6) t (fresh mass). Salp production could not be evaluated, for lack of a sufficient database. In terms of fresh mass, the main share of filter-feeder biomass on the entire Antarctic scale belongs to salps, due to their local maxima; the second place belongs to copepods and krill comes in the third position. But after recalculation in terms of dry mass, copepods shift to the first place and salps to the last. The annual production of copepods significantly exceeds that of krill.																	0924-7963	1879-1573				NOV	1998	17	1-4					375	390		10.1016/S0924-7963(98)00050-5							WOS:000077463500026

In Pacific white shrimp, the main changes of NRCs were in adenosine monophosphate (AMP) and inosine monophosphate (IMP). High temperature (85 and 95 degrees C) can inhibit the ATP degradation by water bath heating. In Antarctic krill, the main change of NRCs was in inosine (HxR) that decreased in microwave heating treatment at 95 degrees C. The different methods were compared in terms of IMP content and flavor/bitter ratio, which are related to flavor of aquatic products. The best heating method was pre-heating at 75 degrees C in water bath followed by microwave heating at 95 degrees C (IMP content and relatively flavor/bitter ratio were 4.34 mu mol/g and 3.00, respectively) for pacific white shrimp and pre-heating at 65 degrees C in microwave followed by water bath heating at 95 degrees C (IMP content and relatively flavor/bitter ratio were 0.18 mu mol/g and 0.06, respectively) for Antarctic krill, respectively. Chemical analysis, microbiological analysis and sensory evaluation showed that the K value is not suitable for assessing the freshness of Antarctic krill. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Here, we analyse the number of samples required to estimate the characteristics of a local population as precisely as if there were no differences between krill swarms in terms of their biological composition. Krill were intensively sampled over different spatial and temporal scales around South Georgia in 1981 and 1982, and in the Bransfield Strait in 1985. These varied from replicate hauls at a single station over 24 h and repeat sampling in restricted areas over periods of 6 to 14 d to regional surveys around South Georgia and in the Bransfield Strait. Various biological characteristics were measured such as length, maturity, moult stage and feeding state. Depending upon the biological characteristic examined and the area covered by the sampling programme, the number of samples needed to obtain the same degree of precision as would be found in the absence of heterogeneity varied from 3 to > 80 samples. This has important implications for the design of net-sampling programme for monitoring krill populations.																	0025-3162						1990	107	3					409	415		10.1007/BF01313422							WOS:A1990EP46800005

Natural krill oil has higher levels of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) in phospholipid than in triacylglycerol and so high levels of these omega-3 fatty acids in krill oil triacylglycerol was indicative of adulteration. Carbon (C-13) NMR detected adulteration of krill oil with 10% or more anchovy oil, while TLC-FID detected levels as low as 1% adulteration with EPA ethyl esters. However, positional distribution of EPA and DHA, as determined using C-13 NMR, was similar for both fish oil and krill oil, indicating that positional distribution cannot be used to show adulteration. Phosphorous (P-31) NMR spectroscopy can show adulteration with low cost sources of phospholipid but was not useful for determining adulteration of krill oil with fish oil.

Survey design, sampling protocols, and data analysis procedures are described. Mean krill density across the survey area was estimated to be 21.4 gm(-2), and total biomass was estimated to be 44.3 million tonnes (CV 11.4%). This biomass estimate leads to a revised estimate of precautionary yield for krill in the Scotia Sea of 4 million tonnes. However, before the fishery can be permitted to expand to this level, it will be necessary to establish mechanisms to avoid concentration of fishing effort, particularly near colonies of land-breeding krill predators, and to consider the effects of krill immigrating into the region from multiple sources.

J	Jackowski, E				Jackowski, E			Distribution and size of Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba Dana) in Polish commercial catches taken in the Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean from 1997 to 1999	CCAMLR SCIENCE												The distribution and internal structure of commercial krill concentrations were investigated in the areas of the South Shetland, Elephant, South Georgia and South Orkney Islands in the spring and summer from 1997 to 1999. The density of concentrations varied with area and season. The densest concentrations were found near the South Shetlands. Concentrations at night were several times less dense than those observed during the day. Between February and April the density of concentrations increased, while in May and June it decreased. From February to June the period of daylight becomes progressively shorter, therefore it must be assumed that there are factors other than daylight which have an impact on the density of krill concentrations. The internal structure of concentrations was very diverse, and mean density varied from 11 to 31 370 specimens per 1000 m(3). At night, krill concentrations were scattered throughout the water column, however no clear evidence of vertical migrations was found. Between February and April concentrations occurred in much shallower waters at night than during the day, while in May and June they occurred at the same depths at night as during the day or sometimes even deeper. Between February and April concentrations during the day were found in shallower waters, while between April and June they were found in deeper waters. The size structure of the krill varied during all periods and in all areas, however krill size was observed to decrease as the season progressed.																	1023-4063						2002	9						83	105									WOS:000179438500007

Feeding ecology and metabolism of the Antarctic cydippid ctenophore Callianira antarctica	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												The chemical composition, metabolism, and feeding ecology of the cydippid ctenophore Callianira antarctica (Chun 1897) were investigated during autumn and winter 2001 and 2002 in the vicinity of Marguerite Bay, an embayment on the western Antarctic Peninsula shelf. C. an tarctica had relatively high carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) values (average: 8.4% C and 1.8% N [% dry weight, DW]), further suggesting that polar ctenophores are more C-rich than tropical species. Winter oxygen consumption and ammonium excretion rates ranged from 0.059 to 0.411 mu l O-2 mg(-1) DW h(-1) and 0.043 to 2.22 nmol N mg(-1) DW h(-1), respectively, at 0 degrees C. Calanoid copepods, larval and juvenile Antarctic krill Euphausia superba and a mixture of prey were offered to ctenophores during feeding incubations. Ingestion rates based on preliminary feeding experiments were linearly related to prey densities, with rates ranging from 9 to 39 prey ind.(-1) d(-1) and from 3.5 to 4.0 prey ind.(-1) d(-1) for 1 larger and I smaller C. antarctica, respectively. Daily rations varied between 22 and 136% of body C for the larger ctenophore and 6 to 22 % of body C for the smaller individual. Digestion time (median: 11.5 h) was dependent on prey elemental content and prey number, and was independent of ctenophore size. Gut content analyses indicated that C. antarctica preyed predominantly on larval euphausiids and copepods. Diver observations, net collections, and diet analyses suggest that this species is an opportunistic predator that feeds both during the day and night, and appears to be well adapted to the prey patchiness found in Antarctic waters.																	0171-8630						2006	317						111	126		10.3354/meps317111							WOS:000239896600011

Prey differences drive local genetic adaptation in Antarctic fur seals	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												Antarctic fur seal (Arctocephalus gazella) colonies are found on sub-Antarctic islands around the continent. These islands experience a range of conditions in terms of physical and biological habitat, creating a natural laboratory to investigate local genetic adaptation. One striking habitat difference is in the availability of Euphausia superba krill as prey, which has led to A. gazella exhibiting a range of diets. A. gazella in some colonies consume exclusively krill, while their conspecifics in other colonies feed mainly on fish and consume few to no krill. To investigate potential adaptations to these different prey fields, reduced representation genome sequencing was conducted on A. gazella from the 8 major colonies. Twenty-seven genomic regions exhibiting signatures of natural selection were identified. Two of these genomic regions were clearly associated with seals living in krill-dominated areas or those in fish-dominated areas. Twenty-two additional genomic regions under selection showed a pattern consistent with prey differences as the driver of selection after historical migrations from krill-dominated habitats where lineages evolved to present krill-poor habitat areas were taken into account. Only 1 of the genomic regions identified appeared to be explained by any other environmental variable analysed (depth). Genomic regions under prey-driven selection included genes associated with regulation of gene expression, skeletal development, and lipid metabolism. Adaptation to local prey has implications for spatial management of this species and for the potential impacts of climate- or harvest-driven reductions in krill abundance on these seals.

Their effect on larval performance, biochemical composition and histological development was investigated. The addition of krill phospholipids, rich in highly unsaturated fatty acids, improved larval sea bream growth in terms of weight and length, enhanced hepatic utilization of dietary lipids and reduced the incidence of enterocyte injuries. These results confirm the higher nutritional value of marine phospholipids for the early development of marine fish larvae in comparison with soybean phospholipids.

Growth rate was measured using an 'instantaneous growth rate' technique which involved measuring the mean change in length of the uropods at moulting. In the first 4 d following collection mean growth rates ranged from 0.35 to 7.34 % per moult in adults and 2.42 to 9.05 % in juveniles. Mean growth rates of adult and juvenile krill differed between areas and between the different years of the investigation. When food was restricted under experimental conditions, individual krill began to shrink immediately and mean population growth rates decreased gradually, becoming negative after as little as 7 d. Populations of krill which exhibited higher initial growth rates began to shrink later than those which had initially been growing more slowly.																	0171-8630					NOV	1992	89	2-3					175	181		10.3354/meps089175							WOS:A1992KH34600007

Results are compared with aggregations detected in the Indian Ocean. Aggregations in the Atlantic were larger, closer to the surface and to each other than in the Indian Ocean. Similar patterns in the distribution of aggregation spacing along survey transects were found in the two areas, although the pattern of spacings in the Atlantic indicates differences in the scale of aggregation. Serial interdependence of aggregation variables was minimal in the Atlantic, with aggregation thickness, length and spacing showing weak inter-relationships. Weak functional association between water depth and aggregation thickness was evident. Investigation of variability in aggregation structure in relation to prevailing environmental conditions gave equivocal results and no clear association between any aggregation variable and prevailing hydrography was observed. The implications of these results for future studies on krill aggregation are discussed in relation to a conceptual framework which was developed from the present results and aimed at linking krill aggregation characteristics to environmental features.

Krill (Euphausia superba) abundance and Adelie penguin (Pygoscelis adeliae) breeding performance in the waters off the Bechervaise Island colony, East Antarctica in 2 years with contrasting ecological conditions	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY												In 2001 and 2003 small-scale acoustic surveys of Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) distribution and abundance were conducted offshore from an East Antarctic colony of Adelie penguins on Bechervaise Island (67 degrees 35'S, 62 degrees 49'E) that has been monitored for 15 years. Although the distribution of krill was similar between the two summers, their abundance in 2001 was estimated to be 3 times higher than in 2003. This biomass difference was reflected in the breeding performance of the penguins at the monitored colony. Significant differences were observed between the two seasons in foraging trip duration during chick rearing, breeding success, meal mass and dietary composition. Penguins travelled further to forage in 2003 than 2001, stayed away longer and brought back smaller meals. Fish (mostly Pleuragramma antarcticum) contributed significantly to the diet in 2003 but were only a minor component in 2001. Differences between years were particularly apparent during the late guard to early creche stages of chick rearing, coinciding with the timing of the krill survey. Chick mortality peaked during this period also. Krill demographics showed little difference between the 2 years. Oceanographically, the two summers differed; in 2003 the mixed layer was fresher and shallower, indicating a delayed melting of sea-ice in the study area when compared to 2001. Satellite observations indicated that the pack-ice directly offshore from the Mawson coast broke out earlier in 2001 and the perennial fast-ice along the coast persisted later in 2003.

Non-chromatographic screening method for the determination of mercury species. Application to the monitoring of mercury levels in Antarctic samples	TALANTA												A simple non-chromatographic method for the determination of mercury (Hg(2+)), methylmercury (MeHg(+)), dimethylmercury (Me(2)Hg), and phenylmercury (PhHg(+)) employing atomic fluorescence spectrometry (AFS) as detection technique was developed. Mercury species showed a particular behavior in the presence of several reagents. In a first stage SnCl(2) was employed for Hg(2+) determination; in a second step, [Hg(2+) + PhHg(+)] concentration was determined using SnCl(2) and UV radiation. MeHg(+) decomposition was prevented adding 2-mercaptoethanol. In a third stage, [Hg(2+) + PhHg(+) + MeHe(+)] concentration was determined using K(2)S(2)O(8). Finally, the four species were determined employing NaBH(4). Reagents concentration and flow rates were optimized. The extraction technique of mercury species involved the use of 2-mercaptoethanol as ion-pair reagent. The limits of detection for Hg(2+), PhHe(+), MeHg(+), and Me(2)Hg were 1, 40, 68, and 99 ng L(-1) with a relative standard deviation of 1.5, 3.1, 4.7 and 5.8%, respectively. Calibration curve was linear with a correlation factor equal to 0.9995. The method was successfully applied to the determination of the mercury species in two Antarctic materials: IRMM 813 (Adamussium colbecki) and MURST-ISS-A2 (Antarctic Krill). (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Krill Excretion Boosts Microbial Activity in the Southern Ocean	PLOS ONE												Antarctic krill are known to release large amounts of inorganic and organic nutrients to the water column. Here we test the role of krill excretion of dissolved products in stimulating heterotrophic bacteria on the basis of three experiments where ammonium and organic excretory products released by krill were added to bacterial assemblages, free of grazers. Our results demonstrate that the addition of krill excretion products (but not of ammonium alone), at levels expected in krill swarms, greatly stimulates bacteria resulting in an order-of-magnitude increase in growth and production. Furthermore, they suggest that bacterial growth rate in the Southern Ocean is suppressed well below their potential by resource limitation. Enhanced bacterial activity in the presence of krill, which are major sources of DOC in the Southern Ocean, would further increase recycling processes associated with krill activity, resulting in highly efficient krill-bacterial recycling that should be conducive to stimulating periods of high primary productivity in the Southern Ocean.

Stable isotope analyses (C-13/C-12 and N-15/N-14) were used to compare the dietary preferences and trophic relationships of major zooplankton species under pack ice during two winter spring transitions (2007 and 2012). During sampling, furcilia of Euphausia superba demonstrated dietary plasticity between years, herbivory when feeding on sea-ice biota, and with a more heterotrophic diet when feeding from both the sea ice and the water column. Carbon isotope signatures suggested that the pteropod Limacina helicina, small copepods Oithona spp., ostracods and amphipods relied heavily on sea ice biota. Post larval E. superba and omnivorous krill Thysanoessa macrura consumed both water column and ice biota, but further investigations are needed to estimate the contribution from each source. Large copepods and chaetognaths overwintered on a water column-based diet. Our study suggests that warm and permeable sea ice is more likely to provide food for zooplankton species under the ice than the colder ice. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

This study describes the preparation of protein isolates from oysters (OPI and HOPI) and krill (KPI and HKPI) by isoelectric solubilisation/precipitation (ISP) with or without heat pretreatment and comparatively presents their characteristics. The results showed that the solubilities of HOPI (24.08 +/- 1.94%) and HKPI (42.29 +/- 0.78%) were higher than those of OPI (13.46 +/- 0.78%) and KPI (21.71.46 +/- 1.51%), and the free and total sulphhydryl (-SH) content and surface hydrophobicity of HOPI and HKPI were higher than those of OPI and KPI, which are related to higher fat content of HOPI (10.37 +/- 0.55%) and HKPI (34.89 +/- 1.19%). SDS-PAGE and gel chromatography pattern results showed that macromolecular proteins were degraded by endogenous enzymes in OPI and KPI, while they remained unaffected in HOPI and HKPI. The FT-IR spectra showed similar patterns between OPI and HOPI and between KPI and HKPI. While the essential amino acid content was similar for OPI and HOPI (47.06 +/- 1.33% and 47.93 +/- 1.02%), that of KPI and HKPI (50.89 +/- 0.89% and 51.19 +/- 1.11%, respectively) was not significantly different.																	0950-5423	1365-2621				FEB	2021	56	2					682	691		10.1111/ijfs.14702		AUG 2020					WOS:000563908600001						
J	Bargu, S; Marinovic, B; Mansergh, S; Silver, MW				Bargu, S; Marinovic, B; Mansergh, S; Silver, MW			Feeding responses of krill to the toxin-producing diatom Pseudo-nitzschia	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY												Krill are important grazers on diatoms and critical prey items for many high level carnivores in Monterey Bay and elsewhere along the California coast. Here, some of the higher level consumers have recently been shown to be severely affected by the toxin, domoic acid (DA), a secondary metabolite of some species of the diatom Pseudo-nitzschia. To understand the potential role of krill in vectoring DA from diatoms to large predators, several grazing experiments were conducted. Field-collected Euphausia pacifica and Thysanoessa spinifera were fed on a diet of toxic and nontoxic Pseudo-nitzschia species. Gut evacuation rates of krill and CHN analysis of the algae were obtained concurrently to determine gut residence time and nutritional value of the food. Our results from a short-term (6 h) grazing experiment demonstrated that both E. pacifica and T spinifera consumed toxic Pseudo-nitzschia multiseries but the responses of the two krill species differed to a degree, with E. pacifica having the higher weight-specific feeding rate. Results from a longer-term (24 h) grazing experiment showed that E. pacifica had a different, interrupted grazing pattern and showed no immediate ill effects when consuming toxic P. multiseries as contrasted with its more constant feeding pattern on non-toxic Pseudo-nitzschia pungens. We show that toxin loads in krill digestive tracts, estimated from feeding rates and gut residence time measured here, match the observed body burdens of DA measured in field-collected krill during toxic blooms. Such data are important for predicting toxin transfer from krill to higher trophic levels during blooms of toxic algae. As an example of this transfer, we show the vulnerability of a krill-feeding seabird, Cassin's Auklet (Ptychoramphus aleuticus) to DA likely vectored by krill during toxic Pseudo-nitzschia blooms.

The food spectrum in the stomachs was analysed using traditional taxonomic methods and biochemical techniques. The vertical migration behaviour of krill was monitored through a 30 h series of net samples, whilst the trophic environment was characterised through accompanying quantitative analyses on the depth distribution and biomass of copepods and phytoplankton. Krill was found to be more carnivorous in the Kattegat than in the Clyde Sea, which correlated with the higher ratio of copepod to phytoplankton biomass found in the Kattegat compared with the Clyde Sea. High levels of fatty alcohols and other lipid markers in the stomach contents of Kattegat krill were also indicative of a carnivorous diet. Other food sources included detritus, terrestrial material and other euphausiids, underlining the opportunistic nature of northern krill in its choice of prey items. Analyses of stomach and intestinal fullness over a diel cycle showed significant variations with time in the Clyde Sea but not in the Kattegat. However, a diel cycle in the rate of ingestion was evident at both locations when comparing the copepod mandibles in the stomachs to the distribution of copepods in the environment. The fact that deep-living Calanus was not a major prey item suggested that there was little feeding activity during the daytime, when the krill occupied the deeper layers. Instead. the majority of mandibles were from species that were dominant in the upper layers, e.g, the genera Temora and Pseudocalanus. The fact that kriIl caught in the daytime contained the same relative composition of mandibles in the stomach as those caught at night is probably explained by a cessation in daytime feeding activity and retention of the mandibles from the night before. It is proposed that krill in the Clyde Sea area and the Kattegat show a diel rhythm in feeding activity that is believed to be an adaptive response to minimising predation risk.

J	Plum, C; Hillebrand, H; Moorthi, S				Plum, Christoph; Hillebrand, Helmut; Moorthi, Stefanie			Krill vs salps: dominance shift from krill to salps is associated with higher dissolved N:P ratios	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS												Pronounced atmospheric and oceanic warming along the West Antarctic Peninsula (WAP) has resulted in abundance shifts in populations of Antarctic krill and Salpa thompsoni determined by changes in the timing of sea-ice advance, the duration of sea-ice cover and food availability. Krill and salps represent the most important macrozooplankton grazers at the WAP, but differ profoundly in their feeding biology, population dynamics and stoichiometry of excretion products with potential consequences for the relative availability of dissolved nitrogen and phosphorus. Alternation of the dissolved nutrient pool due to shifts in krill and salp densities have been hypothesized but never explicitly tested by using observational data. We therefore used the Palmer LTER dataset in order to investigate whether the dominance of either grazer is related with the observed dissolved nitrogen:phosphorus (N:P) ratios at the WAP. Across the whole sampling grid, the dominance of salps over krill was significantly correlated to higher concentrations of both N and P as well as a higher N:P ratios. Using actual long-term data, our study shows for the first time that changes in key grazer dominance may have consequences for the dynamics of dissolved nitrogen and phosphorus at the WAP.																	2045-2322					APR 3	2020	10	1							5911	10.1038/s41598-020-62829-8							WOS:000563492400005	32246093					
J	Calise, L; Knutsen, T				Calise, Lucio; Knutsen, Tor			Multifrequency target strength of northern krill (Meganyctiphanes norvegica) swimming horizontally	ICES JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE												Multifrequency acoustic measurements on ex situ horizontally swimming krill were made in a novel experimental setting. An ensemble of northern krill (Meganyctiphanes norvegica) was introduced to a large enclosure (a mesocosm), and acoustic backscatter was sampled using a multifrequency (70, 120, and 200 kHz) echosounder (Simrad EK60). Two submerged lamps were placed at opposite sides of the mesocosm and switched on and off to induce the krill, by light attraction, to swim horizontally through the acoustic beams. By tracking echoes, animal displacement, swimming speed, and target strength (TS) by frequency were estimated. The dominant and secondary modes of the total-length distribution were 21.8 +/- 3.0 and 27.8 +/- 2.7 mm, respectively. Although krill orientation was assumed stable and the ping rate was high, the range and inter-ping variability of the average TS values were large, decreasing and increasing with frequency, respectively. The overall TS frequency response observed and concurrent measurements at 120 and 200 kHz confirm the theoretical expectation that the acoustic backscatter from the investigated organisms were confined to the Rayleigh and Geometric scattering regions, a finding that might both aid acoustic identification and size-group separation of in situ northern krill.

Antarctic krill and salps generally display pronounced spatial segregation at all spatial scales. This appears to be the result of a clear biotopical separation of these key species in the Antarctic pelagic food web. Krill and salps are found in different water masses or water mass modifications, which are separated by primary or secondary frontal features. On the small-scale (<100 km), Antarctic krill and salps are usually restricted to the specific water parcels, or are well segregated vertically. Krill and salp grazing rates estimated using the in situ gut fluorescence technique are among the highest recorded in the Antarctic pelagic food web. Although krill and salps at times may remove the entire daily primary production, generally their grazing impact is moderate (less than or equal to50% of primary production). The regional ecological consequences of years of high salp densities may be dramatic. If the warming trend, which is observed around the Antarctic Peninsula and in the Southern Ocean, continues, salps may become a more prominent player in the trophic structure of the Antarctic marine ecosystem. This likely would be coupled with a dramatic decrease in krill productivity, because of a parallel decrease in the spatial extension of the krill biotope. The high Antarctic regions, particularly the Marginal Ice Zone, have, however, effective physiological mechanisms that may provide protection against the salp invasion. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

This fact has led to the development of sustainable and functional diets as part of a management strategy to reduce the effects on fish growth performance and health derived from low FM/FO dietary contents. In this sense, Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) is considered a potential candidate in dietary inclusions to potentiate fish growth and health status. In this study, European sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax) were fed a practical diet with either a 15% fishmeal content (KM0; control diet) or the same diet substituted by 30% (KM5; 50 g KM/kg diet) or 50% (KM7.5; 75 g KM/kg diet) Antarctic krill meal (KM) for 12 weeks in triplicates. At the end of the feeding trial, growth performance, liver morphology, liver proximate composition, lipid classes and fatty acid profiles, as well as the expression of hepatic genes related with lipid metabolism were evaluated. Fish fed KM-based diets presented higher (p 0.05) final weight, protein and lipid efficiency ratios, specific growth rate (SGR) and improved feed conversion ratio (FCR), irrespective of the KM dietary level. Whole body and muscle proximate composition and fatty acid profiles were similar among dietary groups. Livers of European sea bass fed the experimental diets presented similar (p 0.05) biochemical composition and fatty acid profile. However, smaller hepatocellular area and lower grade of cytoplasm vacuolization as well as a better alignment around sinusoidal spaces were found. The analyses of liver lipid classes revealed a positive correlation between the level of dietary KM and the pigmented material such as astaxanthin and free fatty acid content, as well as a negative correlation with the cholesterol levels. The expression of hepatic genes studied demonstrated a downregulation of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase (hmgr) and delta-6-desaturase (fads2) expression levels in fish fed KM-based diets. Besides, gene expression levels of fatty acid binding protein 7 (fabp7) and lipoprotein lipase (lpl) were significantly correlated with KM dietary levels. Altogether, these results profile KM as a potential promoter of growth and liver health in European sea bass fed low fish meal and oil diets.				montero, daniel/ABE-3894-2020	montero, daniel/0000-0002-4358-2157												0044-8486	1873-5622				DEC 15	2021	545								737166	10.1016/j.aquaculture.2021.737166							WOS:000691819600007

One of them was purified to be homogeneous in disc electrophoresis. The amount of reducing sugars produced from laminaran with this enzyme reaction considerably exceeded the amount of liberated glucose. The enzyme hydrolyzed the periodate-oxidized and reduced laminaran. The enzyme also hydrolyzed laminarioligosaccharides except laminaribiose. However, the enzyme could not hydrolyze (1 --> 3)-beta-:(1 --> 4)-beta-D-glucan such as barley glucan and lichenan. These findings indicate that this enzyme belongs to the classes of (1 --> 3)-beta-D-glucan glucanohydrolase (EC 3.2.1.39). This enzyme hydrolyzed laminaritriose, but the enzymes classified to EC 3.2.1.39 were reported to have no ability to hydrolyze laminaritriose. Therefore, 1,3-beta-D-glucan glucanohydrolase isolated in this study has a new property in this respect.																	0021-5392					SEP	1992	58	9					1693	1698									WOS:A1992JT00500017

The 2009-2017 acoustic time series analysis revealed that krill distribution, mainly located on the continental shelf edge, was driven by the presence of fronts and submarine canyons. On the other hand, areas of persistent krill distribution included from Cape La Nao to the eastern part of Almeria Bay, although an interannual northwards increase of krill presence had been detected in 2015-2017 likely related to the position of the Balearic front. We provide information on the aggregation characteristics and biological parameters of three krill species, Nyctiphanes couchii, Nematoscelis megalops and Meganyctiphanes norvegica. N. couchii and N. megalops formed patchy pelagic aggregations in the neritic and oceanic zone, respectively, and they were the most common species in the net tows. By contrast, M. norvegica formed a large demersal aggregation on the continental shelf edge and was only found in 2017; nevertheless, its 861-kg catch represented a unique milestone in the Mediterranean. Finally, krill species shared distribution area with Maurolicus muelleri; thus, coexistence between them are also described.																	0142-7873	1464-3774				JUL	2019	41	4					491	505		10.1093/plankt/fbz030							WOS:000493563200011

The main objectives of this study were: (i) to investigate the effect of thermal treatment on these two reactions in krill products during their manufacturing process; and (ii) to understand and postulate the possible mechanisms for non-enzymatic browning reactions in krill products. Characterisation of krill products at different stages was obtained by determination of their lipid composition (lipid classes and phospholipids), antioxidant (-tocopherol and astaxanthin esters) and volatile profiles (degradation products from lipid oxidation and Strecker degradation). The use of thermal treatment resulted in lipid oxidation and subsequently led to the development of non-enzymatic browning reactions in krill products during their manufacturing process. It is hypothesized that non-enzymatic browning reactions in krill products might occur through Maillard reaction or lipid peroxidation pathways. Practical applications: The quality of krill products is influenced by the temperature used during their manufacturing process, and the occurrence of their degradative reactions is influenced by the chemical composition and matrix of krill products. This work provides information about the possible mechanisms of the two most commonly found reactions in the food system namely, lipid oxidation and non-enzymatic browning reactions. This information is not only applicable to krill products but also to other food matrices containing lipid, protein, sugar, etc.				Jacobsen, Charlotte/C-3678-2008	Jacobsen, Charlotte/0000-0003-3540-9669; Ale, Marcel Tutor/0000-0001-6417-0891												1438-7697	1438-9312				APR	2015	117	4					411	420		10.1002/ejlt.201400280							WOS:000352572800001

Antarctic sea ice change and variability - Physical and ecological implications	POLAR SCIENCE												Although Antarctic sea ice is undergoing a slight increase in overall extent, major regional changes are occurring in its spatio-temporal characteristics (most notably in sea ice seasonality). Biologically significant aspects of Antarctic sea ice are evaluated, emphasising the importance of scale and thermodynamics versus dynamics. Changing sea ice coverage is having major direct and indirect though regionally-dependent effects on ecosystem structure and function, with the most dramatic known effects to date occurring in the West Antarctic Peninsula region. There is mounting evidence that loss of sea ice has affected multiple levels of the marine food web in a complex fashion and has triggered cascading effects. Impacts on primary production, Antarctic krill, fish, marine mammals and birds are assessed, and are both negative and positive. The review includes recent analysis of change/variability in polynyas and fast ice, and also highlights the significance of extreme events (which have paradoxical impacts). Possible future scenarios are investigated in the light of the predicted decline in sea ice by 2100 e.g. increased storminess/waviness, numbers of icebergs and snowfall. Our current lack of knowledge on many aspects of sea ice-related change and biological response is emphasised. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. and NIPR. All rights reserved.

We aimed to test whether static no-take zones within a large, sustainable-use MPA prevented overlap between gentoo penguins and a krill fishery during two winters with contrasting prey fields. LOCATION: South Georgia, Southwest Atlantic Ocean. METHOD: We used satellite tracking (N = 16, June-September 2018) to describe gentoo penguin movements and distribution and quantified their overlap with the MPA's no-take zone (NTZ) and the krill fishing grounds. DNA metabarcoding of scats (N = 220, April-September 2018) was used to quantify diet. RESULTS: When krill were at moderate densities and evenly distributed in 2001, gentoo penguins would have spent all of their time within the 12 NM NTZ, but when availability was low in 2018, they spent 46.3% of their time outside the NTZ and 9.6% within the krill fishing grounds. The extension of the NTZ to 30 km in response to this finding would have produced a 14.9% increase in protection for penguins and displaced 4% of fishery hauls. Gentoo penguin diet comprised 25.8% krill, which is lower than in the late 1980s but more than in 2009. MAIN CONCLUSIONS: Gentoo penguins extend their foraging range when krill is scarce, which increases the potential for spatial overlap with the krill fishery during periods of nutritional stress. Current regulations allow for expansion of both extent and catches by the krill fishery and, should this occur, gentoo penguins may face heightened risks from competition. A dynamic ocean management framework, that extends closed areas in response to near real-time data on penguin movements and krill density estimates, may reduce the potential for competition in this sustainable-use MPA while allowing a profitable krill fishery.

J	Casaux, R; Barrera-Oro, E				Casaux, Ricardo; Barrera-Oro, Esteban			Dietary overlap in inshore notothenioid fish from the Danco Coast, western Antarctic Peninsula	POLAR RESEARCH												We carried out a dietary overlap analysis between notothenioid species by examining the stomach contents of more than 900 specimens collected in a fish assemblage at the Danco Coast, western Antarctic Peninsula, in the summer of 2000. Prey reoccurrences among fish species were 32.2%, with krill Euphausia superba, salps and the gammaridean Prostebeingia longicornis the most reoccurring prey. The diet similarity between species pairs was lower than 55%, in accordance with similar fish assemblages in the South Orkney Islands, the South Shetland Islands and the Antarctic Peninsula. Whereas at those localities the higher prey overlap was between krill-feeding fish species, at the Danco Coast it was between Trematomus bernacchii and Lepidonotothen nudifrons, Notothenia coriiceps and Notothenia rossii, Notothenia coriiceps and Parachaenichthyis charcoti, and Trematomus newnesi and Notothenia rossii, which shared primarily gammaridean amphipods, algae, fish and krill, respectively. Krill is normally the main prey of fish in summer in inshore waters of the western Antarctic Peninsula, but its density in January/February 2000 was notably lower than in previous years. Therefore, at the Danco Coast, under conditions of krill shortage, most of the notothenioid species foraged more intensively on alternative prey, such as gammarideans, fish and algae. The difference between areas in the pattern of dietary overlap might be related to differences in prey availability between years and to the degree of competition for targeted prey.																	0800-0395	1751-8369					2013	32								21319	10.3402/polar.v32i0.21319							WOS:000325892900001

Two-frequency acoustic backscatter data was examined in the austral summers of January 2011 and February 2012. A dB identification window (Sv120-38) identified ice krill dominating the acoustic backscatter. The density of ice krill, calculated with the stochastic distorted-wave born approximation model, ranged between 4.5 and 30 g wet mass m(-2) for each transect (a mean of 16 g wet mass m(-2) for all transects), these high values are an order of magnitude higher than recorded previously in the Ross Sea Polynya. High densities were detected along the ice shelf and near the boundary between pack ice and coastal polynya, and we postulate that these could be important habitats for ice krill. The high densities observed along the transects make ice krill a potentially important, but poorly known contributor to these high-latitude shelf food webs. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Since natural materials generally pose a low risk to both the human health and the environment owing to their biodegradability, the wastewater released from their manufacturing processes is less polluting, and therefore, it requires less resources and energy for treatment compared to wastewater loaded with synthetic substances. Herein, we report the use of a protein by-product recovered from the oil extraction process of Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) to replace traditional mordanting agents in the dyeing of cotton with tannin-rich natural dye extracted from the bark of Xylocarpus granatum. Antarctic krill protein pretreatment successfully improved the dyeability of the fabrics through the formation of insoluble complexes between the protein and tannin. The color parameters of the dyed samples were measured based on the CIE L*a*b* system. The obtained reddish-brown fabrics exhibited mostly good to excellent color fastness ratings in response to washing and other wet treatments. They also displayed durable UV protection properties, with the UPF rating reaching the maximum (50+) level, despite being washed for 50 cycles. Both the Antarctic krill protein and tannin contributed to improved UV protection efficiency due to the presence of UV-absorbing moieties and slight changes in the resulting fabric thickness and cover factor.

After 52 and 41 days of nursery in outdoor and indoor tanks, no statistical effect from the inclusion of AKO and AKO with HPK was observed on final mean survival (84.0%-91.8%), gained yield (1,568-1,611 g/m(3)), daily growth (14.2-14.2 mg/day) and feed conversion ratio (1.70-0.89), respectively. However, final shrimp BW was significantly improved with 50.0 g/kg AKO (775 mg) and 30.0 g/kg AKO with 80.0 g/kg HPK (629 mg), respectively, compared with control groups (711 and 567 mg). Resistance to osmotic and thermal stress was significantly increased with 10.0 g/kg AKO. Enhancement in growth performance and resistance may be related to a higher supply of dietary EPA, DHA and astaxanthin resulting from the inclusion of AKO and HPK.																	1353-5773	1365-2095				APR	2021	27	2					327	341		10.1111/anu.13187		NOV 2020					WOS:000587320400001

Potential energy gain by whales outside of the Antarctic: prey preferences and consumption rates of migrating humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae)	POLAR BIOLOGY												The humpback whale (Megaptera novaeangliae) makes annual migrations from Antarctic feeding grounds to tropical breeding grounds. The extent to which it feeds during migration is unknown, but thought to be very low. Whether an animal feeds during migration is likely dependent on prey availability and on the ease with which it can capture the available prey. This study used digital tags (DTAGs) and concurrent prey sampling to measure how changes in the depth and type of prey influenced the lunge feeding rates and the amount of energy consumed by migrating humpback whales. Whales targeting krill lunged at significantly higher rates than whales targeting fish; however, the depth of the prey did not influence lunge rate. The observed lunge rates when feeding on krill, to the best of our knowledge, are higher than any previously reported rates of whales feeding. Estimates of the energetic content of the prey ingested revealed that whales may consume between 1.2 and 3.4 times their daily energy requirements per day while feeding on krill during migration, but less when feeding on fish. This suggests that whales may begin to restock energy supplies prior to reaching the Antarctic. Determining how often this high rate of energy intake occurs along the migratory route will assist with understanding the contribution of migratory energy intake to annual energy budgets.

Krill as a central node for iron cycling in the Southern Ocean	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS												In order to establish the potential role of Antarctic krill ( Euphausia superba) in the recycling of bioactive elements, we have quantified the release of iron, phosphate, and ammonia by these organisms along the Antarctic Peninsula sector of the Southern Ocean. The experimental results suggested that the presence of krill has a significant impact on ambient iron concentrations, as large amounts of this trace element were released by the krill ( 22 - 689 nmol Fe g Dry Weight(-1) h(-1), equivalent to 0.2 to 4.3 nmol Fe L-1 d(-1)). Half of this iron release occurred within the first hour of the experiment, and differences in iron and phosphate release rates (3.1 to 14.0 mu mol PO43- g DW-1 h(-1)) seemed to reflect differences in food availability.

J	Tenuta, A; Alvarenga, RCC				Tenuta, A; Alvarenga, RCC			Reduction of the bioavailability of fluoride from Antarctic krill by calcium	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF FOOD SCIENCES AND NUTRITION												The bioavailability of fluoride from krill exoskeleton and the effect of additional calcium on the bioavailability of fluoride from krill paste were evaluated using young rats. Fluoride from the exoskeleton showed a high apparent absorption of 80%. Approximately 3.6% of this fluoride was deposited in the femur, and 44% in the rest of the carcass. The presence of 1.5% and 2.5% calcium (CaCO3) in the diet - 1.0 and 2.0% above the minimum recommended content respectively significantly reduced the bioavailability of fluoride from krill paste. The apparent absorption of fluoride from the paste was reduced by 33.8 and 45.8%, deposition in the femur by 48.1 and 58%, and retention in the rest of the carcass by 44.4 and 55.6%, respectively. The need for further studies using lower amounts of fluoride and calcium and other chemical forms of calcium is indicated.																	0963-7486					JUL	1999	50	4					297	302									WOS:000081712200009	10719576

J	Tanasichuk, RW				Tanasichuk, RW			Interannual variations in the population biology and productivity of Euphausia pacifica in Barkley Sound, Canada, with special reference to the 1992 and 1993 warm ocean years	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												I monitored the size composition, abundance, growth, reproductive biomass and productivity characteristics of Euphausia pacifica in Barkley Sound, Canada, from March 1991 through March 1997. Sea temperatures were anomalously warm in 1992 (El Nino Southern Oscillation, ENSO) and in 1993; the strongest upwelling over the study period occurred in 1992. Mean annual E. pacifica larval abundance was 6 times greater in 1992 than in 1991, the pre-ENSO year. Adult abundance in 1992 and 1993 was twice that for 1991 due to the strong recruitment moving through the population. Larval abundance fluctuated substantially since the warming while adult abundance returned to pre-ENSO levels in 1994. Growth conditions, as indicated by variations in the condition factor, did not vary significantly over the 6 yr study period. Length-at-maturity increased over the spawning season but interannual variations were too small to influence adult abundance. The sex ratio fluctuated randomly around a grand mean of 0.56 males within and between years. I present a procedure for defining spawning events as a function of larval development time and its variability. I found a number of discrete spawnings annually and suggest that there has been no change in spawning frequency or duration over the study period. I found no significant change in the size of any larval stage over the study period. The relationship between parental and larval abundance follows a Ricker stock-recruit relationship; larval abundance decreased at high parental abundances. Mean annual larval biomass and productivity (growth + moult) ranged from being the same as to 9 times greater than 1991 levels. Mean,adult biomass was 1.2 and 2 times greater in 1992 and 1993 respectively than in 1991; productivity was 1.8 and 2.3 times higher in 1992 and 1993 respectively and has returned to pre-ENSO levels. P:B ratios for total production ranged from 55 to 89 and from 8.6 to 12.4 for larvae and adults respectively. Population P:B ratios fluctuated between 10.7 and 23.3.																	0171-8630	1616-1599					1998	173						163	180		10.3354/meps173163							WOS:000077093600014

The experimental parameters of LID are optimized by response surface methodology (RSM), and the optima are obtained as follows; laser power (10 W), irradiation time (5 min), and sample volume (3 g). The results show that a total of 41 volatile molecular species are detected, including six alcohols, 10 aldehydes, five ketones, 14 hydrocarbons, and six other compounds. Compared with the conventional heating assisted desorption technique, the LID can release volatile molecular species with higher abundance in a considerably reduced extraction time from 30 to 5 min. Finally, the proposed method is validated in terms of sensitivity, precision, linearity, and recovery, which demonstrate its advantages of high efficiency and simplified procedure. Practical Applications: An LID method is developed using a 450 nm blue semiconductor laser for analyzing the flavor of Antarctic krill oil (E. superba). Compared with the conventional heating assisted desorption technique, the LID can release more volatile molecular species with higher abundance in a considerably shorter extraction time, and the intensive laser power does not induce the autoxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acids. It shows the advantages of a highly efficient, and simplified procedure.																	1438-7697	1438-9312				APR	2019	121	4							1800446	10.1002/ejlt.201800446							WOS:000462920600019

The proportion of green krill (individuals discoloured due to active feeding on phytoplankton) had significant regressions with chlorophyll-a concentrations in micro- and nano-size fractions. Between these two fractions, chlorophyll-a concentration in the micro-size fraction showed the higher partial regression coefficient. This result shows the importance of phytoplankton larger than nano-phytoplankton, especially micro-phytoplankton, in terms of a phytoplanktonic food source for Antarctic krill in the natural environment.

The key species Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) has evolved metabolic and behavioural seasonal rhythms to cope with these seasonal changes. We investigate the switch between a physiological less active and active period for adult krill, a rhythm which seems to be controlled by internal biological clocks. These biological clocks can be synchronized by environmental triggers such as day length and food availability. They have evolved for particular environmental regimes to synchronize predictable seasonal environmental changes with important life cycle functions of the species. In a changing environment the time when krill is metabolically active and the time of peak food availability may not overlap if krill's seasonal activity is solely determined by photoperiod (day length). This is especially true for the Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean where the spatio-temporal ice cover dynamics are changing substantially with rising average temperatures. We developed an individual-based model for krill to explore the impact of photoperiod and food availability on the growth and demographics of krill. We simulated dynamics of local krill populations (with no movement of krill assumed) along a south-north gradient for different triggers of metabolic activity and different levels of food availability below the ice. We also observed the fate of larval krill which cannot switch to low metabolism and therefore are likely to overwinter under ice. Krill could only occupy the southern end of the gradient, where algae bloom only lasts for a short time, when alternative food supply under the ice was high and metabolic activity was triggered by photoperiod. The northern distribution was limited by lack of overwintering habitat for krill larvae due to short duration of sea ice cover even for high food content under the ice. The variability of the krill's length-frequency distributions varied for different triggers of metabolic activity, but did not depend on the sea ice extent. Our findings suggest a southward shift of krill populations due to reduction in the spatial sea ice extent, which is consistent with field observations. Overall, our results highlight the importance of the explicit consideration of spatio-temporal sea ice dynamics especially for larval krill together with temporal synchronization through internal clocks, triggered by environmental factors (photoperiod and food) in adult krill for the population modelling of krill.

J	Kristjansdottir, S; Gudmundsdottir, A				Kristjansdottir, S; Gudmundsdottir, A			Propeptide dependent activation of the Antarctic krill euphauserase precursor produced in yeast	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF BIOCHEMISTRY												Euphauserase is a brachyurin type digestive enzyme isolated from Antarctic krill. The brachyurins belong to dan SA of the S1 family of serine endopeptidases. In this study, we demonstrate that the precursor form of recombinant euphauserase, termed pro-r-euphauserase, can be successfully expressed in Pichia pastoris. The presence of most of the 51-residue euphauserase propeptide is essential during expression, under the growth conditions of Pichia. The propeptide may be required either for correct folding or processing of the enzyme. Cod trypsin generates a fully active r-euphauserase from its precursor, which appears to be identical to the native enzyme. The mature r-euphauserase sequence contains 250 amino-acid residues including a 13-residue activation peptide, which seems to be attached to the molecule by a disulfide bond. Euphauserase shares an average sequence identity of 62% with its type I brachyurin analogue, crab collagenase I. However, the identity between these two sequences is much higher in the regions shown to be important for the broad substrate specificity and collagen binding of crab collagenase I. The type I brachyurins share only 30-40% identities with the type II brachyurins and trypsins. The low isoelectric point of euphauserase, with a calculated pi value of 3.9, is typical for the type I brachyurins.																	0014-2956					MAY	2000	267	9					2632	2639		10.1046/j.1432-1327.2000.01273.x							WOS:000087108400020	10785384

DISCOVERY 2010: Spatial and temporal variability in a dynamic polar ecosystem	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY												The Scotia Sea has been a focus of biological- and physical oceanographic study since the Discovery expeditions in the early 1900s. It is a physically energetic region with some of the highest levels of productivity in the Southern Ocean. It is also a region within which there have been greater than average levels of change in upper water column temperature. We describe the results of three cruises transecting the central Scotia Sea from south to north in consecutive years and covering spring, summer and autumn periods. We also report on some community level syntheses using both current-day and historical data from this region. A wide range of parameters were measured during the field campaigns, covering the physical oceanography of the region, air-sea CO2 fluxes, macro- and micronutrient concentrations, the composition and biomass of the nano-, micro- and mesoplankton communities, and the distribution and biomass of Antarctic krill and mesopelagic fish. Process studies examined the effect of iron-stress on the physiology of primary producers, reproduction and egestion in Antarctic krill and the transfer of stable isotopes between trophic layers, from primary consumers up to birds and seals. Community level syntheses included an examination of the biomass-spectra, food-web modelling, spatial analysis of multiple trophic layers and historical species distributions. The spatial analyses in particular identified two distinct community types: a northern warmer water community and a southern cold community, their boundary being broadly consistent with the position of the Southern Antarctic Circumpolar Current Front (SACCF). Temperature and ice cover appeared to be the dominant, over-riding factors in driving this pattern. Extensive phytoplankton blooms were a major feature of the surveys, and were persistent in areas such as South Georgia. In situ and bioassay measurements emphasised the important role of iron inputs as facilitators of these blooms. Based on seasonal DIC deficits, the South Georgia bloom was found to contain the strongest seasonal carbon uptake in the ice-free zone of the Southern Ocean. The surveys also encountered low-production, iron-limited regions, a situation more typical of the wider Southern Ocean. The response of primary and secondary consumers to spatial and temporal heterogeneity in production was complex. Many of the life-cycles of small pelagic organisms showed a close coupling to the seasonal cycle of food availability. For instance, Antarctic krill showed a dependence on early, non-ice-associated blooms to facilitate early reproduction. Strategies to buffer against environmental variability were also examined, such as the prevalence of multiyear life-cycles and variability in energy storage levels. Such traits were seen to influence the way in which Scotia Sea communities were structured, with biomass levels in the larger size classes being higher than in other ocean regions. Seasonal development also altered trophic function, with the trophic level of higher predators increasing through the course of the year as additional predator-prey interactions emerged in the lower trophic levels. Finally, our studies re-emphasised the role that the simple phytoplankton-krill-higher predator food chain plays in this Southern Ocean region, particularly south of the SACCF. To the north, alternative food chains, such as those involving copepods, macrozooplankton and mesopelagic fish, were increasingly important. Continued ocean warming in this region is likely to increase the prevalence of such alternative suchfood chains with Antarctic krill predicted to move southwards. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Population estimates based on multi-ship acoustic surveys have been used to set catch limits. More localized acoustic surveys have been conducted to study the response of land-breeding krill predators to local variations in their food supply. These and future surveys may result in additional controls on the fishery. In this context, the use of acoustics to survey euphausiids is reviewed and major sources of uncertainty are discussed. These issues are organized as they pertain to the two broad steps of acoustic surveys: (1) estimating the volumetric density of krill (measurement uncertainty) and (2) mapping krill distribution and estimating abundance (sampling uncertainty).

The analysis reviewed and updated krill density and proportional recruitment indices. Krill absolute recruitment and biomass from net sampling surveys are introduced as additional indices from this time series. New survey results from the past two seasons indicate a very successful 1994/1995 year-class and slightly below average proportional recruitment of the 1995/1996 krill year-class. Absolute recruitment of the 1995/1996 year-class was high compared to preceding years, because total stock size was relatively high in 1996/1997. After a period of low krill density and biomass in the area for almost a decade, krill density and biomass have increased. Caution is expressed as to whether this observed increase represents a long-term recovery of the stock.																	0722-4060					JUN	1998	19	6					393	398		10.1007/s003000050264							WOS:000073931800004

The time courses of the activities of endo- and exochitinase in the stomach and the midgut gland were compared with those of the digestive enzymes protease, cellulase (1,4-beta-D-glucanase) and laminarinase (1,3-beta-D-glucanase). Specific activities of all enzymes were higher in the stomach than in the midgut gland. Characteristic time courses of activity were evident after 4 days. In starved animals, enzyme activities decreased to a minimum after 4 days and recovered within 14 days to initial values. In the stomach, the activities of endo- and exochitinase increased when krill were fed on Cyclotella. For animals fed with Dunaliella, activities stayed constant or decreased slightly. The results confirm chitinases as digestive enzymes and, therefore, the capability of krill to utilize various food sources.

In the Northern krill, Meganyctiphanes norvegica (M. Sars), female krill produce eggs cyclically. Spawning moult cycles alternate with vitellogenic moult cycles for lipid yolk accumulation. Histology shows that lipids are associated with the R cells of the digestive gland in both sexes, with the yolk platelets of mature oocytes and with the fat body cell membranes and blood lacunae in reproducing females. Mature female krill can have a total lipid content twice as high as males, mostly due to accumulation in the ovary, the fat body and the haemolymph. In contrast, in males, as well as in non-reproducing females, the highest percentage of lipids is found in the digestive gland and the haemolymph. In Meganyctiphanes norvegica, the most abundant lipid fractions are polar lipids and triglycerides, the latter being relatively low in reproducing female gonad and fat body. Triglycerides are believed to be a pure energy source and polar lipids are essential for membrane development in embryos. The fatty acid content and composition of the triglyceride and polar lipid fractions in females are different from males, related to both reproductive and dietary processes. Higher levels of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) in the polar lipid fraction were found in reproductive females. During the non-reproductive season, the converse was found, indicating the specific role PUFA and other fatty acids play in growth and egg production. Adaptive processes linked to reproduction were studied comparatively in three populations of the Northern krill - Clyde Sea (W, Scotland), Kattegat (E, Denmark), Ligurian Sea (Mediterranean) - all differing considerably in climatic and trophic conditions. Such adjustments in lipid synthesis and storage are viewed as reproductive strategies developed by the Northern krill in response to different environmental conditions.

A future decline of ice melt-induced stability of the water column may be associated with a shift in dominant food webs, from larger, sun-adapted diatoms grazed by euphausiids to smaller, shade-adapted flagellates consumed by salps. A basically one-dimensional numerical model of three dominant groups of the Antarctic phytoplankton community (diatoms, cryptophytes, and colonial prymnesiophytes) and four types of herbivore (protozoans, salps, copepods, and euphausiids) is used to explore the seasonal importance of both light limitation and grazing pressure on the amount of annual carbon sequestration and larval krill survival within contrasting oceanic and neritic waters, where respective validation data have been gathered during austral spring by the European JGOFS and RACER programs. With imposition of moderate and large grazing stresses, thought to be typical of offshore waters, we were able to replicate the European JGOFS 1992 observations of light penetration, phytoplankton biomass, primary production, pCO(2), bacterial biomass, labile DOG, ammonium, and total particle effluxes at 100 m within the deep SML of our model. The fidelity of such a large set of simulated state variables suggests that multiple limiting factors are indeed operating on different components of the oceanic phytoplankton community - selective grazing losses on the flagellates, but light limitation of diatoms. Release of protozoan grazing pressure in our model instead leads to unobserved spring blooms of cryptophytes, found only in laboratory enclosures. On an annual basis, weak sequestration of atmospheric CO2 is simulated in a habitat typical of the Polar Front, while evasion of carbon dioxide occurs under biophysical conditions of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current. Stratification in shallow SML and the same absolute grazing demands by krill and copepods allows sun-adapted diatoms of our model to bloom at the expense of shade-adapted cryptophytes and prymnesiophytes, eaten by salps and protozoans. We were also able to replicate RACER-I observations of the same suite of variables in 1986-1987, as well as the observed 10-fold range of detrital fluxes caught by other sediment trap deployments during 1980 and 1983 along the Antarctic Peninsula. In western Bransfield Strait, coastal waters are a strong sink for atmospheric CO2 within parcels of Bellingshausen Sea origin, but not perhaps in those from the Weddell Sea, which resemble the oceanic regime of deep SML. We conclude that even in shallow neritic SML. some protozoan rivals of larval krill must still crop flagellates to ensure sufficient abundance of diatom food for both euphausiid survival and possible clogging of the mucous nets of other salp rivals.

Time budgets and at-sea behaviour of lactating female Antarctic fur seals Arctocephalus gazella at Bouvetoya	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												We present the first data on attendance patterns, at-sea movements and (living behaviour of Antarctic fur seals breeding at Bouvetoya (Bouvet Island), Southern Ocean, While other colonies have been extensively studied, this remote and second largest global population remains relatively unknown. Time depth recorders and satellite relay data loggers were deployed on breeding females during the 2000-2001 and 2001-2002 Summers. Attendance and foraging patterns were similar to those observed at colonies in the Scotia Sea region where Antarctic krill Euphausia superba is the predominant prey. Early to mid-lactation trips ranged within similar to 100 km of the island, usually towards the west; the dominant direction shifted later in the season and the range also increased markedly to a peak between early February and early March. Solar elevation influenced arrivals and departures from the island, with most departures occurring around sunset. Diurnal variations in diving behaviour were consistent with the vertical migration of krill. Diving frequency was high er at night and diving effort peaked around morning twilight, Afternoon deep diving was common, suggesting that females might target dense daytime krill aggregations between the photic zone and the thermocline. Trip durations increased throughout early to mid-lactation, peaking in late January to early March, before, again decreasing towards the end of lactation. Our results illustrate the substantial variability, both between individuals and within individuals over time, that is likely to reflect variations in prey distribution and in the growth requirements of pups. Such variations need to be taken into account when estimating habitat use and resource utilisation in marine top predators.

These exogenous factors include those generated by modifications in fishery vessel efficiency, variations in fishing strategies, and environmental fluctuations. The selection of the latter has been considered to be one of the most difficult, arbitrary, and poorly documented stages since the environmental effects vary on different temporal scales in autocorrelated and non-random manners, influencing the CPUE through a cause-effect process. Transfer function models (TFM) were constructed to describe statistically the cause-effect relationship between two time-series and herein we propose that TFM are a valid tool for: i) discriminating environmental effects that influence the CPUE and ii) describing how these effects should be included in a generalized lineal model (GLM). We analyzed the Antarctic krill CPUE from August 1989 to July 1999, and as possible causal effects, the Antarctic Oscillation Index (AOI) and atmospheric pressure at sea level (APSL). TFM shows that the APSL, with an annual lag (APSL12), influences the CPUE of Antarctic krill, whereas the AOI did not have a significant effect. The use of APSL12 in the GLM increased the explanation of the deviance by 31% as compared with the APSL with no lag. We concluded that TFM constitute a promising tool for including environmental effects in the standardization of the CPUE that would result in less biased and more accurate indexes of abundance.																	0718-560X	0717-7178					2011	39	1					71	81		10.3856/vol39-issue1-fulltext-7							WOS:000288178700007

Free Fatty Acids in Commercial Krill Oils: Concentrations, Compositions, and Implications for Oxidative Stability	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN OIL CHEMISTS SOCIETY												The concentrations and pro-oxidative effects of free fatty acids in commercial krill oil are not well defined. We now report that krill oil free fatty acids account for 2-13% of total lipids in commercial krill oil (n = 8) that these compounds are enriched in eicosapentaenoic acid (+7.1%) and docosahexaenoic acid (+6.3%) relative to whole oils; and that this composition make them highly pro-oxidizing in marine triacylglycerol oils, but not in krill oil, which derives oxidative stability from both its phospholipids, and neutral lipids (the latter because of astaxanthin). Specific fatty acid esterification patterns showed that krill oil free fatty acids predominantly (88-93%) originated from phospholipids, mainly from the sn-2 position, which was eight-fold more hydrolyzed than the sn-1 position. Lipolysis was not ongoing in stored oils. Adding small amounts of krill oil (1-5%) to marine triacylglycerol oils significantly increased their oxidative stability and also their resistance to free fatty acid-mediated pro-oxidative effects.

There was a high positive correlation (r = 0.77) between plant pigment contents of hepatopancreas and the purity (vividness) of hepatopancreas color, and a negative correlation between the pigment contents and the luminosity (brightness) of the color. During the starvation experiment the purity decreased from 0.480 to 0.198 during the first 6 days in accordance with the decrease in plant pigment contents from 4.7 to 0.9-mu-g krill-1. An examination of hepatopancreas color by a chroma meter proved an easy and quantitative way of knowing the feeding condition of E. superba.																	0722-4060					MAY	1991	11	2					135	137									WOS:A1991FN90600007

Their density distributions(1,3,4,6) have been described in the period 1926 - 51, while recent localized studies(7-10) suggest short-term changes. To examine spatial and temporal changes over larger scales, we have combined all available scientific net sampling data from 1926 to 2003. This database shows that the productive southwest Atlantic sector contains > 50% of Southern Ocean krill stocks, but here their density has declined since the 1970s. Spatially, within their habitat, summer krill density correlates positively with chlorophyll concentrations. Temporally, within the southwest Atlantic, summer krill densities correlate positively with sea-ice extent the previous winter. Summer food and the extent of winter sea ice are thus key factors in the high krill densities observed in the southwest Atlantic Ocean. Krill need the summer phytoplankton blooms of this sector, where winters of extensive sea ice mean plentiful winter food from ice algae, promoting larval recruitment(7-11) and replenishing the stock. Salps, by contrast, occupy the extensive lower-productivity regions of the Southern Ocean and tolerate warmer water than krill(2-4,12). As krill densities decreased last century, salps appear to have increased in the southern part of their range. These changes have had profound effects within the Southern Ocean food web(10,13).																	0028-0836	1476-4687				NOV 4	2004	432	7013					100	103		10.1038/nature02996							WOS:000224854900048	15525989

Tissue fluoride accumulation and kidney lesions in freshwater-reared Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) fed with high dietary fluoride concentrations	AQUACULTURE NUTRITION												Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) and other marine zooplankton may contain high levels of fluoride. The aim of the present experiment was to determine whether dietary fluoride from Antarctic krill at levels similar to the old and the new EU allowable limits in fish feeds (150 and 350 mg kg-1) would induce kidney lesions in freshwater-reared Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar). In addition to the diets containing krill, two high-sodium fluoride (NaF) diets (1500 and 3500 mg kg-1) were used to investigate the effect on growth, feed intake, faecal excretion of minerals and accumulation of fluoride in various tissues. No major effects on growth or feed intake were observed. A higher proportion of the ingested fluoride was absorbed in salmon fed with the NaF diets compared with fish fed with krill shell diets. Fluoride accumulated in liver, kidney and especially bone. Faecal excretion of calcium and magnesium was higher for the NaF-fed fish compared with fish fed with the control and krill shell diets, whereas the levels of these minerals in plasma were unaffected. Dietary fluoride from krill shells did not induce kidney lesions. One-third of the salmon fed with the highest NaF diet showed signs of crystal formation within the distal tubules and/or collecting ducts in the kidney.

To better understand the efficacy of krill meal, a 200-day feeding trial was conducted with Russian sturgeon (Acipenser gueldenstaedtii). Four extruded diets in which KM replaced 0%, 10%, 20%, or 30% of FM in the formulation were fed to sturgeons (weight 481 g) for 200 days. Growth of Russian sturgeon fed diets containing KM was as good, or even better, than fish fed a FM control diet. No differences were observed in terms of dorsal muscle composition between the fish fed diets which contained KM and those fed the FM control diet. Fluoride concentrations in the dorsal muscle, liver, and kidney, as well as swim bladder in all dietary groups were below a detectable limit. In the gills, skin, vertebral bone and dorsal scutes, the fluoride content from the KM groups progressively increased with dietary fluoride concentration. In conclusion, KM can be a partial substitute for FM in the diets of Russian sturgeon without affecting normal growth performance.																	0792-156X						2016	68								1319								WOS:000386305900001

To simulate a semi-intensive culture system, a total of 4,500 shrimp with a body weight (BW) of 3.07 +/- 0.01 g were stocked with 25 animals/m(2) in 20 cages in a 2.16-ha pond. After 60 days of rearing, the 3% HPK diet achieved a significantly higher yield (22,094.0 +/- 130.35 g/cage) in comparison to the control diet (19,301.6 +/- 272.28 g/cage) (P < 0.05). When the feed cost per kg shrimp produced was compared, it was significantly lower in the 3% HPK group (US$1.01/kg shrimp) when compared to the control group (US$1.11/kg shrimp). The results indicate that low feeding cost diets can profit from the partial replacement of fish meal by HPK to optimize shrimp growth performance without increasing formula cost.																	1045-4438	1545-0805															10.1080/10454438.2021.1976346		SEP 2021					WOS:000698215500001

It plays a major trophic role in coastal Antarctic waters as a predator of krill and as prey for penguins and seals. A previous study, using mtDNA to investigate Pleuragramma population structure at multiple Antarctic sites was unable to discriminate between hypotheses of panmixia, with occasional fluctuations of allelic frequencies, and population structure. The aim of the present study was to investigate the population structure of P.antarctica along the Antarctic Peninsula (AP) shelf by microsatellite genotyping. LocationFour areas along the AP shelf: Charcot Island, Marguerite Bay, Joinville Island and the Larsen Ice Shelf. MethodsA total of 562 individuals from nine population samples were genotyped at 16 expressed sequence tag (EST)-linked microsatellites. Genetic variability, Hardy-Weinberg probabilities and F-statistics were calculated, and a hierarchical analysis of molecular variance was carried out. A Bayesian method was applied to estimate the migration rates between geographical localities. ResultsWe found one genetically homogeneous population with no interannual variability in the south-western AP and one off the northern tip of the AP. Significant differences were recorded between the two geographical regions, which also differed from the eastern AP. The extent of differentiation changed between years and significant genetic differentiation was found between clusters of individuals of different length modes collected at Joinville Island in 2010. Bayesian analysis suggested weak gene flow along the western AP, with a prevailing direction from north to south, following the anticlockwise-flowing Coastal Current. Main conclusionsPopulation genetic structure can be detected in AP shelf samples of P.antarctica. Thus, even in this area characterized by strong oceanographic currents, genetic mixing is not complete. Temporal fluctuations of allelic frequencies and genetic differentiation between individuals of different length collected at the same location suggest the importance of genetic drift in this highly abundant species.

The long-term seasonal semi-monthly climatology in egg abundance revealed that krill generally reproduced during two periods, i.e. in late spring (mid-May to late June) and in late summer (August to mid-September), when phytoplankton biomass in the upper 50 m was greater than 75 mg chlorophyll a m(-2). The identification of krill eggs to the species level in 2007 revealed that Meganyctiphanes norvegica egg abundance was related to the biomass of phytoplankton averaged over the month prior to sampling, corresponding to the duration of one spawning cycle (two intermolt periods) known for this species. Overall krill egg abundance varied significantly between years, showing high abundance every 3-5 years with no long-term interannual trend. The annual mean egg abundance normalized for the duration of krill spawning showed the same interannual long-term pattern. Both egg abundance indices were independent of the annual phytoplankton biomass, indicating that interannual variations in krill spawning biomass would be the most likely candidate to explain interannual variability in egg abundance. We propose that such normalized annual egg abundance based on high-resolution seasonal sampling could be a useful index of interannual variations in krill spawning biomass which is otherwise difficult to sample.

Consequently, most information on growth and age of these pelagic crustaceans has come from demographic studies on preserved specimens. Only one species of krill, Euphausia superba, has been intensively studied in the laboratory, but the experimental findings on growth and age from these studies have fundamentally altered our perceptions of the population biology of this species. Most other species of krill remain in the preexperimental phase of understanding; thus, there remain considerable uncertainties regarding their growth and longevity. Unfortunately, these uncertainties are often ignored in ecological studies. In this paper, I have examined the role that experimental studies have played in increasing knowledge of the population biology of krill, particularly in the fields of growth and aging. I have indicated where discrepancies exist between field-based and experimental approaches and I outline some approaches for exploring these discrepancies and suggest some potentially fruitful areas for future research.																	0706-652X	1205-7533					2000	57			3			168	177		10.1139/cjfas-57-S3-168							WOS:000166531600015

The selectivity of the utilized netting depends on the sizes and opening angles of the mesh. The effects of the mesh size and mesh opening angle on the fishing selectivity of Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) were assessed via micro-cosmos experiments. The results show that both the absolute abundance and the incidence of larger krill individuals passing through experimental panels are proportional to the utilized mesh size. Krill individuals larger than 35 mm passed through experimental panels at mesh opening angles larger than 50 degrees for a 15 mm mesh size, 35 degrees for a 20 mm mesh size and 20 degrees for a 30 mm mesh size. Additionally, all L50 values increased with an increasing mesh size and an increasing mesh opening angle at the same mesh size. Furthermore, the selection range increased with an increasing mesh size and with an increasing mesh opening angle at the same mesh size. This paper provides scientific guidance for the choice of liner mesh sizes of krill trawl with the aim to improve fishing efficiency while minimizing fishing losses and potential negative ecosystem impacts from fisheries.																		2077-1312				APR	2021	9	4							372	10.3390/jmse9040372							WOS:000643122500001

The EGSL is the southernmost limit of seasonal sea-ice cover in the North Atlantic and constitutes a dynamic frontier between Arctic and Atlantic water masses. In order to better understand the complex mechanisms underpinning the spatio-temporal dynamics of the production and distribution of these keystone forage species in the EGSL, we coupled in a Lagrangian framework an individual-based model (IBM) of krill physiology to a three-dimensional regional circulation model and a NPZD-type biogeochemical model. Our results show that the spatio-temporal production dynamics of both krill species was principally controlled by their food dynamics. Our numerical analyses highlighted the potential areas of krill production within the EGSL during spring and summer. We confirmed that the St. Lawrence Estuary was the most productive area, and we show that it subsidizes the central and southern Gulf during most of the growing season. The Estuary is part of a larger cyclonic circuit of krill production and transport that runs along the shores of most of the EGSL and the slope of the Laurentian Channel.

Results indicated that Fe2+ bound to the carbonyl, carboxyl, or hydroxyl groups of DELEDSLER, EEEFDATR, and DTDSEEEIR at stoichiometric ratios of 0.453, 0.466, and 0.490, respectively. DTDSEEEIR with three consecutive Glu in the middle of the sequence possessed higher iron-binding ability and iron release potential than EEEFDATR with three consecutive Glu in the N-terminal, and DELEDSLER with three discontinuous Glu showed the lowest values. Although EEEFDATR showed remarkably lower digestion stability than DTDSEEEIR, the effect of EEEFDATR-iron on iron solubility and absorption was comparable to that of DTDSEEEIR-iron, but better than that of DELEDSLER-iron and FeSO4. Thus, peptides with consecutive Glu have the potential as an effective iron carrier to improve iron absorption.																	2042-6496	2042-650X				SEP 21	2021	12	18					8615	8625		10.1039/d1fo01405f		JUL 2021					WOS:000680466100001	34346465

The average swimming angle was 30.4 degrees (s.d.=19.9 degrees), which was about 15 degrees less than that reported for Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba). Parameters for the swimming angle distribution were substituted into the straight cylinder model and the corresponding TS values were determined. The mean TS values of 16.4 mm isada krill for hovering animals were lower than the maximum TS; differences were 7.8-5.0 dB, 14.8-8.6 dB, and 18.1-10.8 dB at 50, 120, and 200 kHz, respectively. These differences will lead to a 1/6-1/3, 1/30-1/7, and 1/65-1/12 proportional difference, respectively, in estimating abundances compared to estimates based on the maximum TS. Measurements carried out al higher frequencies are more influenced by swimming angle than those at lower frequencies. However, the TS is less at lower Frequencies and it is more difficult to filter out noise. Thus, medium frequencies are suggested as the best for krill surveys. Additionally, when conducting resource surveys by echosounding, it is necessary to assign the appropriate swimming angles for different targets. Swimming angles need to be investigated further under a variety of conditions.

This study aimed to identify marine features that are important for foraging of chinstrap penguins (Pygoscelis antarcticus), an abundant upper-trophic level predator in the Antarctic Peninsula region. We investigated the foraging locations of penguins breeding on King George Island using GPS- depth loggers. Tracking data from 18 birds (4232 dives), 11 birds (2095 dives), and 19 birds (3947 dives) were obtained in 2007, 2010, and 2015, respectively. In all three years, penguins frequently visited an area near a seamount (Orca Seamount) in Bransfield Strait. The percentage of dives (27.8% in 2007, 36.1% in 2010, and 19.1% in 2015) and depth wiggles (27.1% in 2007, 37.2% in 2010, and 22.3% in 2015) performed in this area was higher than that expected from the size of the area and distance from the colony (8.4% for 2007, 14.7% for 2010, and 6.3% for 2015). Stomach content analysis showed that the penguins fed mainly on Antarctic krill. These results suggest that the seamount provided a favorable foraging area for breeding chinstrap penguins, with high availability of Antarctic krill, possibly related to local upwelling.

The effects of the hydrolysates on cholecystokinin (CCK) secretion and cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) activation were tested in murine enteroendocrine cell line STC-1. Meanwhile, the signaling mechanism by which the hydrolysates induce CCK secretion was investigated by using inhibitors of signaling proteins. Results indicated that KPHSD and KPHAP both could significantly stimulate CCK secretion and CREB activation. The stimulating effects on CCK release showed a positive correlation with the relative content of peptides with molecular weight ranging from 1,000 to 3,000 Da, indicating this component may mainly account for the ability. The inhibitors on calcium-sensing receptor, PKA, Ca2+/CaMKII, P-38-MAPK, and an intracellular calcium chelator all inhibited krill protein hydrolysates-induced CCK secretion and CREB activation, indicating the involvement of the Ca2+/CaM/CaMK, cAMP/PKA and MAPK pathways in the stimulation of CCK secretion.																	0145-8892	1745-4549				JUN	2017	41	3							e12903	10.1111/jfpp.12903							WOS:000405783400018						
J	Fallon, NG; Fielding, S; Fernandes, PG				Fallon, Niall G.; Fielding, Sophie; Fernandes, Paul G.			Classification of Southern Ocean krill and icefish echoes using random forests	ICES JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE												Target identification remains a challenge for acoustic surveys of marine fauna. Antarctic krill, Euphausia superba, are typically identified through a combination of expert scrutiny of echograms and analysis of differences in mean volume backscattering strengths (S-V; dB re 1 m(-1)) measured at two or more echosounder frequencies. For commonly used frequencies, however, the differences for krill are similar to those for many co-occurring fish species that do not possess swimbladders. At South Georgia, South Atlantic, one species in particular, mackerel icefish, Champsocephalus gunnari, forms pelagic aggregations, which can be difficult to distinguish acoustically from large krill layers. Mackerel icefish are currently surveyed using bottom-trawls, but the resultant estimates of abundance may be biased because of the species' semi-pelagic distribution. An acoustic estimate of the pelagic component of the population could indicate the magnitude of this bias, but first a reliable target identification method is required. To address this, random forests (RFs) were generated using acoustic and net sample data collected during surveys. The final RF classified as krill, icefish, and mixed aggregations of weak scattering fish species with an overall estimated accuracy of 95%. Minimum S-V, mean aggregation depth (m), mean distance from the seabed (m), and geographic positional data were most important to the accuracy of the RF. Time-of-day and the difference between S-V at 120 kHz (S-V 120) and that at 38 kHz (S-V 38) were also important. The RF classification resulted in significantly higher estimates of backscatter apportioned to krill when compared with widely applied identification methods based on fixed and variable ranges of S-V 120-S-V 38. These results suggest that krill density is underestimated when those S-V-differencing methods are used for target identification. RFs are an objective means for target identification and could enhance the utility of incidentally collected acoustic data.

J	Pakhomov, EA				Pakhomov, EA			Salp/krill interactions in the eastern Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY												Spatial distribution and feeding ecophysiology of the Antarctic krill, Euphausia superba, and the tunicate, Salpa thompsoni, were investigated along the 6degreesE meridian between 49 and 65degreesS. Krill and salps displayed pronounced spatial segregation along the transect. Salps clearly dominated north of the 56degreesS parallel, while krill dominated south of it. Overlap in krill/salp distribution occurred only at approximate to56degreesS. This region coincided with the northernmost expansion of the subsurface cold water layer and with the Winter Ice Edge (WIE) region suggesting a clear biotopical separation of these key-stone species in the Antarctic pelagic food web. Krill and salp grazing rates determined using the in situ gut fluorescence technique were low (<1% of daily primary production) to moderate (<25%) in the areas south and north of the WIE region. However, in the region of their overlap, krill and salps alone consumed up to 86% of daily primary production. Assuming that all faecal pellets produced sink, krill and salp would be able to re-package and remove from surface layers <2%, up to 37% and 3-12% of primary production per day in the regions south, within and north of the WIE, respectively. In real terms, krill/salp mediated in situ carbon flux range from 0.01 to 3.7 and from 9.6 to 23.8 mg C m(-2)d(-1) south and north of the WIE region, respectively, and would be as high as 48 mg C m(-2)d(-1) in the WIE region.

J	STUART, V				STUART, V			FECUNDITY OF EUPHAUSIA-LUCENS (HANSEN) - LABORATORY EVIDENCE FOR MULTIPLE BROODS	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY												There has been much controversy in the past as to how many broods euphausiids are capable of producing per season. Several authors have suggested that multiple broods are possible, although this has not been demonstrated in the laboratory. In the present study, two Euphausia lucens females were shown to spawn continuously over a period of at least 2.5 months. The euphausiids produced almost-equal-to 33-40 broods during this period, representing 134-192% of their body carbon. Daily egg production rates varied from 0 to 86 eggs, representing a mean of 3-4% of their body carbon d-1. Egg production rates were often severely depressed during moulting, and were also somewhat lower during experimental manipulation (changing food conditions). The results suggest that egg production by E. lucens, and perhaps by many other euphausiid species, are considerably higher than was previously thought.																	0022-0981						1992	160	2					221	228		10.1016/0022-0981(92)90239-7							WOS:A1992JV26800005

The extract was fractionated in three fractions with different molecular weight (MW) ranges (>20.000 relative molecular mass (rel. mol. mass), 2000-20,000 rel. mol. mass and <2000 rel. mol. mass), which were further analyzed by SEC with columns having different optimum fractionation ranges in order to obtain more detailed information about the MW distribution of the elements. Various distribution profiles for the target elements among different MW ranges were observed. The results obtained indicated that manganese. zinc, silver, cadmium and lead species were mostly distributed in the higher MW range (>20.000 rel. mol. mass). In the case of chromium, iron, cobalt, arsenic and selenium, most of them bind to species with lower MW (<2000 rel. mol. mass). Only copper and nickel species was predominantly present in middle MW range (2000-20,000 rel. mol. mass). Further speciation of arsenic compounds in the small MW fraction was carried out with anion exchange chromatography (AEC) coupled with ICP-MS. The results showed that the dominant arsenic species in this fraction is As(III) (63% of extractable arsenic), while As(V) (13%) and two unknown arsenic species (19%, and 5%, respectively) are present in lower amounts.

Krill oil supplementation increases plasma concentrations of eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic acids in overweight and obese men and women	NUTRITION RESEARCH												Antarctic krill, also known as Euphausia superba, is a marine crustacean rich in both eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). We tested the hypothesis that krill Oil Would increase plasma concentrations of EPA and DHA without adversely affecting indicators of safety, tolerability, or selected metabolic parameters. In this randomized, double-blind parallel arm trial, overweight and obese men and women (N = 76) were randomly assigned to receive double-blind Capsules containing 2 g/d of krill oil, menhaden oil, or control (olive) oil for 4 weeks. Results showed that plasma EPA and DHA concentrations increased significantly more (P < .001) in the krill oil (178.4 +/- 38.7 and 90.2 +/- 40.3 mu mol/L, respectively) and menhaden oil (131.8 +/- 28.0 and 149.9 +/- 30.4 mu mol/L, respectively) groups than in the control group (2.9 +/- 13.8 and -1.1 +/- 32.4 mu mol/L, respectively). Systolic blood pressure declined significantly more (P < .05) in the menhaden oil (-2.2 +/- 2.0 min Hg) group than in the control group (3.3 +/- 1.5 mm Hg), and the response in the krill oil group (-0.8 +/- 1.4 mm Hg) did not differ from the other 2 treatments. Blood urea nitrogen declined in the krill oil group as compared with the menhaden oil group (P < .006). No significant differences for other safety variables were noted, including adverse events. In conclusion, 4 weeks of krill oil supplementation increased plasma EPA and DHA and was well tolerated, with no indication of adverse effects on safety parameters. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

J	Constable, AJ; Nicol, S				Constable, AJ; Nicol, S			Defining smaller-scale management units to further develop the ecosystem approach in managing large-scale pelagic krill fisheries in Antarctica	CCAMLR SCIENCE												This paper discusses the principles and approach required for developing small-scale management units to take account of predators' needs when managing the fishery for Antarctic krill. It provides a theoretical foundation for considering the scales of management units involving the integration of local populations of harvested species, foraging areas of predators, fishing grounds and the potential influences of the environment, including oceanography and metapopulation structure of the harvested species. The integration of these components involves two different types of unit: the 'harvesting unit', which is at the scale of the metapopulation of the harvested species, and the 'predator unit', which does not have to be a relatively self-contained ecosystem but should be sufficiently independent for fishing in that unit not to inadvertently affect predators being monitored in other units. The South Atlantic region (Area 48) is used to illustrate how to define predator units. The derived conceptual model is then used to formulate an approach for developing fisheries on prey species, notably krill, in other harvesting units. The manner in which predator units can be used to help the CCAMLR Ecosystem Monitoring Program (CEMP) provide strategic advice on the effects of fishing is discussed. In general, the early acquisition of information on the distribution of local populations of krill and the potential foraging densities of predators from within a harvesting unit (i.e. abundance of predators, distribution of colonies and foraging range) will provide a means of circumscribing predator units as well as undertaking an assessment of long-term annual yield. It is proposed that the early development of the fishery could be concentrated in a small number of units in such a way that the relative fishing intensities in those units are equivalent, although not necessarily equal, to the intensity expected across all units once the catch limit had been reached. Other units in which fishing was not occurring could be monitored as well. This process could help determine whether or not the catch limit is likely to cause undesirable effects on predators in any of the predator units. In this way, it is possible to determine, well in advance of the catch limit being reached, whether or not local restrictions on harvesting are necessary, as well as the overall requirements for the monitoring program.																	1023-4063						2002	9						117	131									WOS:000179438500009

Euphausiids (krill) are important members of the local zooplankton grazer community and comprise the primary diet of squid, baleen whales, and many seabirds. Krill are thus a key potential vector for the transfer of DA to higher trophic level organisms in Monterey Bay. A better understanding of the quantitative trophic interactions and body burden of DA in krill is required to predict whether they tan act as an effective vector for this neurotoxin. Here we report results of toxin analyses and gut content examinations of krill Euphausia pacifica collected from Monterey Bay in 2000. Corresponding counts of toxic Pseudo-nitzschia species in the water and their cellular DA concentrations were also obtained at the collection sites. Toxin analysis by receptor binding assay demonstrated that DA in krill tissue varied between 0.1 to 44 mug DA equiv. g(-1) tissue (confirmed by tandem mass spectrometry), with levels corresponding to the abundance of toxic Pseudo-nitzschia species present in the water. The occurrence of Pseudo-nitzschia australis frustules in the digestive tract of E. pacifica verified that a toxic species of this diatom was an important part of their diet and thus implicated this phytoplankter as the source of DA. These findings provide compelling evidence for the role of krill as a potential transfer agent of the phycotoxin DA to higher trophic levels in marine food web.

Top predators in relation to bathymetry, ice and krill during austral winter in Marguerite Bay, Antarctica	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY												A key hypothesis guiding the US Southern Ocean Global Ocean Ecosystems Dynamics (US SO GLOBEC) program is that deep across-shelf troughs facilitate the transport of warm and nutrient-rich waters onto the continental shelf of the Western Antarctic Peninsula, resulting in enhanced winter production and prey availability to top predators. We tested aspects of this hypothesis during austral winter by assessing the distribution of the resident pack-ice top predators in relation to these deep across-shelf troughs and by investigating associations between top predators and their prey. Surveys were conducted July-August 2001 and August-September 2002 in Marguerite Bay, Antarctica, with a focus on the main across-shelf trough in the bay, Marguerite Trough. The common pack-ice seabird species were snow petrel (Pagodroma nivea, 1.2 individuals km(-2)), Antarctic petrel (Thalassoica antarctica, 0.3 individuals km(-2)), and Adelie penguin (Pygoscelis adeliae, 0.5 individuals km(-2)). The most common pack-ice pinniped was crabeater seal (Lobodon carcinophagus). During both winters, snow and Antarctic petrels were associated with low sea-ice concentrations independent of Marguerite Trough, while Adelie penguins Occurred in association with this trough. Krill concentrations, both shallow and deep, also were associated with Adelie penguin and snow petrel distributions. During both winters, crabeater seal occurrence was associated with deep krill concentrations and with regions of lower chlorophyll concentration. The area of lower chlorophyll concentrations Occurred in an area with complex bathymetry close to land and heavy ice concentrations. Complex or unusual bathymetry via its influence on physical and biological processes appears to be one of the keys to understanding how top predators survive during the winter in this Antarctic region.

M.; Borchers, David; Boveng, Peter; De la Mare, William			Taking account of dependent species in management of the Southern Ocean krill fishery: estimating crabeater seal abundance off east Antarctica	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY												1. The crabeater seal Lobodon carcinophaga is considered to be a key species in the krill-based food-web of the Southern Ocean. Reliable estimates of the abundance of this species are necessary to allow the development of multispecies, predator-prey models as a basis for management of the krill fishery in the Southern Ocean. 2. A survey of crabeater seal abundance was undertaken in 1500 000 km(2) of pack-ice off east Antarctica between longitudes 64-150 degrees E during the austral summer of 1999/2000. Sighting surveys, using double observer line transect methods, were conducted from an icebreaker and two helicopters to estimate the density of seals hauled out on the ice in survey strips. Satellite-linked dive recorders were deployed on a sample of seals to estimate the probability of seals being hauled out on the ice at the times of day when sighting surveys were conducted. Model-based inference, involving fitting a density surface, was used to infer densities in the entire survey region from estimates in the surveyed areas. 3. Crabeater seal abundance was estimated to be between 0.7 and 1.4 million animals (with 95% confidence), with the most likely estimate slightly less than 1 million. 4. Synthesis and applications. The estimation of crabeater seal abundance in Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR) management areas off east Antarctic where krill biomass has also been estimated recently provides the data necessary to begin extending from single-species to multispecies management of the krill fishery. Incorporation of all major sources of uncertainty allows a precautionary interpretation of crabeater abundance and demand for krill in keeping with CCAMLR's precautionary approach to management. While this study focuses on the crabeater seal and management of living resources in the Southern Ocean, it has also led to technical and theoretical developments in survey methodology that have widespread potential application in ecological and resource management studies, and will contribute to a more fundamental understanding of the structure and function of the Southern Ocean ecosystem.

The first section provides the background to CCAMLR, including the formulation of the convention and its objectives, its operation, and the historical trends in fisheries. Later sections describe (i) the reasons why a precautionary approach to setting catch limits evolved, (ii) how the precautionary approach takes account of ecosystem objectives and provides for the orderly development of new fisheries, and (iii) how the use of ecosystem indicators in the setting of catch limits and for monitoring the effects of fishing is being evaluated. The final section describes the general framework being used to develop a feedback-management system that incorporates objectives, target species assessments and ecosystem assessments. The CCAMLR experience provides two important lessons. First, conservation objectives can only be achieved by implementing management measures, even when very little is known. Second, methods were found for achieving scientific consensus despite the uncertainties surrounding estimates of parameters and the behaviour of the system. CCAMLR is yet to face the real test in its ecosystem approach, the development of the krill fishery. Before this occurs, appropriate management procedures have to be developed to avoid localized effects on the ecosystem and to provide effective feedbacks on the effects of fishing through its monitoring programme.

Aspects of the foraging behaviour of the Antarctic Tern Sterna vittata gaini at Harmony Point, South Shetland Islands	POLAR BIOLOGY												During January and February of 2002 and 2003, we studied the diet of the Antarctic Tern Sterna vittata gaini at two colonies in Nelson Island, South Shetland Islands, by identifying the prey fed to chicks by breeders. The fish Notothenia coriiceps was the main prey in both seasons, followed by the myctophid Electrona antarctica, Antarctic krill Euphausia superba and gammarid amphipods. The contribution of fish to the diet increased as chicks grew older. Fish and amphipods were brought to chicks during the day, whereas adults brought Antarctic krill at sunrise and sunset. Both the duration of the feeding trips and the number of trips per foraging bout varied according to the type of prey caught. Preliminary information suggests that, among other causes, the foraging strategy is strongly influenced by the predation pressure of skuas on chicks. Results are compared with the only two previous study on the diet of the Antarctic Tern at the South Shetland Islands.																	0722-4060	1432-2056				FEB	2008	31	3					327	331		10.1007/s00300-007-0362-3							WOS:000252193100009

The distance between the estimated and observed distributions was measured with the Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic. Sample variability was determined using resampling techniques. The ability of linear functions (Models I and II), allometric and non-parametric methods to recover the observed distributions was evaluated within samples and exchanging parameters between samples. Linear and allometric models proved inadequate to recover the distribution, while the differences obtained with non-parametric methods fall within the bounds of sample variability, suggesting that a linear equation does not capture the relation between total and exopodit length. The use of a non-parametric regression is recommended to increase the sample size when estimating the distributions of prey lengths in the stomach contents of Antarctic penguins.																	0722-4060	1432-2056				MAY	2008	31	6					717	724		10.1007/s00300-008-0411-6							WOS:000255059200007

The results demonstrated that molecular weight (MW) of commercial chitosan (CCS), WSCS, GPCS, and AKCS were 1175.8, 2130.4, 1293.3, and 1109.3 kDa with the degree of deacetylation (DDA) of 73.5, 74.1, 82.1, and 75.9%, respectively. Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and scanning electron microscope (SEM) were employed to study the structural differences of CS. Moreover, storage modulus (G ') and loss modulus (G '') of AKCS were lower than that of WSCS and GPCS, respectively, but higher than that of CCS. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bacterial concentration (MBC) of CS againstEscherichia coliandStaphylococcus aureuswere investigated at concentration between 0.0125 and 1 mg/mL.

Among these changes are the development of cryptophytes under warmer conditions in detriment of diatoms, and the reduced krill availability in the environment. An isotopic approach was used to investigate whether the temporal and spatial patterns of energy transfer from phytoplankton (using particulate organic matter - POM - as a proxy of primary producers) to baleen whales (humpback Megaptera novaeanglieae, fin - Balaenoptera physalus, Antarctic minke - Balaenoptera bonaerensis), and killer whales - Orcinus orca - is similar in areas under different effects of warming around the northern Antarctic Peninsula (NAP). Samples of POM (n = 65), krill (n = 29) and skin of baleen (n = 106) and, opportunistically, killer whales (n = 5) were collected in Gerlache and Bransfield Straits (western AP) and the Powell Basin (northeastern AP) during the austral summers of 2013-2016. Mean isotope values for delta C-13 and delta N-15 values were, respectively, -26.3 parts per thousand (+/- 2.9) and 0.9 parts per thousand (+/- 1.7) for POM, -25.6 parts per thousand (0.9) and 5.3 parts per thousand (+/- 1.1) for krill, -24.1 parts per thousand (+/- 2) and 8.9 parts per thousand (+/- 1.5) for humpback, -24.6 parts per thousand (+/- 1.2) and 8.2 parts per thousand (+/- 0.7) for fin, -24.4 parts per thousand (+/- 1.6) and 8.7 parts per thousand (+/- 1) for Antarctic minke whales, and 23.6 parts per thousand (+/- 1.2) and 8.9%0 (+/- 1.7) for killer whales. Interannual significant differences were found for delta C-13 values of POM and fin whales' samples, while spatial differences were found for delta C-13 values of POM samples and humpback whales and for delta N-15 values of POM, humpback and Antarctic minke whales. Lower delta C-13 and delta N-15 values for the base of the food web tended to be observed towards open sea regions (Powell Basin and an area under the influence of the Bellingshausen Sea waters). The isoscapes generated for the baseline of the NAP ecosystem provided unprecedented information, to the best of our knowledge, of how the delta C-13 and delta N-15 values of POM varied spatially and temporally in the region. HPLC-CHEMTAX pigment analysis indicated that two of the main phytoplankton groups in the study region were diatoms and cryptophytes. The contribution of these groups to the total phytoplankton biomass was positively and negatively correlated with the POM delta C-13 values, respectively. Despite the spatial and temporal limited interpretation of our results due to our reduced sampling effort to the east of the AP and to the relatively short temporal range investigated, the differences observed in the isotopic composition are considered representative of contrasting environmental conditions. The present study provides new insights on stable isotope values in the Antarctic ecosystem and may help to foresee the consequences of physico-chemical changes in water properties to the biota due to global warming.

Krill fed on phytoplankton during the day (as deduced from gut fluorescence measurements), whereas they switched to carnivory during the night (as deduced from gut contents). The vertical migration and the feeding behaviour of krill agree with different observations in the literature and gives an additional explanation to the observed inverse relationship between krill and non-krill zoo-plankton. The fact that krill is able to prey on mesozooplankton suggests that euphausiids can exert a top-down effect which structures the plankton community of Antarctic waters.

J	Ross, RM; Quetin, LB; Newberger, T; Oakes, SA				Ross, RM; Quetin, LB; Newberger, T; Oakes, SA			Growth and behavior of larval krill (Euphausia superba) under the ice in late winter 2001 west of the Antarctic Peninsula	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY												In situ growth rates are one measure of the physiological condition of larval Antarctic krill in winter. During the southern ocean global ecosystem dynamics (SO GLOBEC) research cruise in July/August 2001 aboard the ARSV Laurence M. Gould west of Adelaide Island and Marguerite Bay, larval krill were observed in the under-ice habitat. Ten instantaneous growth rate experiments were conducted with larvae collected from the under-ice habitat on the outer shelf, mid-shelf, and just south of Adelaide Island in the mouth of Marguerite Bay. For all experiments, average growth increments for larval krill were about -1.6% per intermolt period, with a median intermolt period of 30.6d. Larvae were observed feeding on the ice, even though no color was visible in the ice. Pigment (chlorophyll a equivalents) content of larvae from three of the sites was measured as an indicator of ingestion of sea-ice microalgae. Pigment values were above those found in starved controls, but only about 20% of maximum possible values. Although feeding, the data suggested that the larval krill were unable to ingest enough food to maintain growth. The results from this first SO GLOBEC winter process cruise were compared to growth rates of larval krill during previous winter cruises that covered all months from late May through September, except for the month of August.

This paper describes an effort to quantify these variabilities at fine temporal and spatial scales during a three-day experiment at a fixed location, using high-resolution, stratified Bioness samples and echo-integration, and assuming a fixed distribution of krill orientations. Night-time catches in the krill scattering layer (SL) were 15 times the acoustic estimates. The situation was reversed during daytime, when the acoustic estimates in the SL were 5 times larger than the catches. This collectively resulted in a +/- 10-dB gradual diel cycle in the difference of vertically integrated biomass from both sampling methods. Use of a strobe light on the Bioness reduced avoidance of the net by krill and significantly increased (x10) daytime catches in the SL, but had no significant effect on night-time catches. The difference in volume-backscattering strength at 120 and 38 kHz (Delta S(v120-38)) in the densest parts of the SL agreed with predictions using a target-strength (TS) model and an assumed normal distribution of tilt (mean theta = 11 degrees; s.d. = 4 degrees). The Delta S(v120-38) was smaller for lower densities and during night-time. It appears that the theta and, therefore, TS distributions of krill significantly change during their diel vertical migrations. At twilight and at night, when they are feeding and swimming vertically, they exhibit lower mean TS and Delta S(v120-38) and react less to strong strobe-light pulses, in contrast to daytime. Diel patterns in TS and net avoidance should be taken into account in krill-biomass assessments that use round the clock acoustic-survey data and multi-frequency TS models for target classification.

J	MARQUARDT, FH; CARRENO, RR				MARQUARDT, FH; CARRENO, RR			THE PRODUCTION OF COLORLESS CHITIN FROM ANTARCTIC KRILL (EUPHAUSIA-SUPERBA) SHELL WASTE	ARCHIV FUR FISCHEREIWISSENSCHAFT												Up to now, the pigments from the eyes of krill, caused an intense, in acetone non-extractable, pink coloration. In the course of a demineralisation (prior to a deproteinisation), the eyes lose their solid structure and change into a sticky mass, which retains their pigmentation. This mass attaches itself to the walls and baffles of the reactor, and in this way can be separated with ease from the suspension of solid shell residues. Treatment of these residues with acetone, followed by deproteinisation, yields colourless chitin. This technique for the removal of the pigmented eye-mass could be used to develop a process for the production of colourless chitin in industrial scales. The chitin-colouring eye pigments of krill were found to be of two types, which differ in their solubility in acetone. Aside from the well-known red acetone-soluble astaxanthines, a brown, acetone-insoluble pigmentation, was also observed, which was assumed to be the krill ommochrome and/or xanthomatin. If the chitin is coloured by a mixture of both types of pigments, the astaxanthines apparently lose their solubility in acetone.																	0003-9063					JUN	1992	41	2					159	163									WOS:A1992HX59400003

In the present study, these factors were evaluated in the pelagic Southern Ocean taxa Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) and myctophid fish (Electrona antarctica, Gymnoscopelus braueri and G. nicholsi) to establish a baseline record for future studies. Mercury (Hg) concentrations were also analysed to evaluate its potential impacts on species biochemical performance. E. superba had higher metabolic activity than most of the myctophid species, which may explain the comparatively lower energy reserves found in the former. The activity of antioxidant enzymes showed, generally, a lower level in E. superba than in the myctophid species. The lack of any relationship between Hg concentrations and organisms? antioxidant and biotransformation defence mechanisms indicate that levels of Hg accumulated in the studied species were not high enough to affect their biochemical processes adversely.

The difference in signal strength (Delta S-v was used to distinguish northern krill (Meganyctiphanes norvegica) from other acoustic scatterers. The approach is concluded to be very effective, but it can be improved greatly by applying the following series of simple extensions to current protocols: first, set a very low threshold on both frequencies to minimize sampling bias; second, undertake tests to confirm that the data extracted from each acoustic frequency apply to the same scatterers, third, ensure that the range of Delta S-v is not greater than the TSrange at either frequency; and finally, when abundance estimation is the primary aim, arrange for sampling at the time of day and using the acoustic frequency that together provide the least variance.																	1054-3139					JAN	2007	64	1					39	48		10.1093/icesjms/fsl010							WOS:000246865300005

Three extruded diets were fed for 100 days to salmon with an average weight of 550 g. distributed into 9 tanks equipped with flow through sea water. The dietary treatments comprised a control diet based on high-quality fish meal (FM) and two experimental diets where the FM was substituted with either partially deshelled krill meal (PDKM) or whole krill meal (WKM). Shell removal reduced the chitin content from 28 to 8 g kg(-1) dry matter (DM), while fluoride was only reduced from 940 to 631 mg kg(-1) DM. Growth rate for fish fed WKM was significantly lower than for salmon fed control diet whereas the PDKM diet did not appear to alter growth during the first feeding period. Digestibility of lipid tended to be higher for PDKM and lower for WKM compared to the FM control. No significant difference was seen for digestibility of nitrogen, but fish fed the FM diet had higher digestibility of threonine, serine, glutamine, histidine and lysine compared to fish fed the WKM diet. No major differences in plasma were seen for triacylglycerols, free fatty acids, glucose, total protein, albumin, globulin, urea, and total bilirubin. Trypsin activities in the pyloric and mid intestine were lower in fish fed the WKM diet compared to FM. Bile acid concentration in the pyloric intestine were significantly lower in fish fed the WKM diet compared to FM and PDKM. Fish fed both diets containing krill meal had signs of mild to moderate nephrosis. To conclude, PDKM could successfully replace FM as a sole protein source for Atlantic salmon, whereas the WKM slightly reduced growth rate compared to the FM and the PDKM diet. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Due to sorption of the compounds to sinking particles and accumulation in sediments, two benthic fish species (Gobionotothen gibberifrons, Chaenocephalus aceratus) feeding on benthos invertebrates and fish reflected significantly increasing concentrations within a decade (1987-1996), while a benthopelagic species (Champsocephalus gunnari) feeding on krill did not. In the pelagic food chain, lipid normalised concentrations of all compounds increased from Antarctic krill to fish proving that biomagnification of highly lipophilic pollutants (log octanol-water partition coefficient > 5) occurs in water-breathing animals. As top predators Weddell and southern elephant seals (Leptonychotes weddellii, Mirounga leonina) biomagnified the persistent organic pollutants relative to krill 30-160 fold with the exception of hexachlorobenzene, the levels of which were lower than in fish indicating its intense specific elimination.

Estimated densities of krill at SG were most often lower than at EI, although this may simply have been a function of differences in the survey and data-analysis techniques used at each site. More interestingly, the magnitudes of density and between-year gradients of density at each site were mirrored by those at the other location; for example 1991 and 1994 were years of very low krill density at both SG and EI. There was no apparent lag in changes in density between sites, and ranked between-year gradients in density at both locations were closely correlated. These pronounced similarities suggest that densities of krill at both locations are linked directly, and may be impacted by the same gross physical and biological factors (e.g. recruitment, dispersal and environmental variability) acting over the same temporal and spatial scales. The observed concordance also implies that the pelagic ecosystems at these widely separated sites (similar or equal to 1500 km distant at opposite sides of the Scotia Sea) are not operating in isolation. Fluctuations in krill density were investigated with reference to cyclical variations in sea ice extent, and in air and sea-surface temperature. The resulting model suggests that the 1999/2000 austral summer will be one of low krill density.

Euphauserase is a cold-active and thermally sensitive enzyme with a high affinity for Lys, Arg and large hydrophobic amino acids. Residue Phe137 in euphauserase, localized in loop D (autolysis loop), is highly exposed on the surface of the molecule. Therefore, it appeared to be an easy target for autolysis. The broadly specific euphauserase has a low affinity for negatively charged residues. In order to increase the stability of the enzyme, two mutants were created in which residue Phe137 was replaced by a Glu and an Asp residue. Both mutations resulted in increased stability of the recombinant euphauserase towards thermal inactivation.																	0014-2956					JAN	2001	268	1					127	131		10.1046/j.1432-1327.2001.01857.x							WOS:000166525200018	11121112

This study identified 75 microbial isolates from E. superba, that is 42 fungi and 33 bacteria including eight actinobacteria. And all the isolates showed NaF tolerance in conformity with the nature of the fluoride krill. The maximum concentration was 10%, 3% and 0.5% NaF for actinobacteria, bacteria and fungi, respectively. The results demonstrated that 82.4% bacteria, 81.3% actinobacteria and 12.3% fungi produced antibacterial metabolites against pathogenic bacteria without NaF; the MIC value reached to 3.9 mu g/mL. In addition, more than 60% fungi produced cytotoxic metabolites against A549, MCF-7 or K562 cell lines. The presence of NaF led to a reduction in the producing antimicrobial compounds, but stimulated the production of cytotoxic compounds. Furthermore, seven cytotoxic compounds were identified from the metabolites of Penicillium citrinum OUCMDZ4136 under 0.5% NaF, with the IC50 values of 3.6-13.1 mu M for MCF-7, 2.2-19.8 mu M for A549 and 5.4-15.4 mu M for K562, respectively. These results indicated that the krill microbes exert their chemical defense by producing cytotoxic compounds to the mammalians and antibacterial compounds to inhibiting the pathogenic bacteria.																	2045-2322					NOV 4	2016	6								36496	10.1038/srep36496							WOS:000387023600001	27812046					
J	Bargu, S; Lefebvre, K; Silver, MW				Bargu, Sibel; Lefebvre, Kathi; Silver, Mary W.			Effect of dissolved domoic acid on the grazing rate of krill Euphausia pacifica	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												Some amino acids released from phytoplankton into the water are known to be feeding stimulants to zooplankton. However, domoic acid (DA), a neuroexcitatory amino acid released by 14 some species of the diatom genus Pseudo-nitzschia, has the potential to be a feeding deterrent due to its neurotoxicity. Euphausiids (krill) are important members of the zooplankton grazer community and key prey items for many high level carnivores in the world's oceans. Although it is known that krill do consume toxic Pseudo-nitzschia spp. during blooms, there is currently no information concerning the effect of dissolved DA on the rate of feeding or the grazing behavior of krill. Therefore, we conducted experiments in which Euphausia pacifica were fed non-toxic P. pungens along with different added levels of either dissolved DA or glutamic acid (GA), an amino acid with a similar structure to DA. Krill grazing rates did not change significantly with added GA, but decreased significantly in the presence of DA. The rapid response of krill to dissolved DA suggests that either direct toxic action on the filtering apparatus or a chemoreceptor-like mechanism may suppress grazing in the krill. We suggest that these dissolved DA concentrations are relevant, given the DA concentrations found in Pseudo-nitzschia spp. populations in Monterey Bay and the feeding biology of krill. In either case, the suppression of feeding by dissolved DA suggests that high dissolved DA concentrations, should they occur in the field, may be a mechanism whereby blooms are perpetuated due to reduced losses to grazers such as krill.																	0171-8630						2006	312						169	175		10.3354/meps312169							WOS:000237918300014						
J	Kock, KH				Kock, Karl-Hermann			Antarctic Marine Living Resources exploitation and its management in the Southern Ocean	ANTARCTIC SCIENCE					9th Scar International Biology Symposium	JUL 25-29, 2005	Curitiba, BRAZIL					Man's activities have impacted on the Southern Ocean ecosystem for more than 200 years. The exploitation of Southern Ocean resources has followed the same pattern as in other parts of the World Ocean with exploitation starting at the highest trophic levels when seals and whales were taken in the 19th and 20th centuries. After serious over-exploitation of these groups attention moved down the food web to begin exploitation of fish and krill from the late 1960s onwards. The establishment of international management regimes for whales (International Whaling Convention) in 1948 and the remaining marine resources (Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources) in 1982 were based on different perceptions of management, the former only considering management by species whilst the latter adopted management at an ecosystem level. These fundamentally different approaches, together with major political interference, have resulted in very different outcomes for management. The Scientific Committee of the IWC developed a sustainable management system, the Revised Management Procedure, in the first half of the 1990s which, however, is still awaiting inclusion into an overall management regime, the Revised Management Scheme, and its acceptance by the Commission. The IWC is now paralysed by political agendas that have nothing to do with scientific management. In contrast, after an early period of slow progress, CCAMLR has improved its performance substantially from the beginning of the 1990s onwards and is now hailed worldwide for its ecosystem approach to sustainable management.																	0954-1020					JUN	2007	19	2					231	238		10.1017/S0954102007000302							WOS:000247196900011

The shift was observed in consecutive years (1991-1996) during the austral summer and was correlated in time and space with glacial melt-water runoff and reduced surface water salinities. Elevated temperatures along the Peninsula will increase the extent of coastal melt-water zones and the seasonal prevalence of cryptophytes. This is significant because a change from diatoms to cryptophytes represents a marked shift in the size distribution of the phytoplankton community, which will, in turn, impact the zooplankton assemblage. Cryptophytes, because of their small size, are not grazed efficiently by Antarctic krill, a keystone species in the food web. An increase in the abundance and relative proportion of cryptophytes in coastal waters along the Peninsula will likely cause a shift in the spatial distribution of krill and may allow also for the rapid asexual proliferation of carbon poor gelatinous zooplankton, salps in particular. This scenario may account for the reported increase in the frequency of occurrence and abundance of large swarms of salps within the region. Salps are not a preferred food source for organisms that occupy higher trophic levels in the food web, specifically penguins and seals, and thus negative feedbacks to the ecology of these consumers can be anticipated as a consequence of shifts in phytoplankton community composition.

J	Alonzo, SH; Switzer, PV; Mangel, M				Alonzo, SH; Switzer, PV; Mangel, M			An ecosystem-based approach to management: using individual behaviour to predict the indirect effects of Antarctic krill fisheries on penguin foraging	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY												1. Changes in species' abundance and distributions caused by human disturbances can have indirect effects on other species in a community. Although ecosystem approaches to management are becoming increasingly prevalent, they require a fuller understanding of how individual behaviour determines interactions within and between species. 2. Ecological interactions involving krill are of major importance to many species within the Antarctic. Despite extensive knowledge of the ecosystem that they occupy, there is still incomplete understanding of the links between species and the effect of environmental conditions on these interactions. In this study, we extended a behavioural model used previously to understand the interactions between penguins and krill to determine the indirect effect of krill fisheries on penguin foraging success and behaviour in adjacent breeding sites. 3. Increased fishing pressure offshore is predicted to reduce penguin food intake. Given the documented links between krill and penguins, this also leads to a prediction of decreased penguin survival and reproduction. Krill behaviour is predicted to cause stronger effects of krill fisheries than explained solely by the percentage of biomass removed. Environmental conditions that decrease krill growth rates or cause krill to spend time in deeper water are also predicted to increase the magnitude of the effect of fishing on penguin success. We show that changes in penguin foraging behaviour can be used to assess the impact of local fisheries on penguin reproductive success. 4. Synthesis and applications. These results demonstrate that an understanding of predator-prey interactions, indirect effects between species, and individual behaviour is imperative to our ability to manage populations. We describe a general method to use what is known about ecological and evolutionary processes with species-specific information to predict the response of organisms to novel situations. We further show how individual behaviour can be used to assess the impact of human disturbance on ecosystems.																	0021-8901					AUG	2003	40	4					692	702		10.1046/j.1365-2664.2003.00830.x							WOS:000184109200009

Nutrient supply is governed by a range of physical, chemical and biological processes, and there are significant feedbacks within the ecosystem. It has been suggested that baleen whales form a crucial part of biogeochemical cycling processes through the consumption of nutrient-rich krill and subsequent defecation, but data on their contribution are scarce. We analysed the concentration of iron, cadmium, manganese, cobalt, copper, zinc, phosphorus and carbon in baleen whale faeces and muscle, and krill tissue using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Metal concentrations in krill tissue were between 20 thousand and 4.8 million times higher than typical Southern Ocean HNLC seawater concentrations, while whale faecal matter was between 276 thousand and 10 million times higher. These findings suggest that krill act as a mechanism for concentrating and retaining elements in the surface layer, which are subsequently released back into the ocean, once eaten by whales, through defecation. Trace metal to carbon ratios were also higher in whale faeces compared to whale muscle indicating that whales are concentrating carbon and actively defecating trace elements. Consequently, recovery of the great whales may facilitate the recycling of nutrients via defecation, which may affect productivity in HNLC areas.

J	Reid, K; Arnould, JPY				Reid, K; Arnould, JPY			The diet of Antarctic fur seals Arctocephalus gazella during the breeding season at South Georgia	POLAR BIOLOGY												The diet of lactating female Antarctic fur seals Arctocephalus gazella at South Georgia was investigated during the pub-rearing period (January/March) of 1991-1994. Antarctic krill Euphausia superba was the main prey item, occurring in 88% of all seats (n = 497), whereas fish occurred in 47% and squid in 5% of all seats. There was considerable intra- and inter-annual variation in the characteristics of krill taken by fur seals. The distribution of krill sizes taken suggests that fur seals are not actively selecting particular sizes of krill and, therefore, that the krill in the diet reflects the krill available around South Georgia. The absence of group 3 krill (44-48 mm in length) in the South Georgia area, as indicated by their absence in the diet of seals, is suggested as a possible reason for low availability of krill and the subsequent reproductive failure among krill predators. The frequency of occurrence of fish was much higher than in previous studies; the pattern of fish consumption showed a consistent seasonal pattern in 3 of the 4 years studied. Of the total number of the myctophid Protomyctophum choriodon, the most numerous fish taxon, 98% were taken between early February and the middle of March. Champsocephalus gunnari and Lepidonotothen larseni agg., which both feed on krill, dominated the fish component of the diet outside this period and together constituted 94% of the total estimated biomass of fish consumed. The intra- and inter-annual variability in the diet of Antarctic fur seals emphasise the need for diet studies to be conducted during the entire pup-rearing periods of several years.																	0722-4060					FEB	1996	16	2					105	114		10.1007/BF02390431							WOS:A1996TR75400005

Temporal shift in the isotopic niche of female Antarctic fur seals from Bouvetoya	POLAR RESEARCH												The Antarctic fur seal (Arctocephalus gazella) is a key marine predator in the Southern Ocean, a region that has recently started to show changes as a result of global climate change. Here, carbon (delta C-13) and nitrogen (delta N-15) stable isotope analyses on whole blood and plasma samples were used to examine the isotopic niche of lactating female Antarctic fur seals. Using recently developed Bayesian approaches to determine changes in isotopic niche, a significant increase in delta C-13 and delta N-15 was found between 1997 and 2015; this change occurred at an average rate of 0.067%0 (delta C-13) and 0.072%0 (delta N-15) per year over this period. This suggests that a marked isotopic niche shift has occurred over this period, which very likely corresponds to a shift in diet towards prey at a higher trophic level, such as fish (replacing krill). Although our sampling design prevented us from exploring a seasonal trend in a conclusive manner, our data suggest that concurrent increases in delta C-13 and delta N-15 might occur as the breeding season progresses. At a seasonal scale, an average decrease of 0.7 parts per thousand per month (95% confidence interval = [0.9; 0.6]) in delta C-13 might have occurred, concurrently with an average increase of 1.1% per month in delta N-15. The results of this study constitute the first isotopic assessment for female Antarctic fur seals from Bouvetoya and provide a baseline for the use of this predator species as a sentinel of the marine trophic system in one of the least studied areas within this species' distributional range.

J	Frazer, TK; Quetin, LB; Ross, RM				Frazer, TK; Quetin, LB; Ross, RM			Abundance, sizes and developmental stages of larval krill, Euphausia superba, during winter in ice-covered seas west of the Antarctic Peninsula	JOURNAL OF PLANKTON RESEARCH												Larval krill were sampled west of the Antarctic Peninsula during three winter cruises: September 1991, June 1993 and September 1993. Larval abundances were estimated from net catches and compared directly to visual counts (made by a SCUBA diver) of larvae occupying the ice habitat at the same sampling stations. The number of larvae per square meter sampled with nets was more often greater than that observed by the diver, irrespective of the sampling period. However, comparisons of larval abundance within sampling periods were not statistically significant. Larval krill collected by divers were significantly larger than those collected with nets for each of the three cruises. The stage composition of larval krill also depended on the collection method: net-collected samples contained a disproportionately high number of early furcilia larvae in June 1993 (early winter), and a disproportionately low number of early juveniles during September 1991 and 1993 (late winter). These results lead us to suggest that larval/juvenile krill occupy both the water column and sea ice habitat during the austral winter, and that there are often differences in the sizes and developmental stages of the two groups. For larval krill that occupied the sea ice habitat, aggregations were larger and more numerous during late winter than in early winter. In addition, larvae within aggregations occupied structurally complex microhabitats, provided by over-rafted ice floes, more often than they occupied smooth, downward-facing ice surfaces where ice was not over-rafted.																	0142-7873					OCT	2002	24	10					1067	1077		10.1093/plankt/24.10.1067							WOS:000178558900009						
J	Croxall, JP; Nicol, S				Croxall, JP; Nicol, S			Management of Southern Ocean fisheries: global forces and future sustainability	ANTARCTIC SCIENCE												The marine resources of the Antarctic region are of global significance. In managing Southern Ocean marine resources, especially fisheries, the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR) has adopted principles that aim: to balance harvesting and conservation; to protect the needs of dependent species, and to avoid changes that are irreversible in 20-30 years. CCAMLR has pioneered ecosystem approaches to fishery and environmental management, through the incorporation of precaution and uncertainty into its management procedures and by establishing an ecosystem monitoring programme using indicator species and processes. This pioneering application of precautionary and ecosystem approaches in the management of harvesting has met with some success, notably in applying conservative yield models for toothfish and krill stocks and in establishing strict rules for undertaking new and exploratory fisheries. However, toothfish management has been recently compromised by Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated (IUU) fishing which is driven by forces outside the Southern Ocean. Southern Ocean harvestable resources are also subject to other global forces such as environmental changes, and their management systems remain very vulnerable to rapid shifts in worldwide fishery economics, and to inadequate management in adjacent areas, particularly high seas. CCAMLR needs quickly to develop the basis of more flexible and effective management to cater for rapid shifts in capacity and demand. The complementary task, however, is to raise the management standard of other Regional Fisheries Management Organisations (RFMOs) to those of CCAMLR if global high seas marine resources are to be sustainable for the rest of this century.																	0954-1020	1365-2079				DEC	2004	16	4					569	584		10.1017/S0954102004002330							WOS:000226060800016

Data collected during 14 demersal fish surveys, from 1986 to 2006, are analysed to investigate biomass, distribution, growth and diet. Biomass estimates from a swept area method ranged from 4,462 to 28,740 tonnes on the South Georgia and Shag Rock shelves although few fish were caught at Shag Rocks. Analysis of length frequency data indicated that growth was fast in the first five years with males and females attaining lengths at first spawning of 440 mm TL and 520 mm TL. The diet was comprised of fish and crustaceans, with an ontogenetic shift in diet from Euphausia superba and mysids to benthic fish and decapods observed to begin at 250 mm TL. In larger fish (> 500 mm TL) the diet was dominated by fish. C. aceratus diet is sufficiently different from the other species of channichthyids around South Georgia to suggest that these species have undergone resource partitioning.				, Martin/ABE-6728-2020; Collins, Martin A/J-8560-2017; Reid, William/J-8528-2013	Reid, William/0000-0003-0190-0425												0722-4060	1432-2056				NOV	2007	30	12					1523	1533		10.1007/s00300-007-0313-z							WOS:000249920800002

Ecological drivers of change at South Georgia: the krill surplus, or climate variability	ECOGRAPHY												Macaroni penguins Eudyptes chrysolophus are thought to be one of the most important mesopredators in the Southern Ocean having a greater impact on prey availability and abundance than any other seabird species. Their population centre has long been held to be South Georgia where populations were thought to comprise many million animals. Here we report the results of a recent census of the macaroni population at South Georgia undertaken using aerial survey methods. We report dramatic declines in numbers (similar to 1.0 million breeding pairs) compared to numbers observed in the late 1970s (similar to 5.4 million pairs), but show that these reductions have occurred principally at sites where numbers had previously been very large. During the breeding season, the main foraging grounds of birds from these sites overlap with the foraging grounds of Antarctic fur seals Arctocephalus gazella, a major competitor for their principal prey, Antarctic krill Euphausia superba. We suggest that the redistribution of the macaroni penguin population at South Georgia reflects the recent recovery of fur seal populations and thus the ongoing consequences of human intervention at South Georgia, a process which started more than 2 centuries previously. The implied resource competition and the observed population changes may also be exacerbated by recent reductions in Antarctic krill abundance which have been linked with reductions in seasonal sea ice following recent, rapid, regional warming in the Antarctic; however, the recovery of fur seal populations, and the ongoing recovery of krill-eating whale populations argues that tropho-dynamic interactions may be sufficient to explain the observed changes.

Diet of a specialist in a changing environment: the crabeater seal along the western Antarctic Peninsula	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												Although crabeater seals Lobodon carcinophaga are among the most abundant consumers of Antarctic krill Euphausia superba, their diet has rarely been studied throughout most of the species' range. Using delta C-13 and delta N-15 values in vibrissae from 53 seals, we examined the trophic ecology of crabeater seals from the western Antarctic Peninsula (wAP) in 2001, 2002 and 2007. We observed a wide variability in individual seal mean delta C-13 values, which ranged from -19.8 parts per thousand to -24.9 parts per thousand, whereas mean delta N-15 value varied from 5.4 parts per thousand to 7.9 parts per thousand. We identified a positive significant effect of seal mass on delta C-13 values, as well as a significant seasonal effect (higher delta C-13 values in austral winter), which likely resulted from changes in the composition of the community of primary producers. delta N-15 values for crabeater seals, on the other hand, were affected by year, with individuals in 2002 having higher delta N-15 values. The median (with range) contribution of Antarctic krill to the diet of crabeater seals, as estimated using the Bayesian mixing model MixSIR, was 87.9% (81.2 to 94.8%). During 2002, krill biomass in the wAP was at one of its lowest levels during the last 2 decades, coinciding with a slight reduction in the importance of krill for the diet of the seals that year, which reached 84.5% (75.1 to 92.4%). Despite the relative plasticity observed in the diet of crabeater seals, it is unknown to what extent, and at what rate, crabeater seals might be able to switch to a more generalized diet, which might impact their fitness, given the ongoing environmental change along the wAP.

Southern Right Whale (Eubalaena australis) Reproductive Success is Influenced by Krill (Euphausia superba) Density and Climate	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS												The reproductive success of southern right whale (Eubalaena australis) depends on body condition and, therefore, on foraging success. This, in turn, might be affected by climatically driven change in the abundance of the species main prey, krill (Euphausia superba), on the feeding grounds. Annual data on southern right whale number of calves were obtained from aerial surveys carried out between 1997 and 2013 in southern Brazil, where the species concentrate during their breeding season. The number of calves recorded each year varied from 7 to 43 ((x) over bar = 21.11 +/- 11.88). Using cross-correlation analysis we examined the response of the species to climate anomalies and krill densities. Significant correlations were found with krill densities (r = 0.69, p = 0.002, lag 0 years), Oceanic Nino Index (r = -0.65, p = 0.03, lag 6 years), Antarctic Oscillation (r = 0.76, p = 0.01, lag 7 years) and Antarctic sea ice area (r = -0.68, p = 0.002, lag 0 years). Our results suggest that global climate indices influence southern right whale breeding success in southern Brazil by determining variation in food (krill) availability for the species. Therefore, increased frequency of years with reduced krill abundance, due to global warming, is likely to reduce the current rate of recovery of southern right whales from historical overexploitation.

During this period catches reported by the Soviet fleet amounted to more than 95% of the total catch. The calculations were based on haul-by-haul data from the Soviet fleet, using a probability statistical theory of fishery systems developed at AtlantNIRO. The impact of the commercial fleet on the krill population - on biomass and the density of krill aggregated in the fishing grounds - was assessed using data from 22 800 hauls. The results of this study indicate that during periods of maximum fishing intensity, the Soviet fishing fleet had no impact on the krill stock or, consequently, on krill-dependent predators. It is concluded that although there is a spatial overlap of the dependent species and the fishery, this is not sufficient to amount to a functional overlap.																	1023-4063						2003	10						15	35									WOS:000188512300002

Total lipid, lipid classes, fatty acids, fatty alcohols and sterols were analyzed in animals among several life stages. Lipids in seston and major copepods representing potential diets were collected from the water column and quantified to compare with krill. Stomach contents also were examined in selected adult krill to provide a visual snapshot of ingested material and comparison with lipid biomarkers. Total lipids in adult E. crystallorophias were significantly higher than adult E. superba (30.0% and 20.2% of dry weight, respectively). Wax esters were the major storage lipid in E. crystallorophias, accounting for over half (mean of 55.9%) of the total lipid in adult animals. In contrast, K superba contained triacylglycerols as the dominant storage lipid in adults (mean of 45.5% of total lipid). Fatty acid and sterol distributions in krill showed minor differences between species and life stages. Larval krill, however, contained higher polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) than sub- and adult krill. While only trace amounts of fatty alcohols were found in E superba, significant amounts were found in E. crystallorophias, particularly 14:0 and 16:0, which were major components of wax esters. Results for lipid classes, individual lipids, and stomach content suggest that E superba is less dependent on stored lipid for overwintering than E crystallorophias. E superba are omnivorous, with copepods representing a significant dietary source for adults in winter. Furciliae of both species contain lower levels of lipid storage in winter and feed largely on detritus or organisms associated with ice. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Strain 116 was previously isolated from the stomach of a specimen of the Antartic krill Euphasia superba Dana and tentatively characterized as Sphingomonas paucimobilis 116. The 16S rDNA sequence analysis showed that the strain is in fact related to species of the genus Psychrohactex; next to Psychrobacter glacincola (97.4% similarity). Sequence similarities between strain 116 and other Psychrobacter species ranged from 96.9% (with P. urativorans) to 95.4% (with P. immobilis). Key phenotypic characteristics as well as chemotaxonomic features of the bacterium were congruent with the description of the genus Psychrobacter i.e. cells were strictly aerobic, strongly oxidase-positive, psychrotrophic, halotolerant, Gram-negative non-motile coccobacilli, with ubiquinone-8 as the main respiratory lipoquinone and 18:1 cis 9, 16:1 cis and 17:1 (omega 8c being the predominant cellular fatty acids. The G+C content of the DNA was 43.6 mot%. DNA-DNA hybridization studies showed chat the relatedness between strain 116 and Psychrobacter glacincola is only 62.2%. Further differences were apparent in whale-cell SDS-PAGE: protein pattern, cellular fatty acid profile and in a number of physiological and biochemical characteristics as well as in enzymatic activities. tolerance to 5% bile sails, nitrate reduction, citrate utilization, acid production from carbohydrates, alkaline phosphatase, acid phosphatase, C4 esterase, C14 lipase and valine arylamidase were found to differentiate strain 116 from Psychrobacter glacincola. On the basis of this phenotypic and molecular evidences, strain 116, previously known as Sphingomonas paucimobilis 116, was recognized as a new species of the genus Psychrobacter for which the name Psychrobacter proteolyticus is proposed. Strain 116 has been deposited in the Collection de I'Intsitut Pasteur, France, as CIP106830(T) and in the Deutsche: Sammlung von Mikroorganismen and Zellkulturen, as DSM13887(.)(T)					Denner, Ewald B.

A partially purified krill extract (enzymatic debrider) intended for clinical use was electrophoretically characterized by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and by crossed immunoelectrophoresis (CIE) using polyclonal rabbit antibodies. 2. Three main types of proteolytic enzymes (serine proteinase, carboxypeptidase A and B) with mol. wts of 33,000, 28,000 and 35,000, respectively, could be separated by SDS-g-PAGE under reducing conditions. 3. Routine CIE analysis of krill samples revealed four protease-active immunoprecipitates. Two of these precipitates were associated with the proteinase activity, one with carboxypeptidase A and one with carboxypeptidase B. 4. Improving resolution of CIE by extending electrophoresis in the first dimension permitted separation of three serine proteinases of which two were isozymes (II and III) and the third one was unique (1). 5. Furthermore carboxypeptidase A could also be separated into two isozymes (AI and AII) while carboxypeptidase B still exhibited one single component. 6. Six individual immunoprecipitates were thus identified and proved to be related to the protease activity. Highly purified enzymes were used as references in CIE and tandem-CIE to establish identification of each enzyme in the krill mixture.																	0305-0491						1991	100	4					817	820		10.1016/0305-0491(91)90296-P							WOS:A1991GY67700027

Swimming capacity measured as propulsive force can be estimated by attaching the animal to a virtually friction free rotational displacement transducer with an arm allowing only forward and backward movements. The method also allows determination of beat rates of the pleopod cycle. Results from the use of the method on different sizes, sexes and moult stages of Northern krill Aleganyctiphanes norvegica indicate that the swimming capacity of krill increases with the size of the animal, although pleopod beat frequency decreases with increasing size of the animal. We found no difference in swimming capacity between females and males, but female krill had a higher pleopod beat frequency than males. The moult stage of the animal affects the swimming capacity, with newly moulted krill being weaker swimmers. It also affects pleopod beat frequency, with newly moulted krill having the lowest frequency. We argue that results of this kind may be useful in attempts to interpret observed demographic distribution patterns in migration studies as well as in studies of krill population dynamics.

This squeezed fluid adjusted to pH 7 was subjected to spontaneous autolysis by storing at different temperatures (20-45-degrees-C) and times (10-48 h). The autolyzed material resulted in 3 distinct phases after high speed centrifugation. The intermediate phase (water-phase) was collected and concentrated by membrane filtration. The high-molecular-weight substances (> 10 000 Daltons) were further purified by ion-exchange chromatography and eluted by a salt gradient. In this matter a bulk enzymatic material from krill can be efficiently obtained for further purification of different hydrolytic enzymes (peptide hydrolases/carbohydrases).																	0032-7484						1991	21	4					237	256		10.1080/10826069108018576							WOS:A1991GW40800006	1780275

Marine and terrestrial factors affecting Adelie penguin Pygoscelis adeliae chick growth and recruitment off the western Antarctic Peninsula	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												An individual-based bioenergetics model that simulates the growth of an Adelie penguin Pygoscelis adeliae chick from hatching to fledging was used to assess marine and terrestrial factors that affect chick growth and fledging mass off the western Antarctic Peninsula. Simulations considered the effects on Adelie penguin fledging mass of (1) modification of chick diet through the addition of Antarctic silverfish Pleuragramma antarcticum to an all-Antarctic krill Euphausia superba diet, (2) reduction of provisioning rate which may occur as a result of an environmental stress such as reduced prey availability, and (3) increased thermoregulatory costs due to wetting of chicks which may result from increased precipitation or snow-melt in colonies. Addition of 17% Antarctic silverfish of Age-Class 3 yr (AC3) to a penguin chick diet composed of Antarctic krill increased chick fledging mass by 5%. Environmental stress that results in > 4% reduction in provisioning rate or wetting of just 10% of the chick's surface area decreased fledging mass enough to reduce the chick's probability of successful recruitment. The negative effects of reduced provisioning and wetting on chick growth can be compensated for by inclusion of Antarctic silverfish of AC3 and older in the chick diet. Results provide insight into climate-driven processes that influence chick growth and highlight a need for field research designed to investigate factors that determine the availability of AC3 and older Antarctic silverfish to foraging Adelie penguins and the influence of snowfall on chick wetting, thermoregulation and adult provisioning rate.																	0171-8630	1616-1599					2011	436						273	289		10.3354/meps09242							WOS:000294619800020

Oasis MCX mixed-mode adsorbent (Waters GmbH, Eschborn, Germany) shows a high binding capacity for Se-Met. The adsorbed selenoamino acid is easily eluted by pH change and addition of organic solvent. Determined adsorption isotherm parameters are suitable for its analytical and preparative chromatographic isolation. A chromatographic column packed with the Oasis MCX adsorbent, designed for a single use solid phase extraction, was successfully applied for bifunctional chromatographic separation of Se-Met from hydrolysed Antarctic krill samples with 85 +/- 5% recovery. The MCX-packed column was used for more than 60 runs without any change in its performance.																	0009-5893					FEB	2008	67	3-4					305	308		10.1365/s10337-007-0494-1							WOS:000252806200016

We deployed a three-site high-frequency radar network that provided hourly surface circulation maps over the Palmer Deep hotspot. A series of particle release experiments were used to estimate surface residence time and connectivity across the canyon. The majority of residence times fell between 1.0 and 3.5 days, with a mean of 2 days and a maximum of 5 days. We found a highly significant negative relationship between wind speed and residence time. Our residence time analysis indicates that the elevated phytoplankton biomass over the central canyon is transported into and out of the hotspot on time scales much shorter than the observed phytoplankton growth rate, suggesting that the canyon may not act as an incubator of phytoplankton productivity as previously suggested. It may instead serve more as a conveyor belt of phytoplankton biomass produced elsewhere, continually replenishing the phytoplankton biomass for the local Antarctic krill community, which in turn supports numerous top predators.

Human activities and long-range pollutants are increasing on the Antarctic continent. Research on persistent organic pollutants (POPs) has been carried out internationally by several countries having their permanent research stations to explain the impact of an ever increasing range of POPs in Antarctic ecosystem. POPs have been detected in Antarctica despite its geographical isolation and almost complete absence of human settlements. The presence of POPs in different abiotic (atmosphere, water bodies, sediments, soil, sea ice) and biotic components (mosses, lichens, krill, penguins, skua, etc.) in Antarctica has been studied and documented around for decades and has either been banned or strictly regulated but is still found in the environment. This review focuses on recent research pertaining to sources and occurrence of POPs in Antarctic lake water, soil, sediment, lichen, mosses and other Antarctic marine community. This review also proposes to summarize the current state of research on POPs in Antarctica environment and draw the earliest conclusions on possible significance of POPs in Antarctica based on presently available information from related Antarctic environment.

However, the action of KO in lowering blood pressure (BP) has not been studied yet. Therefore the aim of this study was to assess the ability of long-term KO supplementation to lower systolic BP (SBP) in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) and Sprague Dawley (SD) rats. RESULTS: Comparedwith the blank control (BC) SHRs administered edible soybean oil, the high-dose (500mgkg(-1) body weight (BW)) KO-supplemented SHRs in the 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 5th weeks following oral administration, the mid-dose (100mgkg(-1) BW) KO-supplemented SHRs in the 4th and 5th weeks following oral administration and the low-dose (20mg kg(-1) BW) KO-supplemented SHRs in the 5th week following oral administration showed significantly lower SBP (P < 0.05). However, supplementation of KO had no significant effect on the SBP of healthy SD rats. Meanwhile, 5 weeks of KO administration significantly increased the serum levels of nitric oxide (NO) and total NO synthase of SHRs (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: KO has an antihypertensive effect in SHRs that is associated with an NO-relatedmechanism.

Both are essential components of the Southern Ocean ecosystem, but occupy distinct environmental geographical locations with slightly different temperature regimes. They therefore provide a useful model system for the investigation of adaptations to thermal tolerance. Methodology/Principal Finding Initial CTmax studies showed that E. superba was slightly more thermotolerant than E. crystallorophias. Five Hsp70 mRNAs were characterized from the RNAseq data of both species and subsequent expression kinetics studies revealed notable differences in induction of each of the 5 orthologues between the two species, with E. crystallorophias reacting more rapidly than E. superba. Furthermore, analyses conducted to estimate the evolutionary rates and selection strengths acting on each gene tended to support the hypothesis that diversifying selection has contributed to the diversification of this gene family, and led to the selective relaxation on the inducible C form with its possible loss of function in the two krill species. Conclusions The sensitivity of the epipelagic species E. crystallorophias to temperature variations and/or its adaptation to cold is enhanced when compared with its sister species, E. superba. These results indicate that ice krill could be the first of the two species to be impacted by the warming of coastal waters of the Austral ocean in the coming years due to climate change.				corre, erwan/O-4669-2019; Clark, Melody S/D-7371-2014	corre, erwan/0000-0001-6354-2278; Clark, Melody S/0000-0002-3442-3824; Papot, Claire/0000-0002-8324-2261												1932-6203					APR 2	2015	10	4							e0121642	10.1371/journal.pone.0121642							WOS:000352139000053	25835552

Nearshore studies have focused on physical mechanisms driving primary production and penguin foraging, but less is known about finer-scale krill distribution and density. We designed two acoustic survey grids paired with conductivity-temperature-depth profiles within adjacent Adelie and gentoo penguin foraging regions near Palmer Station, Antarctica. The grids were sampled from January to March 2019 to assess variability in krill availability and associations with oceanographic properties. Krill density was similar in the two regions, but krill swarms were longer and larger in the gentoo foraging region, which was also less stratified and had lower chlorophyll concentrations. In the inshore zone near penguin colonies, depth-integrated krill density increased from summer to autumn (January-March) independent of chlorophyll concentration, suggesting a life history-driven adult krill migration rather than a resource-driven biomass increase. The daytime depth of krill biomass deepened through the summer and became decoupled from the chlorophyll maximum in March as diel vertical migration magnitude likely increased. Penguins near Palmer Station did not appear to be limited by krill availability during our study, and regional differences in krill depth match the foraging behaviors of the two penguin species. Understanding fine-scale physical forcing and ecological interactions in coastal Antarctic hotspots is critical for predicting how environmental change will impact these ecosystems.				schofield, oscar/H-4169-2018	schofield, oscar/0000-0003-2359-4131; Fraser, William/0000-0003-4946-1783; Steinberg, Deborah/0000-0001-9884-4655; Nardelli, Schuyler/0000-0001-7926-9018; Conroy, Jack/0000-0001-6559-8240												0024-3590	1939-5590				JUN	2021	66	6					2234	2250		10.1002/lno.11750		MAY 2021					WOS:000646459700001

Projected shifts in the foraging habitat of crabeater seals along the Antarctic Peninsula	NATURE CLIMATE CHANGE												Crabeater seals exhibit extreme dietary specialization, feeding almost exclusively on Antarctic krill. This specialization has inextricably linked habitat use, life history and evolution of this pinniped species to the distribution of its prey. Therefore, the foraging habitat of crabeater seals can be used to infer the distribution of Antarctic krill. Here, we combined seal movements and diving behaviour with environmental variables to build a foraging habitat model for crabeater seals for the rapidly changing western Antarctic Peninsula (WAP). Our projections show that future crabeater seal foraging habitat and, by inference, krill distribution will expand towards offshore waters and the southern WAP in response to changes in circulation, water temperature and sea ice distribution. Antarctic krill biomass is projected to be negatively affected by the environmental changes, which are anticipated to manifest as a decrease in krill densities in coastal waters, with impacts on the land-/ice-based krill predator community, particularly in the northern WAP. Crabeater seals feed predominantly on Antarctic krill. Combining seal tracks and diving behaviour with environmental variables allows the future foraging habitat, and therefore krill distribution, to be predicted, suggesting a shift offshore and south along the western Antarctic Peninsula.

Inclusion levels were 0.000, 4.125, 8.250, and 12.375% (control, KM4.125, KM8.250, and KM12.375, respectively), and groups of large-sized fish (average body weight = 190.6 g) received these diets for 99 d. No significant differences were found in body length, body weight, and specific growth rate compared with the control group, but the KM4.125 and KM8.250 groups had significantly increased condition factors and hepatosomatic indices. The KM8.250 fish showed a significant increase in redness values in the dorsal skin, while the KM12.375 fish presented significantly higher yellowness in the ventral skin and tail fin. Addition of krill meal exerted no significant effect on whole-body proximate composition. The KM8.250 group showed significantly higher lipid content and lower ash content, which differed from those of the KM12.375 group. Most of the amino acids in muscle and liver tissues remained unchanged compared to those in the control. The KM4.125 group showed significantly higher muscle proline, serine, and total functional amino acids, while the total amino acid content in KM12.375 fish significantly decreased. The results indicated that dietary inclusion of fish meal with up to 8.25% krill meal does not result in adverse effects on growth and body composition of large-sized Large Yellow Croaker; however, addition of krill meal could improve skin coloration in these fish.																	1522-2055	1548-8454				OCT	2021	83	4					255	266		10.1002/naaq.10185		AUG 2021					WOS:000689684400001

These findings correlated well with biochemical data on the three serine proteinases. Enzyme I is able to liberate free amino acids from polypeptides in comparison with enzyme II and III (classical true endopeptidases), which do not. We suggest that these unique biochemical properties also have their immunological counterpart expressed as other antigenic determinants of the molecular structure.																	0722-4060	1432-2056				DEC	1991	11	7					495	500									WOS:A1991GU47800010

In addition, a total of 135 Rectangular Midwater Trawls (RMT8) were undertaken to determine the structure of the krill population and to validate acoustic target detection techniques. This paper reports a comparison of the density estimates derived from net and acoustic sampling for a range of spatial scales; from individual net hauls to regional estimates of krill biomass. The different sources of error and the different characteristics of the density estimates from net and acoustic techniques are also defined. Direct quantitative comparisons of net and acoustic densities are shown to be inappropriate at both the small scale (i.e. individual net tows; the typical net sampling unit for census surveys) and the large scale (i.e. regional surveys). Therefore, a direct comparison of density estimates from net and acoustic surveys is not practicable for retrospective analysis of krill abundance. However, the results of net and acoustic surveys do appear comparable in terms of trends in krill distribution at the large scale. Therefore, the combined use of net and acoustic data can be useful in the analysis of interannual trends in the variability of krill distribution at the regional level. At the local level, data from trawl surveys using comparable nets can be used to examine interannual variability in krill distribution as there has been little change in the methodology used for net surveys over the last 25 years.

Divergent trophic responses of sympatric penguin species to historic anthropogenic exploitation and recent climate change	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA												The Southern Ocean is in an era of significant change. Historic overharvesting of marine mammals and recent climatic warming have cascading impacts on resource availability and, in turn, ecosystem structure and function. We examined trophic responses of sympatric chinstrap (Pygoscelis antarctica) and gentoo (Pygoscelis papua) penguins to nearly 100 y of shared environmental change in the Antarctic Peninsula region using compound-specific stable isotope analyses of museum specimens. A century ago, gentoo penguins fed almost exclusively on low-trophic level prey, such as krill, during the peak of historic overexploitation of marine mammals, which was hypothesized to have resulted in a krill surplus. In the last 40 y, gentoo penguin trophic position has increased a full level as krill declined in response to recent climate change, increased competition from recovering marine mammal populations, and the development of a commercial krill fishery. A shifting isotopic baseline supporting gentoo penguins suggests a concurrent increase in coastal productivity over this time. In contrast, chinstrap penguins exhibited no change in trophic position, despite variation in krill availability over the past century. The specialized foraging niche of chinstrap penguins likely renders them more sensitive to changes in krill availability, relative to gentoo penguins, as evinced by their declining population trends in the Antarctic Peninsula over the past 40 y. Over the next century, similarly divergent trophic and population responses are likely to occur among Antarctic krill predators if climate change and other anthropogenic impacts continue to favor generalist over specialist species.

In this study, we investigated the acute postprandial bioavailability of amino acids (AAs) from a krill protein hydrolysate compared to a soy and a whey protein isolate. Methods: the study was a randomized, placebo-controlled crossover trial including ten healthy young males. On four non-consecutive days, volunteers consumed water or one of three protein-matched supplements: whey protein isolate, soy protein isolate or krill protein hydrolysate. Blood samples were collected prior to and until 180 min after consumption. Serum postprandial AA concentrations were determined using H-1 NMR spectroscopy. Hunger and satiety were assessed using visual analogue scales (VAS). Results: whey and krill resulted in significantly higher AA concentrations compared to soy between 20-60 min and 20-40 min after consumption, respectively. Area under the curve (AUC) analyses revealed that whey resulted in the highest postprandial serum concentrations of essential AAs (EAAs) and branched chain AAs (BCAAs), followed by krill and soy, respectively. Conclusions: krill protein hydrolysate increases postprandial serum EAA and BCAA concentrations in a superior manner to soy protein isolate and thus might represent a promising future protein source in human nutrition.

Plasma choline, homocysteine and vitamin status in healthy adults supplemented with krill oil: a pilot study	SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF CLINICAL & LABORATORY INVESTIGATION												Plasma concentrations of metabolites along the choline oxidation and tryptophan degradation pathways have been linked to lifestyle diseases and dietary habits. This study aimed to investigate how krill oil, a source of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) with a high phosphatidylcholine content, affected these parameters. The pilot study was conducted as a 28 days intervention in 17 healthy volunteers (18-36 years), who received a supplement of 4.5 g krill oil per day, providing 833 mg omega-3 PUFAs, and 1750 mg phosphatidylcholine. Krill oil supplementation increased fasting plasma choline (+28.4%, p < .001), betaine (+26.6%, p < .001), dimethylglycine (+33.7%, p < .001) and sarcosine (+16.8%, p < .001), whereas no statistically significant changes were seen for plasma glycine, serine, methionine, total homocysteine, cysteine, cystathionine, methionine sulfoxide, folate, cobalamin, B-2-, B-3-, and B-6 vitamers, tryptophan, kynurenines, nicotinamide, vitamin A and vitamin E. In summary, krill oil supplementation influenced choline metabolite levels, but not plasma metabolites of the tryptophan-kynurenine-nicotinamide pathways and vitamins. These observations should be confirmed in a placebo-controlled trial, including an omega-3 PUFA supplement without phospholipids to explore the potential additive effects of the different active ingredients.

Paleodietary changes by penguins and seals in association with Antarctic climate and sea ice extent	CHINESE SCIENCE BULLETIN												Positioned near the top of the food web, the dietary composition of Antarctic penguins and seals can be an excellent indicator of the regional food web and thus the status of the marine ecosystem. The dietary composition of modern penguins and seals has been well investigated; a long-term time series of data on penguin and seal diets, however, are rare. Such data, especially any predating the initiation of human harvesting of fish, whales and seals in Antarctica, are crucial for understanding and predicting responses of regional marine food webs to natural climate changes. Here we review recent progress on research of paleodietary change in Antarctic penguins and seals, specifically the Ad,lie penguin (Pygoscelis adeliae) and Antarctic fur seal (Arctocephalus gazella). These studies indicate that the dietary changes of penguins correspond quite well with fluctuations in climate and sea ice extent during the Holocene. The depleted delta N-15 ratios found in modern Ad,lie penguins support the "krill surplus hypothesis" in relation to historic human depletion of krill-eating fish, seals and whales.																	1001-6538	1861-9541				NOV	2014	59	33					4456	4464		10.1007/s11434-014-0300-z							WOS:000344321500010

Effect of animal-borne camera and flash on the diving behaviour of the female Antarctic fur seal (Arctocephalus gazella)	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART I-OCEANOGRAPHIC RESEARCH PAPERS												Studies have documented effects of drag created by data-logging units attached to seals, but the effect of visual stimuli from such units has not been investigated. We evaluated potential effects of camera attachment including near-infrared flash operation by comparing the diving behaviour of 15 female Antarctic fur seals (Arctocephalus gazella) with cameras and 10 seals without cameras. Irrespective of the presence of the camera or flash, all seals exhibited an expected diel dive pattern with shallower, shorter dives, less time at the bottom of a dive, and slower ascent and descent rates at night following krill vertical migration. We also observed a previously unreported foraging trip dive pattern with faster ascents and descents near the end of trips. With cameras present, dive duration and bottom time increased and ascents were slower. During flash operation, dive duration increased and bottom time remained constant throughout the day contrary to the expected diel trend. Also during flash operation, bottom time was shorter at the beginning of a foraging trip and dives were deeper, with longer duration and bottom time later in the trip. We were unable to conclude whether the flash emission spectrum overlapped with the visual sensitivity of seals and Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) since visual sensitivity data for seals and krill at longer wavelengths were not available. It is possible that the flash was bright enough for the seals or krill to detect; however, although there was a change in diving behaviour observed during flash operation this behaviour was within the range of values normally observed for these seals and should not cause ethical concern.

Organochlorine pesticide air-water exchange and bioconcentration in krill in the Ross Sea	ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION												Mean hexachlorobenzene (HCB) and hexachlorocyclohexane (HCH) concentrations, measured in seawater and air samples, confirmed the decline in levels of these compounds in Antarctic air and water. However, low alpha/gamma-HCH ratios in air at the beginning of the sampling period suggest a predominance of fresh lindane entering the Antarctic atmosphere during the Austral spring probably due to current use in the Southern Hemisphere. Water-air fugacity ratios demonstrate the potential for HCH gas deposition to coastal Antarctic seas, while the water-air fugacity ratios for HCB imply that volatilization does not account for the observed decrease of HCB in surface seawater. HCH concentrations found in krill samples were correlated with seawater concentrations indicative of bioconcentration of HCHs from seawater. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

West Antarctic Peninsula: An Ice-Dependent Coastal Marine Ecosystem in Transition	OCEANOGRAPHY												The extent, duration, and seasonality of sea ice and glacial discharge strongly influence Antarctic marine ecosystems. Most organisms' life cycles in this region are attuned to ice seasonality The annual retreat and melting of sea ice in the austral spring stratifies the upper ocean, triggering large phytoplankton blooms. The magnitude of the blooms is proportional to the winter extent of ice cover, which can act as a barrier to wind mixing. Antarctic krill, one of the most abundant metazoan populations on Earth, consume phytoplankton blooms dominated by large diatoms. Krill, in turn, support a large biomass of predators, including penguins, seals, and whales. Human activity has altered even these remote ecosystems. The western Antarctic Peninsula region has warmed by 7 degrees C over the past 50 years, and sea ice duration has declined by almost 100 days since 1978, causing a decrease in phytoplankton productivity in the northern peninsula region. Besides climate change, Antarctic marine systems have been greatly altered by harvesting of the great whales and now krill. It is unclear to what extent the ecosystems we observe today differ from the pristine state.

To date, the potential implications of this population shift on the biogeochemical cycling of the limiting micronutrient iron (Fe) and its bioavailability to SO phytoplankton has never been tested. Based on uptake of fecal pellet (FP)released Fe by SO phytoplankton, this study highlights how efficiently krill and salps recycle Fe. To test this, we collected FPs of natural populations of salps and krill, added them to the same SO phytoplankton community, andmeasured the community's Fe uptake rates. Our results reveal that both FP additions yielded similar dissolved iron concentrations in the seawater. Per FP carbon added to the seawater, 4.8 +/- 1.5 times more Fe was taken up by the same phytoplankton community from salp FP than from krill FP, suggesting that salp FP increased the Fe bioavailability, possibly through the release of ligands. With respect to the ongoing shift from krill to salps, the potential for carbon fixation of the Fe-limited SO could be strengthened in the future, representing a negative feedback to climate change.

Most zooplankton had low percentages of wax esters (0-8%, as percent of total lipid). High triacylglycerol levels were found in the hyperiid amphipod Themisto gaudichaudii (68%, as percent of total lipid), the krill (Euphausiacea) Euphausia tricantha (44-54% triacylglycerol) and Euphausia frigida (27% triacylglycerol) and the scyphomedusan Periphylla periphylla (42-48% triacylglycerol). Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) comprised 23-60% of the total fatty acids, with the omega-3 fatty acids eicosapentaenoic acid [20:5(n-3)] and docosahexaenoic acid [22:6(n-3)] being most abundant. P. periphylla was an exception with 12-19% docosapentaenoic acid [22:5 (n-3)] being the major PUFA. The major euphausiid sterols included cholesterol (75-92%, as percent of total sterols) and desmosterol (6-22%). The major sterols of other zooplankton were more diverse and included trans-dehydrocholesterol, 24-methylenecholesterol, brassicasterol and 24-nordehydrocholesterol. The benthic ascidian, Distaplia cylindrica, had 45% stanols, as percent of total sterols, whereas the pelagic ascidian Salpa thompsonii had only 8-11% stanols. Lipid, fatty acid and sterol data are used to examine trophodynamic interactions and provide an ability to distinguish herbivorous and carnivorous diets and determine survival and reproductive strategies.

The surveys were conducted during the same austral summer as the CCAMLR 2000 Survey in the Scotia Sea (Watkins et al., Deep-Sea Research, II, this issue [doi: 10.1016/j.dsr2.2004.06.010]), and the data were analyzed in a similar manner. Biomass densities were not significantly different between the surveys and averaged 49 g m(-2). Maps of krill biomass indicate three areas of consistently high density: one near the eastern end of Elephant Island, one mid-way between Elephant Island and King George Island, and one near Cape Shirreff on the north side of Livingston Island. The areas of highest krill density appeared to move closer to the shelf break as the season progressed. This apparent movement was accompanied by a change in the demographic structure of the population, with smaller krill absent and a larger proportion of sexually mature animals present in late summer.

Macroalgae, gammarid amphipods and gastropods dominated the diet in the summer 1999/00 (IFA respectively 0.32, 0.32 and 0.21), at Ipanema, while macroalgae were dominant at Smok (IFA = 0.67), where krill and amphipods were secondary prey (IFA respectively 0.12 and 0.14) and gastropods were absent. Thus, the diet composition of N. coriiceps can possibly be used as an indicator of the presence of pelagic krill swarms.

Detection of tropomyosin and determination of proteins in crustacean oils	FOOD CHEMISTRY												Tropomyosin is known to be the main allergen in crustaceans and the objective of this study was to investigate if this protein could be detected in commercial crustacean oils from Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) and the zooplankton Calanus finmarchicus. We also examined the possibility of determining the protein content in the oils by direct amino acid analysis. Western blotting showed that a commercial antibody against shrimp tropomyosin cross-reacted with a protein of similar size in Antarctic krill and C. finmarchicus. The protein tentatively identified as tropomyosin, was also detected in krill oil products, but not in oils from C. finmarchicus. The acetone-heptane method used for extracting proteins in the oils is however not optimal. Other extraction methods should therefore be considered when investigating the presence of allergenic proteins in oils. Direct amino acid analysis on oils should be further explored as a method for determining the total amount of proteins present. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Vertical distribution and aggregation patterns of krill (Crustacea: Euphausiacea) in the Bay of Biscay: interannual and seasonal variability	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY												Studies of krill (Crustacea: Euphausiacea) in oceanic waters of the Bay of Biscay are scarce and restricted to the epipelagic zone, overlooking vertical dynamics such as diurnal vertical migration (DVM). There is a growing interest in acoustically evaluating the biomass of krill in this area, but this requires a good knowledge of its vertical dynamics and aggregation patterns. In this work we employed acoustic data and net samples from two consecutive annual surveys covering a wide off-shelf area of the Bay of Biscay (JUVENA surveys of 2013 and 2014) and four seasonal surveys covering slope and oceanic waters in the Cantabrian Sea (SCAPA surveys of 2015). Vertical dynamics of krill were analyzed in the frame of the environmental seascape. High interannual and seasonal variations in the vertical distribution and aggregation patterns (small swarms, dense aggregations, or loose layers) of krill were observed. The vertical distribution covaried with dissolved oxygen and salinity. According to our findings, the best season to acoustically evaluate krill in the Bay of Biscay is spring, with the bulk of the biomass located above 600 m depth.

Bottom trawl surveys on the South Georgia shelf indicate episodic declines in the abundance of the mackerel icefish Champsocephalus gunnari that, since 1990, are not directly attributable to commercial fishing. 2. The greatest effect has been observed in years when krill are known to have been scarce on the South Georgia shelf. 3. It is thought that C. gunnari survivorship is closely related to, but indirectly influenced by, krill availability. 4. Examination of food chain relationships indicates that predation by fur seals is likely to play a major role in the observed changes in C, gunnari abundance. 5. Periodic shifts in food chain relationships, involving krill, C. gunnari and fur seals, are postulated that could explain the episodic declines in the abundance of C, gunnari in the absence of fishing. 6. The study demonstrates how a key predator can have an over-riding impact on a commercial fish species, highlighting the importance of the ecosystem approach to fisheries management.																	0021-8901					AUG	1999	36	4					591	603		10.1046/j.1365-2664.1999.00425.x							WOS:000082642300012

A novel video analysis technique, applied to extract krill angle of orientation corresponding to each insonification, revealed that echo spectra from krill near broadside incidence relative to the incident acoustic wave exhibited widely spaced, deep nulls, whereas off-broadside echo spectra had a more erratic structure, with several closely spaced nulls of variable depth. The pattern of changes in echo spectra with orientation for the experimentally measured acoustic returns was very similar to theoretically predicted patterns based on a distorted wave Born approximation (DWBA) model. Information contained in the broadband echo spectra of the krill was exploited to invert the acoustic returns for angle of orientation by applying a newly developed Covariance Mean Variance Classification (CMVC) approach, using generic and animal-specific theoretical and empirical model spaces. The animal-specific empirical model space was best able to invert for angle of orientation. The CMVC inversion technique can be implemented using a generic empirical model space to determine angle of orientation based on broadband echoes from individual zooplankton in the field.

The three sparids are omnivorous and are confined to neritic habitats and the two scombrids are schooling planktivores and open-ocean forms. The experiments were conducted under three different holding conditions: grey and white tanks in the laboratory, sea cages and an earthen pond. The prey used in the tests was the Antarctic krill, in its natural colour (control) and in artificial colours of yellow, red, green, blue (produced with food dyes) and black (Chinese ink). These prey were offered in different two-colour pairs to groups of fish, and the colour of the krill attacked first was recorded. The frequencies of first attacks against each colour of the different pairs were analysed by the paired-preference test and Thurstone's law of comparative judgment. The data were converted into mean z-scores and significant biases from zero were noted. The five species took without hesitation all the krill of all colours, but preferred blue krill the least, and did not clearly distinguish red from black. The three sparids showed a strong bias for yellow krill under all holding conditions. The two scombrids preferred natural krill and showed poor colour preference. The observed colour preference was probably due to colour per se and may be an innate ability, rather than due to relative brightness (sensitivity of the fish eye), prey conspicuousness (pigmented eyes of the krill), or the associated taste of the dyes.																	1023-6244						2010	43	3					169	182	PII 923470962	10.1080/10236244.2010.486885							WOS:000279334300002

Euphausiids had the highest overall fluoride concentrations of a range of Antarctic marine crustaceans examined; levels of up to 5477 mu g g(-1) were found in the exoskeleton of Euphausia crystallorophias. Copepods had the lowest fluoride levels (0.87 mu g g(-1) whole-body); some amphipods and mysids also exhibited relatively high fluoride levels. There was no apparent relationship between the lifestyle of the crustaceans and their fluoride level, benthic and pelagic species exhibited both high and low fluoride levels. Fluoride was concentrated in the exoskeleton, but not evenly distributed through it; the exoskeleton of the head, carapace and abdomen contained the highest concentrations of fluoride, followed by the feeding basket and pleopods, and the eyes. The mouthparts of E. superba contained almost 13 000 mu g F g(-1) dry wt. Antarctic krill tail muscle had low levels of fluoride. After long-term (1 to 5 yr) storage in formalin, fluoride was almost completely lost from whole euphausiids.

Animal models that have been used in studies with KO include obesity, depression, myocardial infarction, chronic low-grade and ulcerative inflammation and are described in detail. Moreover, studies with KO in the form of krill powder (KP) and krill protein concentrate (KPC) as a mix of lipids and proteins are mentioned and compared to the effects of KO. In addition, differences in tissue uptake of the long-chain omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), when delivered in either phospholipid or triglyceride form, are addressed and the differential impact the delivery form has on gene expression profiles is explained. In our outlook, we try to highlight the potential of KO and KP supplementation in clinical settings and discuss health segments that have a high potential of showing krill product specific health benefits and warrant further clinical investigations.																	2072-6643					MAY	2015	7	5					3300	3321		10.3390/nu7053300							WOS:000356240500015	25961320

Future Risk for Southern Ocean Ecosystem Services Under Climate Change	FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE												The Southern Ocean supports ecosystem services that are important on a global scale. Climate change and human activities (tourism, fishing, and research) will affect both the demand for, and the provision of, these services into the future. Here we synthesize recent assessments of the current status and expected future climate-driven changes in Southern Ocean ecosystems and evaluate the potential consequences of these changes for the provision of ecosystem services. We explore in detail three key services (the 'blue carbon' pathway, the Antarctic krill fishery, and Antarctic tourism), tracing the consequences of climate change from physical drivers through biological impacts to the benefits to humans. We consider potential non-climatic drivers of change, current and future demands for the services, and the main global and regional policy frameworks that could be used to manage risks to the provision of these services in a changing climate. We also develop a formal representation of the network of interactions between the suite of potential drivers and the suite of services, providing a framework to capture the complexity of this network and its embedded feedback loops. Increased consideration of the linkages and feedbacks between drivers and ecosystem services will be required to underpin robust management responses into the future.

The chlorophyll and protein contents in the surface water of the corresponding stations were determined. Enzyme activities were characterized by high individual and spatial variations. Chitinolytic activity in the stomach correlated well with all digestive enzymes investigated. In the midgut gland, a correlation with cellulase and laminarinase was evident. The amount of chlorophyll a and phytoplankton protein in the surface water was not correlated with enzyme activity. Specific enzyme activity was higher in the stomach than in the midgut gland. showing individual ratios for each enzyme. Elevated endochitinase activity in the stomach suggests that chitinous food is digested to oligomers in the stomach, while the subsequent degradation to amino sugars occurs predominantly in the midgut gland.

Fishing ground selection in the Antarctic krill fishery: Trends in patterns across years, seasons and nations	CCAMLR SCIENCE												Patterns of fishing ground selection were characterised using STATLANT and CCAMLR fine-scale data. Among the 15 small-scale management units (SSMUs) within Subareas 48.1, 48.2 and 48.3, including the pelagic SSMUs, only one-third were identified as major contributors to the total catch. A recent shift in operational timing towards later months within fishing seasons was observed in Subarea 48.1 (December-February to March-May). However, operational timing has remained relatively constant in Subareas 48.2 (March-May) and 48.3 (June-August). In 25 years of krill operations in Area 48, patterns of SSMU usage have changed. Three different patterns of seasonal SSMU selection were characterised using a cluster analysis. Frequently used SSMUs did not always match the areas of high krill density observed by scientific surveys, and possible reasons for this mismatch are further discussed. A revised format for data submission is suggested in order to accommodate possible developments in fishing techniques.

Distribution, density and relative abundance of Antarctic krill estimated by maximum likelihood geostatistics on acoustic data collected during commercial fishing operations	FISHERIES RESEARCH												There is a substantial harvest for Antarctic krill in the Southern Ocean, but little regular scientific monitoring of the resource. Recently, however, the Commission for the Conservation of Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR) has initialised a process to make use of acoustic data from commercial fisheries to increase the amount of relevant information available for making management decisions. We here provide an example where 34 days of acoustic data, collected during commercial krill fishing operations on the vessel 'Saga Sea' were processed to produce probability of presence, conditional density and relative abundance estimates on monthly, weekly and daily basis. Data were analyzed using a maximum likelihood time-series and geostatistical approaches, selected to account for the lack of sampling design, and likely correlation in space and time. The applied method showed low sensitivity of monthly estimates to different repeated measure criteria and location sub-settings. Most weekly estimates, but the last one, were also consistent with the full data (monthly) estimate. Highly variable and lower estimates were obtained, however, from daily data sets. Although our results suggest the method had provided an adequate treatment for time and space correlation, we were not able to evaluate potential bias due to preferential sampling of high density krill aggregations and/or limited area coverage within short time periods. The results suggest that this method, combined with some additional design based coverage by the fishing vessels, can be useful to obtain quantitative evaluations of krill density and distribution for management purposes.

Metabolic data, elemental and biochemical composition as well as morphological parameters revealed that, at the beginning of the experiment, krill was in transition from winter to summer physiology, with some features typical for late winter/spring (low lipid reserves, low C:N ratio, elevated ON ratio) and others for summer (high respiration rates, high MDH activity, large green digestive gland, short intermoult period (IMP) and fast growth). Starvation reduced body reserves drastically by more than 1% C per day. In relative terms, lipids (40%) and glycogen (30%) were reduced most and proteins by 10% of the initial value. Absolute consumption, however, was approximately 4% DM for lipids and proteins each, whereas contribution of glycogen was negligible. Within lipids, triacylglycerols (TAG) and phospholipids (PL) fell most dramatically from already low levels by 84% and 39%, respectively. Phosphatylcholine (PC) constituted 57% of PL and declined by 46%. As a result, proportions of the lipid classes changed with sterols increasing relatively. Metabolite changes were similar in cephalothorax and abdomen, although TAG in the cephalothorax fell more drastically. High metabolic activity at the beginning of starvation was quickly reduced to reach 53% after 18 days, accompanied by a reduction in the abdominal activity of malate dehydrogenase (MDH) by 25%. Our results may provide some explanation why recruitment of some year-classes of krill fails. Despite execution of the experiment in spring (i.e. transitional physiology state) and its short duration, some changes in the activity of metabolic enzymes in the abdomen, representing lipolytic, glycolytic and proteolytic pathways, respectively, were measured. Rising activities of 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase (HOAD) and glyceralaldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) indicated increased lipolytic and glycolytic fluxes, respectively, whereas declining glutamate dehydrogenase (GluDH) activity suggests reduced proteolytic flux. Activities of other enzymes from protein catabolism, alanine aminotransferase (AlaAT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AspAT), however, remained unchanged. Ratios calculated from these trends indicated a declining importance of protein use during the course of starvation compared with consumption of lipids and glycogen. These results suggest that constant-proportion enzymes from different catabolic pathways, and calculated ratios thereof, may be useful in detecting shifts between the consumption of different body reserves.

The result shown that the krill oil extracted by alcalase and compound proteinase led to comparatively higher lipid yields (5.29% and 4.90%, respectively), Content of tocopherols and vitamin A, the content of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) and phospholipids extracted by alcalase was relatively higher. Control and alcalase had comparatively higher concentration of astaxanthin. On the whole, compared with the extraction of solvent, enzymatic hydrolysis could improve the quality and the lipid yield of krill oil. Therefore, enzymatic hydrolysis could be used as a better method to extract krill oil.																	2048-7177					JUL	2019	7	7					2224	2230		10.1002/fsn3.1017							WOS:000477059700003	31367351

The measurements of total target strength (TTS; energy scattered in all directions, averaged over all angles of incidence) match the SDWBA model (stochastic distorted-wave Born approximation) recently developed for Antarctic krill, indicating its validity for other euphausiid species with similar size and shape. However, the TTS of crustaceans with markedly different shapes are not well predicted by SDWBA derived with the generic krill shape and scaled to animal length (L). Therefore, crustacean target strength (TS) may not be estimated accurately by a linear function of log(10)(L), irrespective of shape, questioning the validity of the current TS relationship used for Antarctic krill derived from data measured from multiple crustaceans. TTS and TS are dependent upon both L and shape, and different crustaceans have significantly different shapes and width-to-length relationships. In contrast, modelled TTS and TS spectra for gravid and non-gravid krill appear to have differing amplitudes, but similar shapes. Additionally, measurements of absorption spectra from decapods indicate that the absorption cross-section increases with the volume of the animal.

Long-term (1993-2013) changes in macrozooplankton off the Western Antarctic Peninsula	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART I-OCEANOGRAPHIC RESEARCH PAPERS												The Western Antarctic Peninsula (WAP) is one of the most rapidly warming regions on Earth, and where a high apex predator biomass is supported in large part by macrozooplankton. We examined trends in summer (January-February) abundance of major taxa of macrozooplankton along the WAP over two decades (1993-2013) and their relationship with environmental parameters (sea ice, atmospheric climate indices, sea surface temperature, and phytoplankton biomass and productivity). Macrozooplankton were collected from the top 120 m of the water column in a mid-Peninsula study region divided into latitudinal (North, South, and Far South) and cross-shelf (coastal, shelf, slope) sub-regions. Trends for krill species included a 5-year cycle in abundance peaks (positive anomalies) for Euphausia superba, but no directional long-term trend, and an increase in Thysanoessa macrura in the North; variability in both species was strongly influenced by primary production 2-years prior. E. crystallorophias abundance was best explained by the Southern Annular Mode (SAM) and Multivariate El Nino Southern Oscillation Index (MEI), and was more abundant in higher ice conditions. The salp Salpa thompsoni and thecosome pteropod Limacina helicina cycled between negative and positive anomalies in the North, but showed increasing positive anomalies in the South over time. Variation in salp and pteropod abundance was best explained by SAM and the MEI, respectively, and both species were more abundant in lower ice conditions. There was a long-term increase in some carnivorous gelatinous zooplankton (polychaete worm Tomopteris spp.) and amphipods. Abundance of Pseudosagitta spp. chaetognaths was closely related to SAM, with higher abundance tied to lower ice conditions. Longterm changes and sub-decadal cycles of WAP macrozooplankton community composition may affect energy transfer to higher trophic levels, and alter biogeochemical cycling in this seasonally productive and sensitive polar ecosystem.

Carbon fluxes and pelagic ecosystem dynamics near two western Antarctic Peninsula Adelie penguin colonies: an inverse model approach	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												An inverse food-web model for the western Antarctic Peninsula (WAP) pelagic food web was constrained with data from Palmer Long Term Ecological Research (PAL-LTER) project annual austral summer sampling cruises. Model solutions were generated for 2 regions with Adelie penguin Pygoscelis adeliae colonies presenting different population trends (a northern and a southern colony) for a 12 yr period (1995-2006). Counter to the standard paradigm, comparisons of carbon flow through bacteria, microzooplankton, and krill showed that the diatom-krill-top predator food chain is not the dominant pathway for organic carbon exchanges. The food web is more complex, including significant contributions by microzooplankton and the microbial loop. Using both inverse model results and network indices, it appears that in the northern WAP the food web is dominated by the microbial food web, with a temporal trend toward its increasing importance. The dominant pathway for the southern WAP food web varies from year to year, with no detectable temporal trend toward dominance of microzooplankton versus krill. In addition, sensitivity analyses indicated that the northern colony of Adelie penguins, whose population size has been declining over the past 35 yr, appears to have sufficient krill during summer to sustain its basic metabolic needs and rear chicks, suggesting the importance of other processes in regulating the Adelie population decline.

Predicting krill swarm characteristics important for marine predators foraging off East Antarctica	ECOGRAPHY												Open ocean predator-prey interactions are often difficult to interpret because of a lack of information on prey fields at scales relevant to predator behaviour. Hence, there is strong interest in identifying the biological and physical factors influencing the distribution and abundance of prey species, which may be of broad predictive use for conservation planning and evaluating effects of environmental change. This study focuses on a key Southern Ocean prey species, Antarctic krill Euphausia superba, using acoustic observations of individual swarms (aggregations) from a large-scale survey off East Antarctica. We developed two sets of statistical models describing swarm characteristics, one set using underway survey data for the explanatory variables, and the other using their satellite remotely sensed analogues. While survey data are in situ and contemporaneous with the swarm data, remotely sensed data are all that is available for prediction and inference about prey distribution in other areas or at other times. The fitted models showed that the primary biophysical influences on krill swarm characteristics included daylight (solar elevation/radiation) and proximity to the Antarctic continental slope, but there were also complex relationships with current velocities and gradients. Overall model performance was similar regardless of whether underway or remotely sensed predictors were used. We applied the latter models to generate regional-scale spatial predictions using a 10-yr remotely-sensed time series. This retrospective modelling identified areas off east Antarctica where relatively dense krill swarms were consistently predicted during austral mid-summers, which may underpin key foraging areas for marine predators. Spatiotemporal predictions along Antarctic predator satellite tracks, from independent studies, illustrate the potential for uptake into further quantitative modelling of predator movements and foraging. The approach is widely applicable to other krill-dependent ecosystems, and our findings are relevant to similar efforts examining biophysical linkages elsewhere in the Southern Ocean and beyond.

DMSP and DMS cycling within Antarctic sea ice during the winter-spring transition	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY												This study describes within-ice concentrations of dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP), its degradation product dimethylsulphide (DMS), as well as nutrients and chlorophyll a, that were sampled during the Sea Ice Physics and Ecosystems eXperiment-2 (SIPEX-2) in 2012. DMSP is a methylated substrate produced in large amounts annually by ice-associated microalgae, while DMS plays a significant role in carbon and sulphur cycling in the Southern Ocean. In the East Antarctic study area between 115-125 degrees E and 64-66 degrees S, ice and slush cores, brine, under-ice seawater and zooplankton (Antarctic krill) samples were collected at 6 ice stations. The pack-ice was characterised by high snow loading which initiated flooding events and triggered nutrient supply to the sea-ice surface, while variation in ice conditions influenced sea-ice permeability. This ranged from impermeable surface and middle sections of the sea ice, to completely permeable ice cores at some stations. Chlorophyll a maxima shifted from the sea-ice surface horizon at the first station to the sea ice bottom layer at the last station. Highest DMSP concentrations were detected in brine samples at the sea-ice surface, reflecting a mismatch with respect to the distribution of chlorophyll a. Our data suggest enhanced DMSP production by sea-ice surface algal communities and its release into brine during freezing and melting, which in turn is coupled to flooding events early in the season. A time-cycle of DMS production by DMSP degradation and DMS efflux is evident at the sea ice-snow interface when slush is formed during melt. Seawater under the ice contained only low concentrations of DMSP and DMS, even when brine drainage was evident and the sea ice became permeable. We postulate that in situ grazing by zooplankton may act as sink for the DMSP produced early in the season. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Samples were collected and treated in the framework of the Italian National Program for Research in Antarctica. The entire analytical procedure is described, including sample digestion and handling, instrumental analysis and data evaluation. Due to the presence of molecular ions of the same nominal masses as the analyte nuclides, the instrument was used at high resolution settings (m/Delta m approximate to 3200) for most of the elements. Average concentrations (in mu g g(-1), dry weight) found in the samples and relative standard deviation (% in brackets) were: V 1.21 (2), Cr 0.51 (6), Mn 4.06 (4), Fe 56.2 (10), Co 0.068 (7), Ni 1.30 (4), Cu 70.6 (0.7), Zn 63 (5), Se 7.8 (6), Cd 0.71 (11), Sn 0.21 (14) and Pb 1.16 (7). For most of the elements the results obtained by ICP-SFMS are in good agreement with those measured with other techniques and used in the certification process.

ANTARCTIC SCIENCE												Wide-ranging, surface-feeding pelagic seabirds are the most numerous functional group of birds in the Southern Ocean. The mesoscale habitat use of these birds is increasingly being quantified by relating their movements to remotely sensed, near surface properties of the ocean. However, prey availability at the sea surface may also be determined by habitat characteristics not measurable from space. For instance, benthic-pelagic coupling, which occurs when seabed processes affect productivity in the epipelagic zone, can link benthic habitat type to availability of surface prey. We combined acoustically derived maps of the substrate of the South Georgia shelf with GPS tracking to quantify the sub-mesoscale habitat use of breeding black-browed albatrosses. We show that albatrosses preferentially used waters overlaying glacial moraine banks near the shelf edge and that this was unrelated to the presence of trawlers targeting mackerel icefish, which are also associated with these features. Stomach temperature profiles suggest that albatrosses primarily caught krill and fish over the banks. We hypothesize that black-browed albatrosses target waters overlaying moraine banks due to upward benthic-pelagic coupling, mediated by an increase in abundance of zooplankton such as Antarctic krill. Our findings suggest that the potential effects of such processes on pelagic seabird distribution warrant wider investigation.																	0954-1020	1365-2079				JUN	2012	24	3					269	280		10.1017/S0954102012000132							WOS:000304440700007

Despite studies dating from the beginning of the last century, the causes of the high productivity remain unclear. The island lies within the Antarctic Zone of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current, to the south of the Polar Front. The offshore waters to its north and east are affected by a northwards deflection of the Southern Antarctic Circumpolar Current Front, together with waters from the Weddell-Scotia Confluence, Despite a retentive circulation over the shelf, the high productivity of phytoplankton and copepods is widespread, occurring far downstream and possibly extending to the Polar Front. High phytoplankton concentrations (> 20 mg chlorophyll a m(-3)) may be linked to enhanced supply of iron or reduced forms of nitrogen (up to similar to3 mmol ammonium m(-3)). Although macronutrients are generally not limiting in the Antarctic Zone, silicate concentrations of < 1 mmol m(-3) are growth-limiting at South Georgia in some summers, The growth season is long and blooms of > 2 mg chl a m(-3) occur for 4 to 5 mo. Biomass of krill plus net-caught zooplankton in summer is around 15 to 20 g dry mass m(-2), equally dominated by krill and copepods. This greatly exceeds typical values for Antarctica, and is high compared to productive northern shelves, Zooplankton, and in particular krill, appear to have a pivotal role in regulating energy flow in this food web, through selective grazing and possibly also through nutrient regeneration. Abundances of krill and copepods are negatively related across a wide range of scales, suggesting direct interaction through competition or predation. Evidence suggests that when phytoplankton stocks are low, energy flow through krill is maintained by their feeding on the large populations of small copepods. Metazoans and higher predators at South Georgia can feed across several trophic levels according to prey abundance, and they regenerate substantial quantities of reduced nitrogen. Therefore we suggest that these groups have a controlling influence an lower trophic levels, both stabilising population sizes and maintaining high rates of energy flow. Hydrography, nutrient concentrations, phytoplankton, copepod, and krill biomasses fluctuate between years. Periodically (once or twice a decade), shortages of krill in summer result in breeding failures among many of their predators, This appears to be a downstream effect from wider scale, Scotia Sea phenomena, although the processes involved are unclear. The elevated biomass and energy flows at South Georgia appear to be caused by locally enhanced growth rates; there is no evidence so far for any physical concentration mechanism. Even for krill, which do not breed there, local growth rates are probably of a similar order to the biomass removed by their main land-based predators in summer. Thus the transfer of energy to higher predators depends on local enhancement of fluxes through the food web as well as the supply of plankton to the island by the Antarctic Circumpolar Current.

We have investigated the proximate composition, the amino acid, free fatty acid, mineral and protein composition, respectively, as well as the residual proteolytic activity of krill protein, as recovered by acidic- and alkaline-aided isoelectric solubilization/precipitation, in order to facilitate effective utilization of this krill species. Krill protein yield was 31.7 and 73.4 % by acidic and alkaline treatment, respectively. Both treatments resulted in a comparable higher content of essential amino acids than that in whole krill, accompanied with effective removal of insoluble materials. Three major proteolytic active bands with molecular weights of approximately 28, 18 and 16 kDa, as estimated by gelatin-based zymography, were detected. Pronounced residual proteolytic activity was observed in the krill protein after alkaline processing, implying the possible involvement of proteinase(s) in protein degradation during alkaline solubilization. Based on these results, we suggest that inhibition of proteolysis during isoelectric solubilization/precipitation is required for the effective use of North Pacific krill.

From sea ice to blubber: linking whale condition to krill abundance using historical whaling records	POLAR BIOLOGY												Krill (Euphausia superba) are fundamentally important in the Southern Ocean ecosystem, forming a critical food web link between primary producers and top predators. Krill abundance fluctuates with oceanographic conditions, most notably variation in winter sea ice, and is susceptible to environmental change. Although links between local krill availability and performance of land breeding, central place foragers are recognised, the effects of krill variability on baleen whales remain largely unclear because concurrent long-term data on whale condition and krill abundance do not exist. Here, we quantify links between whale body condition and krill abundance using a simple model that links krill abundance to sea ice extent. Body condition of humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) caught in west Australian waters between 1947 and 1963 was estimated from oil yields in whaling records. Annual estimates of krill abundance in the Southern Ocean where those whales foraged (70A degrees-130A degrees E) were correlated significantly with contemporary annual winter sea ice extent. We hindcast sea ice extent for the whaling period from reconstructed temperature data and found that whale body condition was significantly correlated with hindcasted winter sea ice extent, supporting the hypothesis that variations in body condition were likely mediated by associated krill fluctuations. As humpback whales migrate and breed on finite energy stores accrued during summer foraging in the Antarctic, changes in sea ice and concomitant changes in krill abundance have long-term implications for their condition and reproductive success.
