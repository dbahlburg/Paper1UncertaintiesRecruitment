This fact has led to the development of sustainable and functional diets as part of a management strategy to reduce the effects on fish growth performance and health derived from low FM/FO dietary contents. In this sense, Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) is considered a potential candidate in dietary inclusions to potentiate fish growth and health status. In this study, European sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax) were fed a practical diet with either a 15% fishmeal content (KM0; control diet) or the same diet substituted by 30% (KM5; 5 g KM/kg diet) or 50% (KM7.5; 7.5 g KM/kg diet) Antarctic krill meal (KM) for 12 weeks in triplicates. At the end of the feeding trial, growth performance, liver morphology, liver proximate composition, lipid classes and fatty acid profiles, as well as the expression of hepatic genes related with lipid metabolism were evaluated. Fish fed KM-based diets presented higher (p < 0.05) final weight, protein and lipid efficiency ratios, specific growth rate (SGR) and improved feed conversion ratio (FCR), irrespective of the KM dietary level. Whole body and muscle proximate composition and fatty acid profiles were similar among dietary groups. Livers of European sea bass fed the experimental diets presented similar (p > 0.05) biochemical composition and fatty acid profile. However, smaller hepatocellular area and lower grade of cytoplasm vacuolization as well as a better alignment around sinusoidal spaces were found. The analyses of liver lipid classes revealed a positive correlation between the level of dietary KM and the pigmented material such as astaxanthin and free fatty acid content, as well as a negative correlation with the cholesterol levels. The expression of hepatic genes studied demonstrated a downregulation of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase (hmgr) and delta-6-desaturase (fads2) expression levels in fish fed KM-based diets. Besides, gene expression levels of fatty acid binding protein 7 (fabp7) and lipoprotein lipase (lpl) were significantly correlated with KM dietary levels. Altogether, these results profile KM as a potential promoter of growth and liver health in European sea bass fed low fish meal and oil diets. © 2021 The Authors",2-s2.0-85110118294

No significant differences were found in body length, body weight, and specific growth rate compared with the control group, but the KM4.125 and KM8.250 groups had significantly increased condition factors and hepatosomatic indices. The KM8.250 fish showed a significant increase in redness values in the dorsal skin, while the KM12.375 fish presented significantly higher yellowness in the ventral skin and tail fin. Addition of krill meal exerted no significant effect on whole-body proximate composition. The KM8.250 group showed significantly higher lipid content and lower ash content, which differed from those of the KM12.375 group. Most of the amino acids in muscle and liver tissues remained unchanged compared to those in the control. The KM4.125 group showed significantly higher muscle proline, serine, and total functional amino acids, while the total amino acid content in KM12.375 fish significantly decreased.

At present, the research about Antarctic krill phospholipid (KOPL) mainly focuses on the purification, and there are few reports on the anti-obesity effect. Thus, this study aimed at evaluating the effect of KOPL on the high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity mice. All the mice were divided into five groups, which were fed chow diet, HFD, and different doses of KOPL + HFD, respectively. The results showed that KOPL treatment could reduce the weight gain, fat accumulation, and liver tissue damage in HFD-induced mice. KOPL treatment could reduce the levels of serum lipid (TC, TG, L-LDL) and fasting blood glucose in HFD-induced mice, and the inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β and TNF-α) in serum. Further analysis showed that KOPL could promote the normal expression of lipid-synthesis-related genes and proteins, including sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c), fatty acid synthetase (FAS), and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPAR-α) in liver tissue. Besides, it inhibited the overexpression of inflammatory cytokine genes (IL-1β and TNF-α), but increased the expression of tight junction genes (ZO-1 and Occludin) in the colon tissue. Additionally, KOPL improved the decrease of diversity and imbalance of intestinal microbiota, which could contribute to its beneficial effects. In summary, the KOPL treatment improves the effects of HFD-induced obese mice by maintaining normal lipid levels, protecting the liver tissue, reducing inflammation response and intestinal damage, and regulating intestinal microbiota abnormalities. It refer to KOPL could be a promising dietary strategy for treating obesity and improving its related metabolic diseases. © 2021",2-s2.0-85110260715

We show that the product of ice concentration and irradiance penetrating into sea ice (Eice) explains 69% of the variability in ice algal production at the sector and seasonal scale estimated from two respected sea ice algae models. After allowing for a greater quantum yield of sea ice algae in summer than in other seasons we estimated a simple light-based index of potential ice algal production (Pice) and this explained 91% of the variability in modelled ice algal production.

It is a known source of highly bioavailable omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid). In preclinical studies, krill oil showed metabolic, anti-inflammatory, neuroprotective and chemo preventive effects, while in clinical trials it showed significant metabolic, vascular and ergogenic actions. Solvent extraction is the most conventional method to obtain krill oil. However, different solvents must be used to extract all lipids from krill because of the diversity of the polarities of the lipid compounds in the biomass. This review aims to provide an overview of the chemical composition, bioavailability and bioaccessibility of krill oil, as well as the mechanisms of action, classic and non-conventional extraction techniques, health benefits and current applications of this marine crustacean. © 2021 by the authors.

However, the degree of unsaturation of long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids, especially those from the omega 3 family, makes dry samples of the species vulnerable to oxidative degradation during long-term storage. The ontogenetic and temporal variation in fatty acids of dry krill tissues preserved under ambient temperature is unclear. To investigate the effects of long-term storage at ambient temperatures on degradation of fatty acids in krill, variation in the fatty acid composition of dried tissues at 0, 4, and 8 months was investigated. The results showed that storage time had a significant effect on fatty acid composition. When preserved for up to 4 months, the fatty acid content of krill changed dramatically, after which the proportion of fatty acids stabilized. Sensitivity to oxidation varied with the type of fatty acid, and krill size had an effect on the antioxidant capacity of fatty acids. Novelty impact statement: The ontogenetic and temporal variation in fatty acids of dry Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) tissues preserved under ambient temperature was investigated. Storage time had a significant effect on fatty acid composition for long-term storage of dried krill tissue preserved at a constant temperature. Krill size affected the degree of fatty acid oxidation and larger individuals lost more polyunsaturated fatty acids in the long term (8 months). Four months is a valuable reference for studying the effects of storage time on fatty acid degradation of krill tissue to maximize its nutritional value. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.",2-s2.0-85101553403

However, alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) from flaxseed oil, which is a short-chain n-3 PUFA, is often promoted in pet feed as a n-3 source, implicitly assuming it is an effective precursor of EPA and DHA. Objective: This study was aimed to compare the effect of supplementation with a plant-based short-chain n-3 PUFA source (flaxseed oil, FSO) with a marine long-chain n-3 PUFA source (astaxanthin krill oil, AKO) to increase the Omega-3 Index in dogs. Methods: Ten adult Alaskan Huskies of both genders were supplemented daily with 1,155 mg of EPA/DHA from AKO, whereas another 10 dogs received 1,068 mg ALA from flaxseed oil for 6 weeks. Fatty acid and Omega-3 Index measurements of the two groups were taken after 0, 3 and 6 weeks for comparison. Results: The EPA and DHA concentrations increased significantly only in the dogs fed with AKO resulting in a significant increase in mean Omega-3 Index, from 1.68% at baseline to 2.7% after 6 weeks of supplementation (p <.0001). On the contrary, both EPA and DHA concentrations decreased significantly in the dogs fed with FSO, which led to a significant decrease in mean Omega-3 Index from 1.6% at baseline to 0.96% at study end (p <.0001). Conclusions: The results showed that supplementation of AKO from Antarctic krill led to a significant increase in the Omega-3 Index in comparison to FSO in dogs. This suggests that preformed marine EPA and DHA sources are needed in dog feeds, as the dietary requirements proposed by feed industry organizations are not met with conversion from short-chain n-3 fatty acids. © 2020 The Authors.

A better understanding of OA pathogenesis is thus important. The peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) plays a major regulatory role in lipid metabolism and energy homeo- stasis. This review article aimed to discuss the biological function of PPARs, and their role in regulating OA progres- sion, as well as the therapeutic aspect of PPARs in OA. Studies indicate that PPARs regulate articular cartilage homeostasis through the modulation of various signaling pathways, and reduce the inflammatory responses in human OA cartilage. Furthermore, the deficiency of PPARs in the articular carti- lage might be responsible for the acceleration of severe OA by increasing catabolic activity and suppression of chondro- protection. Therapeutic applications of PPAR-agonists can thus reduce the development of cartilage lesions by inhibiting the synthesis of various catabolic and inflammatory factors involved in the pathogenesis of OA. PPARs are thus important proteins in OA regulation, which may have significant impor- tance in OA therapeutics. © 2021 Spandidos Publications. All rights reserved.",2-s2.0-85098529554

We apply the Bayesian tool MixSIAR to both SI and FA data to estimate the diet of three sympatric predators: the crabeater (Lobodon carcinophaga), Weddell (Leptonychotes weddellii) and leopard seal (Hydrurga leptonyx). We used SI data of their vibrissae and FA data of their outer blubber to produce comparable diet estimates for the same individuals. Both SI and FA models predicted the same main diet components, although the predicted proportions differed. For the crabeater seal, both methods identified krill, Euphausia superba, as the main, and almost exclusive, food item, although the FA model estimated a slightly lower proportion, potentially due to the low lipid content of krill compared to the fish species used in the model. For the Weddell seal the FA model identified the fish Pleuragramma antarcticum as the most important prey, whereas the SI model was not able to distinguish among prey species, identifying a ‘fish-squid’ group as the main diet component. For the leopard seal, both models identified krill as the main contributor; however, the predicted proportions for the secondary sources differed. Although vibrissae and outer blubber may not represent the same timeframe, the use of MixSIAR with FA data provides diet estimates comparable to those obtained with SI data, thus, both approaches were complimentary.

However, the transition from fresh/frozen to extruded/pelleted feeds remains a major obstacle to progressing sustainable farming of European lobster (Homarus gammarus). The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of using extruded feeds with different protein levels and lipid/carbohydrate ratios on growth, feed utilisation, nucleic acid derived indices (sRD) and digestive enzymatic activity of H. gammarus juveniles. Six extruded feeds were formulated to contain two protein levels (400 and 500 g/kg), with three lipid/carbohydrate ratios (LOW - 1:3; MEDium - 1:2; HIGH - 1:1). The extruded feeds were tested against Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) used as control (CTRL). Overall, the CTRL and 500MED feed supported the highest growth and nutritional condition estimated by means of sRD, while the poorest results were observed for the 400HIGH and 400MED groups. The FCR was significantly lower in the CTRL than all extruded feeds, among which the most efficient, i.e., lower FCR, was the 500MED. The highest activity of trypsin and amylase in lobsters fed the 400MED and 400HIGH feeds points to the activation of a mechanism to maximise nutrients assimilation. The highest lipase activity observed for the 500LOW and 500MED groups indicates a higher capacity to metabolise and store lipids. Overall, the results suggest that the 500MED feed (500 g/kg protein, 237 g/kg carbohydrates and 119 g/kg lipids) is a suitable extruded feed candidate to replace Antarctic krill, commonly used to grow lobster juveniles.

Peroxide value (POV) and malondialdehyde (MDA) content showed that Fe3+ exhibited the most effective prooxidative activity, with the prooxidative activity of Fe2(SO4)3 (water-soluble) being stronger than that of ferric oleate (FeOl, fat-soluble). In addition, phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) oxidation degree (more than 90%) was considerably greater than phosphatidylcholine (PC) oxidation degree (about 15%) in AKO. Differences in the structure of head group hindered chelation of PC with metal ions than PE due to electrostatic repulsion and steric hindrance.

In this study, a feasible quality evaluation system was established to assess the Antarctic krill meal using the principal component analysis. 15 quality indicators of an Antarctic krill meal were classified, including the moisture, protein, lipid, ash, salt, phospholipid, astaxanthin, tocopherol, acid value, histamine, TVB-N, pyrrole, fluorine, lysine, and methionine. A SPSS 24.0 software was used to carry out the probability distribution, analytical hierarchy process, K-means cluster, and discriminant analysis. A factor analysis was performed to select the primary quality indicators from 15 quality indices of an Antarctic krill meal. The probability distribution and analytical hierarchy process were used to grade and determine the weights of the quality indicators. The K-means cluster and discriminant analysis were employed to establish the discriminant model of a quality evaluation for the Antarctic krill meal. The results demonstrated that the quality indicators of an Antarctic krill meal were dispersed with the coefficient of variation from 8.89% to 84.46%. Six quality indicators of an Antarctic krill meal (protein, lipid, salt, lysine, tocopherol, and TVB-N) were in the highly significant correlation with the quality of Antarctic krill meal, further to serve as the indicators of quality evaluation for the Antarctic krill meal. Five grades were divided in the six quality indicators, including the lower, low, medium, high, and higher level, indicating normal or near normal distributions. The principal component analysis showed that the cumulative variance contribution rate of six principal components were 92.263%. The importance of 6 principal components and the comprehensive evaluation model were selected to establish the quality grading standards and scoring system for the Antarctic krill meal. The results showed that a highly accurate quality evaluation was achieved in the various Antarctic krill meal, whether the modeling samples or experimental ones. Therefore, the scores from the prediction model can be utilized to fully distinguish the quality indicators, such as protein, lipid, salt, lysine, tocopherol, and TVB-N in the tested samples. Combining the grade and score of quality indicators, it was found that the quality of an Antarctic krill meal was a comprehensive effects of different components in the Antarctic krill meal. The prediction model can also be used to accurately distinguish and evaluate the difference in the quality of Antarctic krill meal. This finding can provide a basic information support to establish the evaluation system, further to realize the comprehensive detection in the quality of Antarctic krill meal. The facile evaluation can also be extended to the scientific quality evaluation of fish meal. © 2020, Editorial Department of the Transactions of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

Evidence of heterogeneous feeding patterns of east coast of Australia migrating humpback whales has been observed, warranting a comprehensive assessment of interannual variability in their diet. We examined the lipid and fatty acid profiles of individuals of the east coast of Australia migrating stock sampled between 2008 and 2018. The use of live-sampled blubber biopsies showed that fatty acid profiles varied significantly among all years. The two trophic indicator fatty acids for Antarctic krill, 20:5ω3 and 22:6ω3 remained largely unchanged across the 10-year period, suggesting that Antarctic krill is the principal prey item. A distance-based linear model showed that 33% of the total variation in fatty acid profiles was explained by environmental variables and climate indices. Most of the variation was explained by the Southern Annular Mode (23.7%). The high degree of variability observed in this study was unexpected for a species that is thought to feed primarily on one prey item. We propose that the observed variability likely arises from changes in the diet of Antarctic krill rather than changes in the whale’s diet. © 2020, The Author(s).",2-s2.0-85094190916

E. superba displays sexual dimorphism during growth. A group of mature males, called Males II herein, has a greater abdominal length, suggesting that they are faster swimmers, a feature implying higher metabolic rates and a higher demand for protecting pigments like carotenoids. Mature Males II have proportionally lower lipids but higher total lipid-soluble carotenoids, a counterintuitive finding. Males II also have bigger eyes. Significant regressions with carotenoids were found for wet weight, abdominal length, and eye diameter. On a spatial analysis, population composition reflects reproductive activity. Males II would be in search of females for fecundation and, thus, are dominant in some areas. The PCA analysis of 10 allometric and biochemical variables show a distinct Males II group differing in morphology, carotenoids, and lipid contents. The carotenoid:lipid ratio was highest for Males II, supporting the hypothesis of the role of carotenoids in the activity of the species. Mature males may experience physiological stress during reproduction and probably die shortly afterwards. A relationship between activity, morphometrics, and carotenoid content seems evident, deserving further investigation. © 2020, The Author(s).",2-s2.0-85089136902

Krill lipids are primarily derived from their diet of plankton, in particular diatoms and flagellates. Few attempts have been made to link the spatial and temporal variations in krill lipids to those in their food supply. Remotely-sensed environmental parameters provide large-scale information on the potential availability of krill food, although relating this to physiological and biochemical differences has only been performed on small scales and with limited samples. Our study utilised remotely-sensed data (chlorophyll a and sea surface temperature) coupled with krill lipid data obtained from 3 years of fishery-derived samples. We examined within and between year variation of trends in both the environment and krill biochemistry data. Chlorophyll a levels were positively related to krill lipid levels, particularly triacylglycerol. Plankton fatty acid biomarkers analysed in krill (such as n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids) increased with decreasing sea surface temperature and increasing chlorophyll a levels.

Proteins exhibit immense effect on lipid oxidation and induce protein–lipid co-oxidation. This study aimed at elucidating the co-oxidation mechanism of AKO and whey protein (WP) or myofibrillar protein (MP) in oil-in-water emulsions. The estimations of malondialdehyde (MDA) content, phospholipid molecular species, and pyrrole content resulted in increased and decreased oxidation rate of AKO (especially phosphatidylethanolamine) by WP and MP, respectively. Meanwhile, protein concentration, sulfhydryl content, the loss of tryptophan fluorescence intensity, and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis results demonstrated that AKO promoted WP oxidation but inhibited MP oxidation. Further, the antioxidative abilities of seven common antioxidants were evaluated. Ascorbyl palmitate showed the most substantial antioxidative effect for both AKO and proteins (about 70% decrease of MDA content and 30% decrease of the decrease ratio of tryptophan fluorescence intensity). This finding supported that different proteins could exhibit different pro/anti-oxidative effects on lipid oxidation, especially for marine lipids abundant in phospholipids and polyunsaturated fatty acids. Besides, MP could also act as antioxidant in MP AKO emulsions, further extending its application from traditional surfactants. Practical Application: AKO is usually encapsulated by the protein materials, enhancing its oxidative stability. The results demonstrated MP could inhibit AKO oxidation, and vice versa, especially when ascorbyl palmitate was added at the same time. As a result, this finding explored a new potential wall material with antioxidative ability for the encapsulated products of AKO. © 2020 Institute of Food Technologists®",2-s2.0-85092591754

With the aim of determining appropriate nutrient levels, we tested different formulated extruded feeds for the culture of juvenile European lobster. Baseline metabolism (standard metabolic rate, SMR), in combination with the metabolic cost of feeding (specific dynamic action, SDA), and nitrogen retention during digestion and assimilation was investigated for six experimental diets. Diets were formulated to contain two different levels of protein (400 and 500 g kg−1), with three lipid to carbohydrate (L:CHO) ratios (low, medium, and high). These experimental diets were tested over a 32-day period, against a conventional control diet (Antarctic krill, Euphausia superba). During this period, the growth performance of the juveniles was assessed as molting frequency, increments in carapace length and whole body wet weight. At the end of the growth performance trial, oxygen consumption (MO2) and nitrogen excretion rates of individual lobsters were determined prior to and following the ingestion of a single meal. Molting occurred more frequently in juveniles fed with krill and krill resulted in a significantly higher specific growth rate than experimental dry feeds except for the 500-low diet. However, lobsters fed any of the three 500 and the 400-low diets had carapace length increments, SMR, SDA, and nitrogen retention similar to those fed the krill diet. Results suggest that protein is an important macronutrient for juveniles of this species and must be included above 40%. Also, lobsters have a dietary requirement for carbohydrates ranging from 24% to 35% probably related to the need for glycogen in chitin synthesis.

However, its application as a dietary supplement is limited, because of its rapid deterioration. Thus, this study aims to investigate the oxidative stability of krill oil extracted from Euphausia superba. Under optimal conditions (enzyme concentration 0.16%, enzymolysis time 2.9 h, and enzymolysis temperature of 45 ◦C) designed by response surface methodology, the extraction yield of krill oil is 86.02%. Five assays, including peroxide value (POV), thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS), pH value, and turbidity were used to determine the oxidative stability of krill oil nanoliposomes during storage. Carboxymethyl chitosan (CMCS) nanoliposomes showed a significant reduction in POV and TBARS values, a prevention of pH value decrease and turbidity increase. This study indicated that CMCS nanoliposome can effectively improve the oxidative stability of krill oil during storage. Furthermore, the release profile in vitro illustrated that the controlled release of krill oil carried out by CMCS nanoliposomes is feasible. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

Final body weight (3·9 (se 0·04) kg) was similar in the dietary groups, but the KM group had more voluminous body shape, leaner hearts and improved fillet integrity, firmness and colour. Ectopic epithelial cells and focal Ca deposits in intestine were only detected in the FM group. Transcriptome profiling by microarray of livers showed dietary effects on several immune genes, and a panel of structural genes were up-regulated in the KM group, including cadherin and connexin. Up-regulation of genes encoding myosin heavy chain proteins was the main finding in skeletal muscle. Morphology examination by scanning electron microscopy and secondary structure by Fourier transform IR spectroscopy revealed more ordered and stable collagen architecture of the KM group. NEFA composition of skeletal muscle indicated altered metabolism of n-3, n-6 and SFA of the KM group. The results demonstrated that improved health and meat quality in Atlantic salmon fed krill meal were associated with up-regulation of immune genes, proteins defining muscle properties and genes involved in cell contacts and adhesion, altered fatty acid metabolism and fat deposition, and improved gut health and collagen structure. © 2020 The Authors.",2-s2.0-85083284694

Ocean acidification, caused by sequestration of carbon dioxide into ocean surface waters (pCO2), alters the lipid biochemistry of some organisms. This can have cascading effects up the food chain. In a year-long laboratory experiment adult krill were exposed to ambient seawater pCO2 levels (400 μatm), elevated pCO2 levels mimicking near-future ocean acidification (1000, 1500 and 2000 μatm) and an extreme pCO2 level (4000 μatm). Total lipid mass (mg g−1 DM) of krill was unaffected by near-future pCO2. Fatty acid composition (%) and fatty acid ratios associated with immune responses and cell membrane fluidity were also unaffected by near-future pCO2, apart from an increase in 18:3n-3/18:2n-6 ratios in krill in 1500 μatm pCO2 in winter and spring.

However, questions have been raised about using fatty acids as dietary indicators from whole lipid samples, rather than from separate lipid classes. A drawback of scientific field-based studies is that samples are rarely collected over extended periods, precluding seasonal dietary comparisons. We used fisheries samples obtained over one year to investigate seasonal variations in the fatty acid composition of separated phospholipids and triacylglycerols of Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba). Seasonal variation was observed in fatty acid biomarkers within triacylglycerol and phospholipid fractions of krill. Fatty acids in krill triacylglycerols (thought to best represent recent diet), reflected omnivorous feeding with highest percentages of flagellate biomarkers (18:4n-3) in summer, and diatom biomarkers (16:1n-7c) in autumn, winter and spring. Carnivory biomarkers (∑ 20:1 + 22:1 and 18:1n-9c/18:1n-7c) in krill were higher in autumn. Phospholipid fatty acids were less variable and higher in 20:5n-3 and 22:6n-3, which are essential components of cell membranes. Sterol composition did not yield detailed dietary information, but percentages and quantities of cholesterol, the major krill sterol, were significantly higher in winter and spring compared with summer and autumn. Copepod markers ∑ 20:1 + 22:1 were not strongly associated with the triacylglycerol fraction during some seasons, and neither was 18:4n-3. Krill might mobilise 18:4n-3 from triacylglycerols to phospholipids for conversion to long-chain (≥ C20) polyunsaturated fatty acids, which would have implications for its role as a dietary biomarker. For the first time, we demonstrate the dynamic seasonal relationship between specific biomarkers and krill lipid classes. © 2019, Crown.",2-s2.0-85073534144

These islands experience a range of conditions in terms of physical and biological habitat, creating a natural laboratory to investigate local genetic adaptation. One striking habitat difference is in the availability of Euphausia superba krill as prey, which has led to A. gazella exhibiting a range of diets. A. gazella in some colonies consume exclusively krill, while their conspecifics in other colonies feed mainly on fish and consume few to no krill. To investigate potential adaptations to these different prey fields, reduced representation genome sequencing was conducted on A. gazella from the 8 major colonies. Twenty-seven genomic regions exhibiting signatures of natural selection were identified. Two of these genomic regions were clearly associated with seals living in krill-dominated areas or those in fish-dominated areas. Twenty-two additional genomic regions under selection showed a pattern consistent with prey differences as the driver of selection after historical migrations from krill-dominated habitats where lineages evolved to present krill-poor habitat areas were taken into account. Only 1 of the genomic regions identified appeared to be explained by any other environmental variable analysed (depth). Genomic regions under prey-driven selection included genes associated with regulation of gene expression, skeletal development, and lipid metabolism. Adaptation to local prey has implications for spatial management of this species and for the potential impacts of climate- or harvest-driven reductions in krill abundance on these seals. © Inter-Research and The Crown 2019",2-s2.0-85073811603

However, its application as a novel food ingredient has not yet been fully explored. This review summarizes the chemical composition, extraction technologies, potential health benefits, and current applications of krill oil, with the aim of providing suggestions for its exploitation. Krill oil is a unique lipid consisting of diverse lipid classes and is characterized by a high concentration (39.29% to 80.69%) of phospholipids (PLs) associated with eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). It also contains considerable amounts of bioactive minor components such as astaxanthin, sterols, tocopherols, vitamin A, flavonoids, and minerals. The current technologies used in krill oil production are solvent extraction, nonsolvent extraction, super/subcritical fluid extraction, and enzyme-assisted pretreatment extraction, which all greatly influence the yield and quality of the end-product. In addition, krill oil has been documented to have various health benefits, including anti-inflammatory effects, cardiovascular disease (CVD) prevention, women's health, neuroprotection, and anticancer activities. Although krill oil products used for dietary supplements have been commercially available, few studies have attempted to explore the underlying molecular mechanisms to elucidate how exactly the krill oil exerts different biological activities. Further studies should focus on this to improve the development of krill oil products for human consumption. © 2019 Institute of Food Technologists®",2-s2.0-85061435395

RESULT: Liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry of the phospholipids and the main oxidation products of free fatty acids and phosphatidylcholine (PC) was effective for evaluating the oxidation of EPA and DHA. During boiling, oxidation of EPA and DHA in the free fatty acid and PC fractions and hydrolysis of the fatty acids at the sn-2 position of the phospholipids were predominant. The changes in PC during drying were mainly attributed to the oxidation of EPA and DHA. Heat treatment increased the oxidation products and concentration of hydrophobic pyrrole owing to pyrrolization between phosphatidylethanolamine and the lipid oxidation products. CONCLUSION: The lipid oxidation level of Antarctic krill increased after drying, owing to prolonged heating under the severe conditions. © 2018 Society of Chemical Industry. © 2018 Society of Chemical Industry",2-s2.0-85054040932

Feeding on seasonally productive prey species, followed by extended fasting associated with energy intensive activities, such as migration, competitive breeding behavior, pregnancy, and lactation, results in massive fluctuations in lipid reserves. These fluctuations are mirrored in the toxicokinetics of lipophilic contaminant burdens, with significant mobilization and redistribution of contaminants taking place between the individual's tissues during this time. While the toxicologic consequence of this life-history behavior remains unquantified, fasting should be thought of as a time of ""reexposure"" of target sites of toxicity to harmful chemicals. Of significant relevance is the temporal cooccurrence of pregnancy and nursing of young calves, with elevated circulating maternal chemical burdens. Elevated maternal offloading of persistent organic pollutants to the young is further exacerbated by the disproportionate exposure experienced by the embryo and calf on account of a smaller body size. The interplay of multiple stressors, for example, chemical exposure, negative energy balance, and immune function, during migration remains a critical nexus of priority for future investigation. The importance of such investigations are underscored by the vulnerability of the Antarctic sea-ice ecosystem to the direct effects of polar climate change, which may result in further energetic challenges to Southern Ocean mysticetes, already adapted to metabolic extremes. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

In this study, Antarctic krill lipid extraction conditions using subcritical n-butane were investigated and optimized by response surface methodology. The optimal extraction conditions using subcritical n-butane were, 120 min dynamic extractions at 40 °C and 1.0 MPa. Lipids extracted by the subcritical n-butane were further compared with those extracted by supercritical CO2 and traditional solvents. Results indicated that the lipid extraction by using subcritical n-butane had a higher lipid recovery rate (81.2 ± 1.5%), higher astaxanthin content (248.4 ± 5.2 mg/kg) and the highest tocopherol content (67.7 ± 3.2 mg/kg). Furthermore, the lipids’ volatile components and flavor components were further investigated. Results revealed that the lipid extracted by subcritical n-butane had lower 1-Penten-3-ol and aldehydes content, indicating less lipid oxidation and higher sulfur-containing compounds which might contribute to the overall aroma of Antarctic krill lipid. Additionally, Antarctic krill lipid extracted by subcritical n-butane had a higher lipid recovery rate and better nutritional quality. Thus, subcritical n-butane could be the best solvent for efficiently extract Antarctic krill lipid. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",2-s2.0-85045428870

A control diet (R0) without AKM and the other five diets with 8.1, 16.2, 24.3, 32.4, and 42.5% AKM supplementation (R10–50) to replace 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50% fishmeal protein were used to feed to juvenile spotted halibut. The juveniles were fed with each diet using three replicates and cultivated in the indoor culture system. Results showed that the specific growth rate, feed intake, and protein efficiency ratio in the R30 and R40 groups were significantly higher than that in other groups (P < 0.05). Survival rate in the R50 group was significantly lower compared with the R0 group and the other four AKM supplementation groups. Moreover, the rising AKM levels in diets had significant effects on the chemical composition of juvenile spotted halibut, showing significantly decreased contents of crude protein, but increased lipid and ash contents (P < 0.05). The total superoxide dismutase activity and catalase activity of serum and liver in AKM groups were significantly higher than those in the control group (P < 0.05). In contrast, the contents of malondialdehyde in serum and liver were significantly lower compared with the control group. These findings illustrate that a moderate AKM level in diets can significantly improve the growth performance, feed utilization, and antioxidative capacity in juvenile spotted halibut, which support the finding that AKM may be used as a good protein source for halibut in the aquafeed industry. © Copyright by the World Aquaculture Society 2017",2-s2.0-85028944580

The mechanism of Krill oil function is not clear yet and research reports on the absorption rate of the phospholipids of krill oil in the blood and brain are very poor. Methods: We studied the effect of oral short-term and long-term administration of Krill oils (KOs) on bioavailability in the blood and brain of rats. For short-term testing of fish and KO bioavailability, rats were divided into four groups: normal, fish oil (FO), Krill oil 1 (KO), and Krill oil 2 (CKO). The blood and brain were collected at 2, 4, 8, 12, 24, and 48 h after oral administration (1000 mg/rat). Five hundred milligrams of FO, KO, and CKO were orally administered daily for 2 weeks for long-term administration, and then the brain and blood were collected. Results: Two types of KOs showed high content of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) in the PL. The EPA content of CKO and KO were 41.13 and 32.49%, respectively. After short-term KO administration, KO showed a higher EPA content than CKO in the blood after 2 h. KO showed higher content of DHA than CKO even after 2 h. FO increased until 8 h, but then decreased rapidly until 12 h. Although the total unsaturated fatty acid (UFA) content of KOs was lower than the total UFS content in FO, the remaining UFS content in the brain was higher than that in FO over time. Following oral administration of FO, KO, and CKO for 1 and 2 weeks, triglycerides (TG) and PL contents in the blood for KOs were slightly higher than for FO. EPA and DHA levels in the brain were slightly higher in KOs following long-term administration, but the difference was not significant. Conclusions: Base on these findings, KOs have functional potential for the brain and vascular diseases, and can be utilized as a multi-functional material composed mainly of functional ingredients. © 2018 The Author(s).",2-s2.0-85050361173

Triacylglycerols (TAGs) are an important source of free fatty acids (FFAs) in Antarctic krill paste, causing an increase in FFA content in the early stage of processing, while phospholipids are intensely hydrolyzed during the mid-late stages. Lipase activities remains constant, while PLA2 and PLD activities increases during all stages of processing. The relative activities of PLA2 and PLC highly correlates with a decline in phosphatidylcholine (PC) and an increase in lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC). A high correlation is also observed between relative PLD activity and increased phosphatidic acid (PA). These results suggest that lipase, PLA2, and PLD contribute to the degradation of lipids during the processing of salt-fermented Antarctic krill paste. Practical Applications: Due to their abundance of Antarctic krill, fermentation technology can be applied to transform them into a popular condiment. The present study aimes to investigate changes in lipid composition throughout krill salt-fermentation, and to evaluate their potential effects on fermented krill product. Knowledge of lipase activities during processing is essential to improve the quality of the end products and to further elucidate the complicated mechanisms of lipid degradation. The study of lipid degradation during processing and storage of krill products is of great concern in order to obtain products of high quality and health. Lipid degradation during the processing of salt-fermented Antarctic krill paste is studied by evaluating changes in physicochemical parameters, lipid content, and fatty acid composition, phospholipase and lipase activities and the study provides information that Lipase, PLA2, and PLD contribute to the degradation of lipids during the processing of salt-fermented Antarctic krill paste. © 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Knowledge of the lipid biochemistry of krill assists in understanding their seasonal biology and predicting their responses to ecological changes. We collected daily samples of krill from a commercial fishing vessel operating in the Atlantic Sector of the Southern Ocean from 2014 to 2016. We analysed the total lipid content of krill sampled every two weeks and the relative distribution of lipid class levels to examine seasonal trends. Krill total lipid content varied significantly within and between seasons and sexes. An annual sinusoidal trend was seen in total lipid content with the highest values in autumn and the lowest in spring (average 380 and 87 mg/g dry mass, respectively). Total lipids in krill increased during summer, peaking in autumn, with the total lipids in winter individuals decreasing towards spring. The relative distribution of lipid class levels varied between season and year. Levels of triacylglycerol showed the same seasonal trend as total lipid content, whilst phospholipid showed the inverse trend indicating the contrasting roles of these two dominant lipid classes.

To understand the flexibility of Antarctic krill’s seasonal cycle, we investigated its physiological and behavioural responses to different light regimes and if an endogenous timing system was involved in the regulation of these seasonal processes. We analysed growth, feeding, lipid content, and maturity in a 2-year laboratory experiment simulating the latitudinal light regimes at 52°S and 66°S and constant darkness under constant food level. Our results showed that light regime affected seasonal cycles of growth, feeding, lipid metabolism, and maturity in Antarctic krill. Seasonal patterns of growth, feeding, and maturity persisted under constant darkness, indicating the presence of an endogenous timing system. The maturity cycle showed differences in critical photoperiods according to the simulated latitudinal light regime. This suggests a flexible endogenous timing mechanism in Antarctic krill, which may determine its response to future environmental changes. © 2018, Canadian Science Publishing.

The effect on its dehydration efficiency, and effects on lipid extraction rate and lipid qualities and cost of the process were compared. The Antarctic krill was first treated by HPD, followed by the FD method. The lipids extracted from the various dehydrated samples were compared. In addition, the time and energy consumption during the process of dehydration and the physical properties such as color and microstructure of the Antarctic krill samples dehydrated by various drying methods were also compared. The results indicated that Antarctic krill drying by combined dehydration had good color and microstructure, which were both close to the FD sample, and better than the heat pump and hot air drying samples alone. The procedure was performed with an optimal dehydration temperature of HPD at 60 °C and a transition point of 40% moisture content, followed by freezing-drying up to moisture content of 10%. Lipids extracted from Antarctic krill dried through procedure would have high lipid extraction rate (21.02%), low acid value (10.4 mg KOH/g), high astaxanthin content (200 mg/kg). Importantly it would save about 62 and 50%, respectively, of time and energy consumption in comparison of freezing-drying method.

Diets with healthy nutrition are efficient means to prevent this epidemic occurrence. Novel food resources and process technology were needed for these purpose. In this study, Antarctic krill oil (KO) extracted from a dry krill by a procedure of hot pump dehydration in combined with freezing-drying was used to investigate health effect in animals including the growth, lipid and glucose metabolism. Methods: C57BL/6J mice were fed with a lard based high fat (HF) diet and substituted with KO for a period of 12 weeks in comparison with low fat normal control (NC) diet. Mice body weight and food consumption were recorded. Serum lipid metabolism - of C57BL/6J mice serum was measured. A glucose tolerance tests (GTTs) and pathology analysis of mice were performed at the end of the experiment. Results: The KO fed mice had less body weight gain, less fat accumulation in tissue such as adipose and liver. Dyslipidemia induced by high fat diet was partially improved by KO feeding with significant reduction of serum low density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) content. Furthermore, KO feeding also improved glucose metabolism in C57BL/6J mice including a glucose tolerance of about 22% vs. 32% of AUC (area under the curve) for KO vs HF diet and the fast blood glucose level of 8.5 mmol/L, 9.8 mmol/L and 9.3 mmol/L for NC, HF and KO diet groups, respectively. In addition, KO feeding also reduced oxidative damage in liver with a decrease of malondialdehyde (MDA) content and increase of superoxide dismutase (SOD) content.

Gel electrophoresis analysis indicated that some variations in protein composition were introduced by autolysis and pH shift during the process of isoelectric precipitation and fluoride removal. The FKPC was composed of 81.01% ± 0.45% crude protein (dry basis) and 16.78% ± 0.26% total lipid (dry basis), exhibited excellent amino-acid composition in all the essential amino acids, exceeding the requirements of the FAO/WHO/UNU for food protein, and was rich in omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, especially eicosapentaenoic (EPA) and docosahexaenoic (DHA) acids present in phospholipids. The fluoride level of FKPC was 79.79 ± 2.10 μg/g (dry basis), which met the USFDA requirements. The surimi yield reached 43.74%, and the mean recovery rate of protein and fat was 52.68% and 41.44%, respectively. The nutritional value, safe level of fluoride, and high yield rate provide evidence that FKPC has a promising future in the food industry as a new aquatic protein and lipid resource. © 2017 Taylor & Francis.",2-s2.0-85030484111

The objective of this study was to investigate the stability of krill powder when stored for up to 12 months at room temperature. In addition, the effect of packaging in vacuum was observed. The stability was assessed by changes in concentrations of lipid classes, antioxidants, pyrroles and lipid, and Strecker-derived volatiles. Some degradation occurred during storage at room temperature. Thus, a minor increase in volatiles, an increase in free fatty acids and a concomitant decrease in antioxidants, tocopherol, and astaxanthin was observed. In addition, there was a minor decrease in phospholipids and n-3 fatty acids; however, storage at vacuum improved the oxidative stability of krill powder. Practical applications: For the use of krill powder in human nutrition, it is important, that the quality and stability is sufficiently high to retain the nutritional value during storage. This study contributes with information about the stability during storage up to 12 months at room temperature and the effect of packaging the powder in vacuum. Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) is a shrimp-like marine crustacean. It is rich in omega-3 fatty acids, primarily bound in phospholipids in the sn-2 position of the molecule, making it highly bioavailable.

Nephrops are sold either whole, or as ""tails-only"" for the scampi trade. In the ""tailing"" process, the ""head"" (cephalothorax) is discarded as waste. A smaller crustacean species, the Antarctic krill Euphasia superba, represents an economically valuable industry, as its extractable oil is sold as a human dietary supplement. The aim of this study was to determine the amount and composition of the oil contained in discarded Nephrops heads and to compare its composition to the oil extracted from krill. Differences due to Geographical variation and seasonal patterns in the amount and composition of lipid were also noted. Results indicated that Nephrops head waste samples collected from more southern locations in Scotland (Clyde Sea area) contained higher levels of oil when compared to samples collected from northern locations in Iceland. Moreover, seasonal differences within the Clyde Sea area in Scotland were also observed, with oil extracted from Nephrops head waste peaking at around 11.5% during the summer months when larger and more mature females were caught by trawl. At this time of the year, the valuable fatty acids eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) accounted for around 23% of the total fatty acid content in oil extracted from Nephrops head waste. A seasonal effect on EPA content was found, with higher levels obtained in the summer, while no trend was found in DHA percentages. Finally, oil from Nephrops head waste contained a higher proportion of EPA and DHA than krill oil but these fatty acids were more abundantly linked to the neutral lipids rather to than polar lipids. The characterization of lipid that could be extracted from Nephrops head waste should be seen as a first step for the commercial use of a valuable resource currently wasted. This approach is extremely relevant given the current limited supply of EPA and DHA and changes in the Common Fisheries Policy. © 2016 The Author(s).",2-s2.0-85007470624

Our study assessed the condition of larval (furcilia VI) and one year old juvenile krill collected in East Antarctica (115°E–130°E and 64°S–66°S) from September to October 2012. Krill condition was assessed using morphometric, elemental and biochemical body composition, growth rates, oxygen uptake and lipid content and composition. Diet was assessed using fatty acid biomarkers analysed in the krill. The growth rate of larvae was 0.0038 mm day with an inter-moult period of 14 days. The average oxygen uptake of juvenile krill was 0.30±0.02 μl oxygen consumed per mg dry weight per hour. Although protein was not significantly different amongst the krill analysed, the lipid content of krill was highly variable ranging from 9% to 27% dry weight in juveniles and from 4% to 13% dry weight in larvae.

The by-products are worthy of utilization because of the high ratio to the total weight (65.7%). The crude protein contents in the muscle and by-products of krill are 17.4 and 11.7%, respectively. The krill proteins have higher contents of essential amino acids (EAAs). The EAAs constitute 42 and 37% of the TAAs in muscle and by-products, respectively.

Euphausia superba and Euphausia crystallorophias, which are dominant Antarctic krill, are major prey for most predators, such as fishes, birds, and marine mammals. An understanding of the feeding ecology of krill may provide the information for the structure and function of the Amundsen Sea ecosystem. Thus, we applied two biochemical approaches (fatty acids and stable isotopes) to determine the trophodynamics of adult krill in the Amundsen Sea. There were no significant differences in lipid contents between the two species, but the dominant storage lipids were different. Triacylglycerol (TAG) was dominant in E. superba, but wax esters (WE) were dominant in E. crystallorophias due to their different living strategies. Furthermore, the lipid content of E. crystallorophias displayed a spatial variation, being highest on the glacial edge. It was difficult to understand the feeding strategy and food source using only the fatty acid compositions of krill and in situ particulate organic matter. However, we found that specific FA ratios (18:1ω9/18:1ω7 and PUFA/SFA) and the nitrogen isotope ratio (δ15N) provide more insight into the feeding ecology of krill, such as feeding strategy and trophic position. These ratios suggest that E. crystallorophias consistently showed a higher degree of carnivorous feeding than E. superba in the Amundsen Sea during the austral summer. In conclusion, adult E. superba might more directly obtain their energy from in situ primary producers in the open sea, but, in the Amundsen Sea Polynya, adult E. crystallorophias seems to obtain their energy mainly through the microbial loop (microzooplankton). If so, E. crystallolophias would be a key player not only to transfer the energy from microbes to higher trophic levels but also to control the carbon and nitrogen cycle in the Amundsen Sea Polynya. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.",2-s2.0-84958111223

Krill oil (RIMFROST Sublime®) is a phospholipid-rich oil with eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA): docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) ratio of 1.8:1. In this pilot study we determined if krill oil could favourable affect plasma lipid parameters and parameters involved in the initiation and progression of atherosclerosis. Methods: The study was conducted as a 28 days intervention study examining effect-parameters of dietary supplementation with krill oil (832.5 mg EPA and DHA per day). 17 healthy volunteers in the age group 18-36 (mean age 23 ± 4 years) participated. Plasma lipids, lipoprotein particle sizes, fatty acid composition in plasma and red blood cells (RBCs), plasma cytokines, antioxidant capacity, acylcarntines, carnitine, choline, betaine, and trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO) were measured before and after supplementation. Results: Plasma triacylglycerol (TAG) and large very-low density lipoprotein (VLDL) & chylomicron particle concentrations decreased after 28 days of krill oil intake. A significant reduction in the TAG/HDL cholesterol resulted. Krill oil supplementation decreased n-6/n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) ratio both in plasma and RBCs. This was due to increased EPA, DHA and docosapentaenoic acid (DPA) and reduced amount of arachidonic acid (AA). The increase of n-3 fatty acids and wt % of EPA and DHA in RBC was of smaller magnitude than found in plasma. Krill oil intake increased the antioxidant capacity, double bond index (DBI) and the fatty acid anti-inflammatory index. The plasma atherogenicity index remained constant whereas the thrombogenicity index decreased. Plasma choline, betaine and the carnitine precursor, γ-butyrobetaine were increased after krill oil supplementation whereas the TMAO and carnitine concentrations remained unchanged. Conclusion: Krill oil consumption is considered health beneficial as it decreases cardiovascular disease risk parameters through effects on plasma TAGs, lipoprotein particles, fatty acid profile, redox status and possible inflammation.

Obesity is encouraged by current obesogenic environmental conditions that promote the intake of high-energy-dense foods and increased portion sizes. Cafeteria animal models provide a useful tool to study the metabolic syndrome in humans. Several animal studies and clinical trials suggest that marine bioactive oils supply may have potential effects on obesity and its associated features. Thus, the aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of krill oil enrichment in cafeteria-diet-overfed rats and their capacity to respond to acute changes on some antioxidant/ oxidant markers. Methods Eighteen aging male Wistar rats were divided into three groups of six each and were exposed for the ensuing 8 weeks to one of the diets: control group (C) which was submitted to standard chow (330kcal/100g), containing 24% of proteins, 5% of lipids and 70% of carbohydrates. Cafeteria standard group (CS) exposed to cafeteria diet (420kcal/100 g) containing 30 g of standard chow and 30 g of sausage-dry cookies mixture, cheese, chips, chocolate, and peanuts in proportions of 2:2:2: 1:1:1. The last group received a cafeteria diet enriched in oral force-feeding krill oil 2% (KO-CS). Results Despite modest differences in body weight, cafeteria-fed animals underwent an exacerbated body fat accumulation and increased metabolic risk. The substitution of standard chow diet by the cafeteria diet induced several disturbances in term of metabolic response to the radical attack in key tissues involved in antioxidant defense as demonstrated by the increase of TBARS, 8-OHdG DNA damages marker and isoprostanes levels in cafeteria-diet-fed rats. The serum TBARS, 8-OHdG and isoprostanes levels were significantly lowered by 45% and 25% respectively in the in the KO-CS group compared to CS group. Serum uric acid and albumin contents were decreased respectively by 36% and 18% in the krill oil enriched CS group as compared to cafeteria group. Conclusions A short period of exposure to a cafeteria diet in is enough to disturb the metabolic response to the radical attack in key tissues involved in antioxidant defense. The important antioxidant activity of KO could probably be due to its bioactive compounds (n-3 PUFA, phenolic compounds, alpha-tocopherol, manganese). Thus, its incorporation in a dietetic program can be strategically effective for the prevention/management, indeed improvement of free radical attack in obese subjects, which will prevent the obesity complications. © 2015 Elsevier Masson SAS",2-s2.0-85033688205

However, other plasma risk factors linked to cardiovascular disease are less studied. This study aimed to penetrate the effect of a phospholipid-protein complex (PPC) from Antarctic krill on one-carbon metabolism and production of trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO) in rats. Male Wistar rats were fed isoenergetic control, 6%, or 11% PPC diets for four weeks. Rats fed PPC had reduced total homocysteine plasma level and increased levels of choline, dimethylglycine and cysteine, whereas the plasma level of methionine was unchanged compared to control. PPC feeding increased the plasma level of TMAO, carnitine, its precursors trimethyllysine and γ-butyrobetaine. There was a close correlation between plasma TMAO and carnitine, trimethyllysine, and γ-butyrobetaine, but not between TMAO and choline. The present data suggest that PPC has a homocysteine lowering effect and is associated with altered plasma concentrations of metabolites related to one-carbon metabolism and B-vitamin status in rats. Moreover, the present study reveals a non-obligatory role of gut microbiota in the increased plasma TMAO level as it can be explained by the PPC's content of TMAO. The increased level of carnitine and carnitine precursors is interpreted to reflect increased carnitine biosynthesis. © 2015 by the authors; licensee MDPI.",2-s2.0-84943170851

Furthermore, we discuss the findings in relation to the possible different health effects, focusing on lipids, inflammatory markers, cardiovascular disease risk, and biological functions of these two sources of long-chain n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs). Methods: A literature search was conducted in PubMed in January 2015. In total, 113 articles were identified, but based on selection criteria, 14 original papers were included in the review. Results: Studies on bioavailability of EPA and DHA from KO and FO in humans and animals are limited and the interpretation is difficult, as different amounts of EPA and DHA have been used, duration of intervention differs, and different study groups have been included. Two human studies – one postprandial study and one intervention study – used the same amount of EPA and DHA from KO or FO, and they both showed that the bioavailability of EPA and DHA from KO seems to be higher than that from FO. Limited effects of KO and FO on lipids and inflammatory markers in human and animal studies were reported. Gene expression data from animal studies showed that FO upregulated the cholesterol synthesis pathway, which was the opposite of the effect mediated by KO. KO also regulated far more metabolic pathways than FO, which may indicate different biological effects of KO and FO. Conclusion: There seems to be a difference in bioavailability of EPA and DHA after intake of KO and FO, but more studies are needed before a firm conclusion can be made. It is also necessary to document the beneficial health effects of KO with more human studies and to elucidate if these effects differ from those after regular fish and FO intake. ©2015 Ulven and Holven.",2-s2.0-84940729245

In addition, there is growing evidence that proteins of marine origin may have health benefits. We investigated a phospholipid-protein complex (PPC) from krill that is hypothesized to influence lipid metabolism, inflammation, and redox status. Male Wistar rats were fed a control diet (2% soy oil, 8% lard, 20% casein), or diets where corresponding amounts of casein and lard were replaced with PPC at 3%, 6%, or 11% (wt %), for four weeks. Dietary supplementation with PPC resulted in significantly lower levels of plasma triacylglycerols in the 11% PPC-fed group, probably due to reduced hepatic lipogenesis. Plasma cholesterol levels were also reduced at the highest dose of PPC. In addition, the plasma and liver content of n-3 PUFAs increased while n-6 PUFAs decreased. This was associated with increased total antioxidant capacity in plasma and increased liver gene expression of mitochondrial superoxide dismutase (Sod2). Finally, a reduced plasma level of the inflammatory mediator interleukin-2 (IL-2) was detected in the PPC-fed animals. The present data show that PPC has lipid-lowering effects in rats, and may modulate risk factors related to cardiovascular disease progression. © 2015 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",2-s2.0-84938246745

It is not exactly known whether the scarcity of food or an internal clock, set by the natural Antarctic light regime, are responsible for non-feeding. Our research questions were therefore the following: (1) How will physiological and biochemical conditions of krill change during long-term starvation at constant light regime? (2) If and how do enzyme activities change during such starvation? (3) What is the influence of food availability versus that of light regime? To answer these questions, adult krill were starved under laboratory conditions for 12 weeks with constant light regime (12:12; dark/light) and the impact on physiological functions was studied. Initial experimental condition of krill resembled the condition of late spring krill in the field with fully active metabolism and low lipid reserves. Metabolic activity and activities of enzymes catabolising lipids decreased after the onset of starvation and remained low throughout, whereas lipid reserves declined and lipid composition changed. Mass and size of krill decreased while the inter-moult period increased. Depletion of storage- and structural metabolites occurred in the order of depot lipids and glycogen reserves after onset of starvation until proteins were almost exclusively used after 6–7 weeks of starvation. Results confirmed various proposed overwintering mechanisms such as metabolic slowdown, slow growth or shrinkage and use of lipid reserves. However, these changes were set in motion by food shortage only, i.e. without the trigger of a changing light regime. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",2-s2.0-84929946201

Food sources are particularly scarce during winter. Herbivorous krill, such as the arcto-boreal Thysanoessa inermis, are key components in the ecosystem of Kongsfjord and strongly rely on phytoplankton as a food source. During the polar night such species must therefore be adapted to survive long periods without significant nutritional input. We investigated physiological mechanisms and the allocation of energy resources to try to explain how T. inermis manages to survive the Arctic winter. Adult specimens caught in late summer were kept under starvation conditions for 28 d. Changes in metabolic rates (respiration and excretion) and biochemical composition (protein, lipid and fatty acid analyses) were monitored. In contrast to the Antarctic krill Euphausia superba and the subtropical E. hanseni, the arcto-boreal species did not reduce metabolism but utilized lipid reserves for survival. Assessed from total lipid stores and energy demand, the potential survival period was estimated at 63 d without food uptake, which is not sufficient to survive the entire winter. Results were compared to specimens that overwintered in situ and were discussed in relation to other euphausiids. In conclusion, T. inermis is well adapted to survive the Arctic winter provided that alternative food sources are available, but has a different strategy to cope with starvation than krill species from other latitudes. © The authors 2015.",2-s2.0-84924904578

We used lipid biomarkers to quantify feeding patterns and relate the variability in biomarkers to environmental conditions that structure the phytoplankton community. Fatty acid profiles varied among years, with some years dominated by lipids indicative of herbivory, while other years were indicative of greater omnivory. Principal component analysis of 60 fatty acids showed that 3 principal components (PCs) explained approximately 50% of the variability in fatty acid profiles. The first PC separated the fatty acid indicators along a herbivory-omnivory-carnivory gradient. Correlations between the gradient of herbivory and carnivory, as summarized by the first PC, were found with both winter sea ice extent (r = 0.55, p < 0.01) and with ENSO conditions the previous winter (r = 0.88, p < 0.001).

Across 92 stations, representing a year-round average, the food volume in krill stomachs comprised 71 ± 29% algae, 17 ± 21% protozoans, and 12 ± 25% metazoans. Fatty acid trophic markers showed that copepods were consistently part of krill diet, not a switch food. In open waters, both diatom and copepod consumption increased with phytoplankton abundance. Under sea ice, ingestion of diatoms became rare, whereas feeding on copepods remained constant. During winter, larvae contained high but variable proportions of diatom markers, whereas in postlarvae the role of copepods increased with krill body length. Overwintering differed according to habitat. Krill from South Georgia had lower lipid stores than those from the Bransfield Strait or Lazarev Sea. Feeding effort was much reduced in Lazarev Sea krill, whereas most individuals from the Bransfield Strait and South Georgia contained phytoplankton and seabed detritus in their stomachs. Their retention of essential body reserves indicates that krill experienced most winter hardship in the Lazarev Sea, followed by South Georgia and then Bransfield Strait. This was reflected in the delayed development from juveniles to adults in the Lazarev Sea. Circumpolar comparisons of length frequencies suggest that krill growth conditions are more favorable in the southwest Atlantic than in the Lazarev Sea or off East Antarctica because of longer phytoplankton bloom periods and rewarding access to benthic food. © 2014, by the Association for the Sciences of Limnology and Oceanography, Inc.",2-s2.0-84892762721

In addition, the development of aquaculture requires more fishmeal and fish oil. Humanisation of care of companion animals is also associated with addition of LC n-3 PUFA in pet foods. The risk of the increased demand for LC n-3 PUFA is the excess harvesting of natural sources, especially of marine origin (oily fishes, krill). In order to improve sustainability, alternative sources of LC n-3 PUFA have been developed. These alternative sources are: (a) terrestrial plants naturally or genetically enriched in stearidonic acid (SDA), which bypasses the first limiting step of (i.e. Δ6 desaturase) of the biosynthesis of LC n-3 PUFA; (b) single-cell oils rich in LC n-3 PUFA (microalgae, Escherichia coli) and krill.

Fluctuations in lipid energy stores are known to profoundly affect the toxicokinetics of lipophilic organochlorine compound (OC) burdens. Results from blubber biopsy sampling of adult, male humpback whales at two time points of the annual migration journey revealed dramatic concentration effects for the majority of OC compounds. The observed concentration effect was, however, not linear with measured average blubber lipid loss indicating significant redistribution of OCs and hence the importance of alternate lipid depots for meeting the energetic demands of the migration journey. Applying lipophilic OC burdens as novel tracers of whole-body lipid dynamics, the observed average concentration index suggests an average individual weight loss of 13% over 4 months of the migration journey. This value is based upon lipid derived energy and is in good agreement with previous weight prediction formulas. Notably, however, these estimates may greatly underestimate individual weight loss if significant protein catabolism occurs. Biomagnification factors between migrating southern hemisphere humpback whales and their principal prey item, Antarctic krill, closely resembled those of baleen whales feeding on herbivorous zooplankton in the Arctic.

Ice algae and pelagic phytoplankton represent the primary sources of nutrition for higher trophic-level organisms in seasonally ice-covered areas, but their relative contributions to polar marine consumers remain largely unexplored. Here, we investigated the potential of diatom-specific lipid markers and highly branched isoprenoids (HBIs) for estimating the importance of these two carbon pools in an Antarctic pelagic ecosystem. Using GC-MS analysis, we studied HBI biomarkers in key marine species over three years in Adélie Land, Antarctica: euphausiids (ice krill Euphausia crystallorophias and Antarctic krill E. superba), fish (bald notothens Pagothenia borchgrevinki and Antarctic silverfish Pleuragramma antarcticum) and seabirds (Adélie penguins Pygoscelis adeliae, snow petrels Pagodroma nivea and cape petrels Daption capense). This study provides the first evidence of the incorporation of HBI lipids in Antarctic pelagic consumers. Specifically, a di-unsaturated HBI (diene) of sea ice origin was more abundant in ice-associated species than in pelagic species, whereas a tri-unsaturated HBI (triene) of phytoplanktonic origin was more abundant in pelagic species than in ice-associated species. Moreover, the relative abundances of diene and triene in seabird tissues and eggs were higher during a year of good sea ice conditions than in a year of poor ice conditions. In turn, the higher contribution of ice algal derived organic matter to the diet of seabirds was related to earlier breeding and higher breeding success. HBI biomarkers are a promising tool for estimating the contribution of organic matter derived from ice algae in pelagic consumers from Antarctica. © 2013 Goutte et al.",2-s2.0-84873926844

This review aims to summarise these data and show where it resides, to assist SO food-web modellers or those with limited specialist knowledge of SO zooplankton. First, a brief overview is provided of the diversity and basic biology of SO zooplankton, with an emphasis on abundance, distribution and feeding. Second, advice is provided on the uses, strengths and limitations of zooplankton data as inputs to SO data compilations or food-web models. Copepods overall comprise &gt;75% of the SO zooplankton biomass (excluding Euphausia superba). Total mesozooplankton biomass density differs little between the Antarctic sectors, but latitudinally it is maximal in the Polar Frontal Zone and declines to the north and south. Those compiling data on numerical density (no. m-2 or no. m-3) need to allow for differences in the extent of identification of early larval stages. Likewise, the time of year, depth of sampling and mesh size of sampler greatly influence the recorded abundance, since the populations can make seasonal vertical migrations and their pulsed reproduction causes great seasonal changes in size structure and abundance. Other issues are specific to polar environments, for example, lipid storage which leads to significantly different length-mass and mass-rate relationships than are reported in global literature compilations. Likewise, stenothermy (narrow temperature tolerance) means that fixed (Q10-type) temperature relationships based on global literature compilations must be applied with great caution in SO-specific studies. Protozoa/micrometazoa (&lt;200 μm) are the main grazers in the SO, since mesozooplankton typically remove &lt;30% of primary production. This emphasises the dominant role of microbial food chains involving small metazoans, relative to the classic short diatom-krill-whale type food chains. Even within regions of abundant krill, copepod production in summer roughly triples that of postlarval E. superba. This fact reflects a large flow of energy through multiple trophic levels, via copepods and their major invertebrate predators such as other predatory copepods, chaetognaths, small omnivorous euphausiids, amphipods up to myctophid fish and birds.",2-s2.0-84878045742

Krill powder fed mice displayed lowered hepatic and plasma triacylglycerol levels compared to mice on a high-fat casein diet. This was accompanied by down-regulated hepatic expression of genes involved in lipogenesis and glycerolipid synthesis, and increased β-oxidation activity. In addition, the krill powder diet lowered plasma levels of cholesterol, as well as hepatic gene expression of sterol regulatory element binding transcription factor 2 (SREBP2) and enzymes involved in cholesterol synthesis. Notably, genes involved in glycolysis and gluconeogenesis were significantly reduced in liver by the krill powder diet, while genes involved in oxidative phosphorylation and uncoupling were not affected.

However, direct observations during spring are rare. Here we studied krill body condition and maturity stage in relation to feeding (i.e. stomach fullness, diet, absorption of individual fatty acids and defecation rate) across the Scotia Sea in November 2006. The phytoplankton concentrations were low at the marginal ice zone (MIZ) in the southern Scotia Sea (Stn. 1, 2, and 3), high in open waters of the Southern Antarctic Circumpolar Current Front (SACCF) in the central Scotia Sea (Stn. 5), and moderate further north (Stn. 6 and 7). Krill had low lipid reserves (~6.5% of dry mass, DM), low mass:length ratios (~1.7mgDMmm -1), and small digestive glands (~7% of total DM) near the ice edge. The stomachs contained lithogenic particles, diatom debris, and bacterial fatty acids, but low proportions of diatom-indicating fatty acids, which suggest that these krill were feeding on detritus rather than on fresh ice algae. In the SACCF, krill had higher lipid reserves (~10% of DM), high mass:length ratios (~2.2mgDMmm -1), and large digestive glands (~16% of total DM). Stomach content and tissue composition indicate feeding on diatoms. In the north, moderate food concentrations co-occurred with low lipid reserves in krill, and moderate mass:length ratios and digestive gland sizes. Only in the phytoplankton bloom in the SACCF had the mating season already started and some females were about to spawn. Based on the way krill processed their food at the different stations, we indicate two mechanisms that can lead to fast regeneration of body reserves and oocyte maturation in E. superba. One is ""superfluous"" feeding at high food concentrations, which maximises the overall nutrient gain. The other is a preferential absorption of crucial fatty acids: 20:5(n-3) and 22:6(n-3) when regaining body condition after the winter, and 14:0 and 16:1(n-7) during accumulation of oocyte yolk. Multi-year time series of phytoplankton distribution show that an early spring bloom, as found in 2006, is not unusual for the central Scotia Sea and coincides with high krill larval concentrations in this area. In conclusion, the Scotia Sea is a main spawning ground of Antarctic krill and this is linked to phytoplankton blooms in open waters of the SACCF rather than to ice edge blooms. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.",2-s2.0-84855947024

A second aim is to clarify the extent to which seasonal variation in larval and adult krill physiology is mediated by environmental factors with a strong seasonality, such as food supply or day light. Experimental studies on adult krill have demonstrated that specific physiological adaptations during autumn and winter, such as reduced metabolic rates and feeding activity, are not caused simply by the scarcity of food, as was previously assumed. These adaptations appear to be influenced by the local light regime. The physiological functions that larval krill adopt during winter (reduced metabolism, delayed development, lipid utilisation, and variable growth rates) are, in contrast to the adults, under direct control by the available food supply. During winter, the adults often seem to have little association with sea ice (at least until early spring). The larvae, however, feed within sea ice but mainly on the grazers of the ice algal community rather than on the algae themselves. In this respect, a miss-match in timing of the occurrence of the last phytoplankton blooms in autumn and the start of the sea ice formation, as has been increasingly observed in the west Antarctic Peninsula (WAP) region, will impact larval krill development during winter in terms of food supply and consequently the krill stock in this region. © 2011 The Author(s).",2-s2.0-82255191953

It is the most abundant species of krill, which catchable stock is believed to amount up to 10 million tons per year, and may be the most potential marine resource for utilization as food in the world. This paper compared the nutritional components and heavy metals of edible portions of Antarctic krill, greasy-back shrimp (Metapenaeus ensis), Chinese white prawn (Exopalaemon modestus), and oriental river prawn (Macrobrachium nipponense). Antarctic krill meat contained 76.39% of water, 17.22% of crude proteins, 2.66% of crude lipids, and 1.43% of ashes, respectively. At dry basis, Antarctic krill had relatively lower content of crude protein (72.92%) than oriental river prawn (85.35%), greasy-back shrimp (81.12%), or Chinese white prawn (78.18%). However, it had significantly higher lipid content (11.25%) than the three species of shrimps (4.89%∼6.65%). And the total amino acids in dry samples of Antarctic krill meat was 74.46g/100g, which was lower than the shrimps, but the essential amino acid content (45.90g/100g protein) was higher than others. Regarding to minerals, no significant difference was found in Antarctic krill and the shrimps, with exceptions that Antarctic krill contained two to three times higher content of magnesium (458.28mg/100g) and copper (4.96mg/100g) than shrimps. In addition, the heavy metals including lead (Pb), mercury (Hg), arsenic (As), chromium (Cr) in Antarctic krill meat met the limit standard of contaminants in aquatic products. But fluorine content of Antarctic krill meat surpassed the safety limit (2.0mg/kg) and might be a safety concern. © (2012) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.",2-s2.0-80555148875

Environmental conflicts and a limited freshwater supply constrain further developments in agriculture; global fisheries have levelled off, and aquaculture may have to play a more prominent role in supplying human food. Freshwater is important, but it is also a major challenge to cultivate the oceans in an environmentally, economically and energyfriendly way. To support this, a long-term vision must be to derive new sources of feed, primarily taken from outside the human food chain, and to move carnivore production to a lower trophic level. The main aim of this paper is to speculate on how feed supplies can be produced for an expanding aquaculture industry by and beyond 2050 and to establish a roadmap of the actions needed to achieve this. Resources from agriculture, fish meal and fish oil are the major components of pellet fish feeds. All cultured animals take advantage of a certain fraction of fish meal in the feed, and marine carnivores depend on a supply of marine lipids containing highly unsaturated fatty acids (HUFA, with ≥3 double bonds and ≥20 carbon chain length) in the feed. The availability of HUFA is likely the main constraint for developing carnivore aquaculture in the next decades. The availability of fish meal and oil will decrease, and the competition for plant products will increase. New harvested resources are herbivore zooplankton, such as Antarctic krill and red feed, and new produced resources are macroalgae, transgenic higher HUFA-producing plants and bacterial biomass. These products are to a limited extent components of the human food chain, and all these resources will help to move cultured carnivores to lower trophic levels and can thereby increase the production capacity and the sustainability of the production. Mariculture can only become as successful as agriculture in the coming century if carnivores can be produced at around Trophic Level 2, based mainly on plant resources. There is little potential for increasing the traditional fish meal food chain in aquaculture. © Inter-Research 2011.",2-s2.0-84857662077

Lipid and fatty acid content and composition were determined in field and laboratory samples. Developmental stages analyzed in embryos included: multiple-cell, gastrula, and limb-bud stages. Larval stages analyzed included: nauplius I, nauplius II, and metanauplius. Laboratory-reared embryos were spawned by gravid females incubated under three feeding groups: (1) phytoplankton mixture, (2) phytoplankton mixture and minced clam, and (3) phytoplankton mixture, minced clam, and commercial larval food. Hatching success was highest in group 3 (100%), lowest in group 1 (0%), and highly variable in field samples (0-48%). Lipid decreased slightly in embryos during embryonic development, while large decreases in lipid were found during nauplius development. High levels of 18:2(n-6), 20:4(n-6), and 22:6(n-3) observed with group 3 samples coincided with high hatching success in krill embryos. The ratio of 22:6(n-3)/20:5(n-3) also correlated to hatching success of embryos. The fatty acid profile of embryos in group 3 was similar to that of the field-collected embryos, reflecting the contribution of the commercial larval food in the maternal diet. In our study, the maternal diet was found to influence the fatty acid composition of embryos and in turn affects the hatching success of krill.

Chick obesity functions as a buffer against irregular attentiveness by parents delivering meals. Surprisingly the assimilation mechanism necessary to attain obesity remains unclear. This study presents the first measurements of assimilation efficiency in relation to age and diet throughout the long nestling period of a Procellariidae. To determine the assimilation efficiency and diet effects on growth, Shorttailed Shearwater Puffinus tenuirostris chicks were fed in captivity on different diets of marine organisms (krill Euphausia superba, squid Nototodarus sloani and fish Hyperlophus vittatus) from age 10 to 85 days. Assimilation efficiency was highest (mean 93.7%) among young chicks (10-29 days old) then declined, becoming stable (mean 80.9%) among older (70-85 days old) pre-fledging chicks. It was noted that the krill-fed chicks showed consistently higher assimilation efficiencies, not only when young (mean 95.4%) but also when older (mean 84.8%), than the squid-fed or fish-fed chicks (means 92.4-93.3% when young and 78.4-79.5% when older). The krill diet contributed to better growth in body mass (close to that of free-living chicks at the source colony), while the squid- and fish-fed chicks grew slowly. The dietary effects on feather growth and molting did not parallel those on body mass increments. Squid-fed chicks had similar feather growth rates and molt progress to those of krillfed chicks, whereas fish-fed chicks often vomited their food when given sizable quantities of fish and had slower feather development and molting. These findings suggest that chicks may need parental digestive fluids in order to facilitate their digestion of larger amounts of fish, whereas they were competent to digest krill and squid on their own. When the diet of older (over 85 days of age) fish-fed chicks was changed to krill they stopped regurgitating food, gained weight and began rapid molting. Likewise, squid-fed chicks gained mass at a faster rate when they were switched to a diet of krill. The experimental Short-tailed Shearwater chicks were found to have a high absorption capability during the early nestling stage allowing for considerable lipid accumulation and resulting in obesity. This obesity facilitates the fasting necessary while their parents commute to distant nutritive waters. The shearwaters have a highly adaptive potential to assimilate krill, which are abundant organisms with a large biomass in the higher latitudes that shearwaters prefer to inhabit for foraging throughout the year. Even the krill-fed chicks, the best among the three experimental dietary groups, only attained similar body masses to free-living chicks despite being given 1.9 times as heavy meals as shearwater parents provided to their free-living chicks. This evidence indicates that in order for free-living Short-tailed Shearwater chicks to grow to obesity, they depend on a far higher energy intake than that available in their diet alone. The specific oil, accumulated in the shearwater parents' proventriculus, and delivered to the chick, is an important contribution. In other words, digestible prey, such as krill, and parental stomach oil, are both essential to insure obesity for Short-tailed Shearwater chicks. © The Ornithological Society of Japan 2011.",2-s2.0-84863804139

However, information on growth, diet and condition during winter and early spring is limited, hampering our understanding of these fundamental biological parameters at this important period in their lifecycle. Our study assessed diet and condition of larval and postlarval krill collected from open water and below the ice off East Antarctica (110-130oE) in September/October 2007. Condition was assessed using lipid content, growth rates and digestive gland size; feeding history was assessed using fatty acid profiles and stomach content analysis; and a 207-day starvation study investigated the response of krill to long-term food deprivation. Potential food items (Calanus propinquus and sea-ice biota) were analysed for lipid and fatty acid composition to compare with krill samples. Krill were found to be in good condition, with mean growth rate of 0.95% per moult for postlarvae and 14.79% for larvae, and mean lipid content of 24.1% for postlarvae and 6.6% for larvae. Fatty acid profiles and stomach content analysis revealed two main feeding strategies - krill below the ice were feeding mostly on sea-ice diatoms, while those in open water were ingesting copepods and detritus. Krill below the ice had larger digestive glands than those in open water. Furciliae fatty acid profiles indicated a diet of heterotrophic flagellates and/or detritus. Postlarval krill survived 207 days of food deprivation by using body protein and lipid reserves for energy. In contrast, krill furciliae were severely depleted after just 5 days of food deprivation, indicating that they must feed continually at this time of year. Krill, copepods and sea-ice biota were all low in polyunsaturated fatty acids, indicating that krill must rely on later spring phytoplankton blooms to obtain these essential nutrients required for reproduction. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.",2-s2.0-79954631978

Supplement with n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) has been shown to improve cardiac function in HF and to decrease mortality after myocardial infarction (MI). The molecular structure and composition of n-3 PUFA varies between different marine sources and this may be of importance for their biological effects. Krill oil, unlike fish oil supplements, contains the major part of the n-3 PUFA in the form of phospholipids. This study investigated effects of krill oil on cardiac remodeling after experimental MI. Rats were randomised to pre-treatment with krill oil or control feed 14 days before induction of MI. Seven days post-MI, the rats were examined with echocardiography and rats in the control group were further randomised to continued control feed or krill oil feed for 7 weeks before re-examination with echocardiography and euthanization. Results: The echocardiographic evaluation showed significant attenuation of LV dilatation in the group pretreated with krill oil compared to controls. Attenuated heart weight, lung weight, and levels of mRNA encoding classical markers of LV stress, matrix remodeling and inflammation reflected these findings. The total composition of fatty acids were examined in the left ventricular (LV) tissue and all rats treated with krill oil showed a significantly higher proportion of n-3 PUFA in the LV tissue, although no difference was seen between the two krill oil groups. Conclusions: Supplement with krill oil leads to a proportional increase of n-3 PUFA in myocardial tissue and supplement given before induction of MI attenuates LV remodeling. © 2011 Fosshaug et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",2-s2.0-84855182030

The study was carried out in order to map the species of the choline-containing phospholipid classes: phosphatidylcholine and lyso-phosphatidylcholine. In addition, the prevalent phosphatidylcholine class was quantified and the results compared with prior analysis. The qualification was performed with separation on a reverse phase chromatography column, while the quantification was obtained with class separation on a normal phase chromatography column. An Orbitrap system was used for the detection, and pulsed-Q dissociation fragmentation was utilized for the identification of the species. An asymmetrical exclusion list was applied for detection of phospholipid species of lower concentration, significantly improving the number of species observed. A total of 69 choline-containing phospholipids were detected, whereof 60 phosphatidylcholine substances, among others seven with probable omega-3 fatty acids in both sn-1 and sn-2. The phosphatidylcholine concentration was estimated to be 34 ± 5 g/100 g oil (n = 5).

In this study we examined the ability of the stable isotope analysis (δ15N and δ13C) of milk to infer seasonal variations in the diets and foraging habitats of female Antarctic fur seals (Arctocephalus gazella) breeding at Cape Shirreff, Livingston Island, Antarctica. We found that the stable nitrogen values of lipid-free milk were correlated with seasonal changes in female diet composition during the lactation period identified from scat collections. While we could not fully quantifying female diets using isotopic analysis, evidence from both scat collections and stable isotope analysis suggest that Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) remained a major dietary item throughout lactation. In addition, these two methods independently highlighted the increasing importance of fish and squid in the diets of females as the season progresses. Furthermore, the isotopic values of milk collected during the perinatal fast suggest that females may be foraging in high productivity areas north of the South Shetland Islands and consume a larger proportion of fish and/or squid prior to parturition. While more confirmatory studies are needed to refine these methods, our results suggests that the δ15N and δ13C values of lipid-free milk can be used as a proxy to describe the foraging ecology of female Antarctic fur seals prior to and across the lactation period. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.",2-s2.0-77957891299

This species shows an evolution in morphometry, its carapace length increases slightly with sexual maturation, and its second thoracic leg becomes bigger and stronger, as well as its dactylus and especially the setae in the dactylus, which are stronger in a bigger animal allowing them to feed on other lipid-rich zooplankton. All these characteristics seem to support the hypothesis that animals change their diet during this period, allowing them to grow faster during summer, and accumulate lipids as a reserve material. This hypothesis is supported by a steeper slope in the length-weight regression during summer and an even steeper slope of the regression between carapace length and total lipids, especially adults. Great differences in lipid content were found between subadults and adults during this season, being higher in adults and, especially females. Lipids were higher in the northern stations in frontal area. A significant difference in lipid content was found among the stations sampled. Also a significant difference in lipid content was found between subadults, males and females. The species has a longer reproductive season than previously thought, which could depend on local conditions. Its development is accelerated during the summer bloom. Life history strategies of subadults and adults are apparently quite different, according to our lipid results and morphometrics data. Lipids reserves in subadults are not accumulated during summer, thus, T. macrura must accumulate massive amounts of lipids during autumn or late summer as a survival strategy of the species, as proposed for other species. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Lipid content as a function of sex/maturity stage and season was used to calculate the energy density of krill ingested by chicks. Simulations tested the influence of variability in krill size-class distribution, sex-ratio, length-at-maturity, and the timing of spawning on krill population energy density and penguin chick fledging mass. Of the parameters included in simulations, variability in the timing of krill spawning had the greatest influence on predicted Adélie penguin fledging mass, with fledging mass decreasing from 3.30 to 2.92 kg when peak spawning was shifted from early December to early March. Adélie penguin chicks that fledge from colonies along the western Antarctic Peninsula (wAP) and survive to recruit into the breeding population are 0.117 kg heavier than those that do not survive to breed. Thus, it appears that small differences in fledging mass potentially have significant implications for Adélie penguin chick survivorship. Therefore, the timing of krill spawning may have important consequences for Adélie penguins, and other top-predator species, that may time critical activities to coincide with a period of dependable prey availability with maximum energy density. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.",2-s2.0-77949656190

Metabolic data, elemental and biochemical composition as well as morphological parameters revealed that, at the beginning of the experiment, krill was in transition from winter to summer physiology, with some features typical for late winter/spring (low lipid reserves, low C:N ratio, elevated O:N ratio) and others for summer (high respiration rates, high MDH activity, large green digestive gland, short intermoult period (IMP) and fast growth). Starvation reduced body reserves drastically by more than 1% C per day. In relative terms, lipids (40%) and glycogen (30%) were reduced most and proteins by 10% of the initial value. Absolute consumption, however, was approximately 4% DM for lipids and proteins each, whereas contribution of glycogen was negligible. Within lipids, triacylglycerols (TAG) and phospholipids (PL) fell most dramatically from already low levels by 84% and 39%, respectively. Phosphatylcholine (PC) constituted 57% of PL and declined by 46%. As a result, proportions of the lipid classes changed with sterols increasing relatively. Metabolite changes were similar in cephalothorax and abdomen, although TAG in the cephalothorax fell more drastically. High metabolic activity at the beginning of starvation was quickly reduced to reach 53% after 18 days, accompanied by a reduction in the abdominal activity of malate dehydrogenase (MDH) by 25%. Our results may provide some explanation why recruitment of some year-classes of krill fails. Despite execution of the experiment in spring (i.e. transitional physiology state) and its short duration, some changes in the activity of metabolic enzymes in the abdomen, representing lipolytic, glycolytic and proteolytic pathways, respectively, were measured. Rising activities of 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase (HOAD) and glyceralaldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) indicated increased lipolytic and glycolytic fluxes, respectively, whereas declining glutamate dehydrogenase (GluDH) activity suggests reduced proteolytic flux. Activities of other enzymes from protein catabolism, alanine aminotransferase (AlaAT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AspAT), however, remained unchanged. Ratios calculated from these trends indicated a declining importance of protein use during the course of starvation compared with consumption of lipids and glycogen. These results suggest that constant-proportion enzymes from different catabolic pathways, and calculated ratios thereof, may be useful in detecting shifts between the consumption of different body reserves. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

A significant difference in lipid content was found between males I, and males II. For T. macrura, percentage of lipid content in mature animals was much higher than that in E. superba. The D.I. size distribution showed that when populations of E. superba were highly differentiated (corresponding to mature animals) in morphology, lipid content was high, and they were located near a gyre. Differences in morphometry can influence distribution of the species, because different developing stages have different swimming capacities. It is shown that, together with hydrography and trophic conditions, lipid content and morphometry of krill populations, are different but complementary aspects that help to understand krill ecology and distribution. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

The dominant krill species in the Northeast Pacific Euphausia pacifica and Thysanoessa spinifera, were compared to the two major Antarctic species, Euphausia superba and E. crystallorophias. Analysis comprised total lipid and lipid classes together with individual fatty acid and sterol composition in adults, juveniles, and larvae. Antarctic krill had much higher lipid content than their temperate relatives (10-50 and 5-20% of dry mass for Antarctic and temperate species, respectively) with significant seasonal variations observed. Phospholipids were the dominant lipid class in both temperate krill species, while neutral storage lipids (wax esters and triacylglycerols for E. crystallorophias and E. superba, respectively) were the major lipid class in Antarctic krill and accounted for up to 40% of the total lipid content. Important fatty acids, specifically 16:0, 18:1ω9, 20:5ω3, and 22:6ω3, were detected in all four krill species, with minor differences between species and seasons. Detailed lipid profiles suggest that krill alter their lipid composition with life stage and season. In particular, larval Antarctic krill appear to utilize alternate food resources (i.e., sea-ice associated organisms) during austral winter in contrast to juveniles and adults (i.e., seston and copepods). Lipid dynamics in krill among krill in both systems appear closely linked to their life cycle and environmental conditions including food availability, and can provide a more complete comparative ecology of euphausiids in these environmentally distinct systems. © 2009 Springer-Verlag.",2-s2.0-67349155314

R-cells are thought to play a role in the storage and absorption of nutrients. In fed larvae, numerous mitochondria scattered homogenously, and densely packed microvilli were observed on the apical surface of R-cells. After 5 days of starvation, mitochondria were swollen and were found concentrated in the apical region in R-cells. A decrease in cell volume and an increase in thickness of the basal lamina with many irregular infoldings were observed after 10-15 days of starvation. Lipid droplets were rarely found in the R-cells regardless of whether larvae had been fed or starved suggesting an inability to store lipid.

In this modeling approach data sets on the biochemical composition of krill and its food sources are combined into a model that takes food quality into account rather than just food availability during different seasons. Krill is defined in terms of protein, neutral lipid, polar lipid, carbohydrate, chitin, and ash content, and the model tracks krill neutral lipid content separately from weight. The model includes parameterizations of filtration, ingestion, and metabolic processes which determine krill growth rate. Initial ratios of protein, neutral lipid, polar lipid, carbohydrate and ash change in chitin response to the biochemical composition of food as krill grows. Model results show that a diet of phytoplankton food alone may be sufficient for krill to grow to observed sizes but may not be sufficient to provide the summer lipid resources that are observed in the field and that are necessary for krill to reproduce and survive winter. The inclusion of sea ice algae as an additional food is beneficial for krill at the end of winter but does not significantly change summer krill lipid content. However, the amount of lipids accumulated within krill increases significantly when krill feeds on lipid-rich heterotrophic food, which points to the importance of carnivory, even in times when phytoplankton food is available. The strategy of combusting body components to produce energy (shrinking) is found to provide the greatest source of energy for krill of all sizes during times of prolonged starvation. © Inter-Research 2008.",2-s2.0-46949098936

The sexual maturity of female and male krill exposed to LL and LD 12:12 showed an accelerated succession of external maturity stages during the experimental period, while krill exposed to continuous darkness showed no changes in external maturity during the course of the study. Changes in the maturity development of krill between the different light regimes are reflected in changes in body composition. Krill exposed to LL and LD 12:12 showed an increase in lipid utilization, indicating that the development of external maturation may be fuelled preferentially by lipid reserves. In contrast, values of total lipid content of krill held under continuous darkness indicated an unchanged lipid catabolism during the course of the study. Thus, the maturity development of krill was affected either directly or indirectly by the different simulated light conditions.

Annual harvest will double next fishing year, to more than 750,000 MT. Supplement makers love krill because of the unique composition of krill oil and the growing interest of consumers in omega-3 fatty acids. The species that are being fished heavily is the Euphausia superba. Krill oil contains phospholipids and omega-3 fatty acids eicosapentaenoic acid and decosahexaenoic acid and rich in astaxanthin which is a carotenoid pigment and powerful antioxidant. One major company working to devleop the market for krill oil is Neptune Technologies Bioressources Inc. It has used a patented cold vacuum extraction process that can yield over 3% of krill's lipid. It has started marketing its Neptune Krill Oil (NKO™) for supplement manufacturers. It has recently signed an agreement with Nestle Research Center on the study of the effects of NKO on specific chronic conditions.

Objectives were (1) to investigate the adult diet when they feed for themselves by analyzing stomach oil lipids, and (2) to compare the lipid signature of chick and adult oils. Stomach oils mainly consisted of triacylglycerols (TAG), diacylglycerol-ethers (DAGE) and wax esters (WE) (66, 14 and 11%, respectively). The dietary origin of TAG and WE was evaluated by linear discriminant analyses with fatty acid and fatty alcohol fractions. Analyses evidenced that stomach oils did not originate from Antarctic krill, but instead from myctophid fish, thus demonstrating the importance of mesopelagic fish in the nutrition of adult petrels. This result was consistent with the identification of digested remains of myctophids recovered from adult stomach contents after long foraging trips. Large amounts of a rare lipid class, DAGE (up to 76% of total lipids), were identified in two stomach oils, together with fresh remains of the squid Gonatus antarcticus (99% by mass), suggesting that DAGE could have the potential to be trophic markers of cephalopods. Moreover, six oils probably originated from Patagonian toothfish, thus confirming strong interactions between white-chinned petrels and fisheries. Comparison between chick and adult stomach oils indicated no major differences in their biochemical composition suggesting an identical dietary origin of oils, mainly myctophids. Both adult and chick oils can therefore be used to determine the feeding ecology of adult birds when they feed far away from their breeding grounds. Finally, food analysis of chick samples and adult samples collected after short and long trips indicated different foraging grounds during the two kinds of trips, and also between long trips performed in subtropical and Antarctic waters. © 2007 Springer-Verlag.",2-s2.0-34447323291

To compare the influence of herbivory and carnivory on krill we conducted a nine month feeding trial. We examined lipid composition of the hepatopancreas, abdomen and remaining body portions of krill fed diatoms at bloom condition levels, and diatoms with the addition of pellets or minced clam meat to simulate a partly carnivorous diet. Mortality, dry mass and lipid content were similar among treatments. We examined lipid class and fatty acid profiles, with emphasis placed on the ratio of storage (triacylglycerol) to structural (polar lipid) lipid and key essential omega 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids: 20:5ω3 and 22:6ω3. The triacylglycerol : polar lipid ratio increased in krill fed on the mixed diet as did the 20:5ω3 : 22:6ω3 ratio. Overall these findings indicate that provision of clam in the diet improved krill condition, and further suggest that carnivory may aid krill growth in the wild under certain environmental conditions. © Antarctic Science Ltd.",2-s2.0-34249058335

Protein recovered from whole krill had a much lower ash content than whole krill, suggesting good removal of inedible impurities (shell, appendages, etc.). Lipids were retained to a higher degree with krill protein solubilized at acidic rather than basic pH. The viscoelastic modulus (G′) showed that recovered krill protein failed to form heat-induced gel unless beef plasma protein (BPP) was added. Therefore, protease inhibitors are suggested for development of krill-derived products. Even with BPP, the G′ decreased between 45 and 55 °C. However, krill protein solubilized at acidic pH had a higher decrease of the G′ than the protein solubilized at basic pH, likely due to krill endogenous cathepsin L. Krill protein-based gels developed from protein solubilized at basic pH, especially pH 12.0, had better texture (torsion and Kramer tests and texture profile analysis) than acidic counterparts, possibly due to higher proteolysis and denaturation at acidic pH.

In order to do this, a total of six iso-protein, iso-lipid and iso-carotenoid diets were prepared. Two experimental diet series were prepared. In the first series, a control feed (K0) was compared with diets where 20%, 40% and 60% of the fish meal protein were replaced with protein from Northern krill T. inermis (K20, K40 and K60, respectively). In the second series, control feed (K0) was compared with diets where 40% of the dietary protein was replaced by protein from T. inermis (K40), Antarctic krill E. superba (AK40) and the Arctic amphipod T. libellula (AMP40). The salmon groups were fed the various diets for 160 days and the average weight of the fish increased from 410 g to around 1500 g. Fish given diets containing krill displayed a general better growth compared with the ones given pure fish meal diet. Replacing fish meal protein with protein from the crustacean sources had, in general, only minor effects on the flesh quality measured both by technical and sensory methods. However, some significant effects were noted. Postmortem muscle pH was generally lower (P < 0.05), for K20, K40, AMP40 in fish fed crustacean diets compared with those receiving the control diet. Increasing the replacement level of non-fish meal protein from Northern krill (K20, K60) significantly reduced the rigor contraction. Fish given K20 had a slightly firmer meat texture, measured as resistance to post-rigor compression, especially when compared with K60 (P < 0.05). Fish from the K20 and AMP40 groups had a deeper red flesh coloration [both light reflection (A*-value and chroma) and flesh astaxanthin concentration] than fish fed K0 and higher inclusions of krill meal. The groups with the highest astaxanthin flesh content also showed the best growth and had the highest feed intake. Finally, a sensory panel analysis differed slightly from the technical measurements in that K0, rather than K20 was given the highest score for hardness and colour. In comparison with K0, AK40 got the lowest salty taste and hardness scores from the panellists relative to the control fish (P < 0.05). Despite minor effects on the present quality measures, it is concluded that meal from three different crustacean species can successfully replace fish meal up to 60% with Northern krill, and 40% of Antarctic krill and amphipod meal of dietary proteins. © 2007 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",2-s2.0-33846222462

More than 97% of the 125 analyzed oils mainly consisted of wax esters (WEs) and triacylglycerols (TAGs) (>70% of total lipids). WE fatty alcohol (FAlc), WE fatty acid (FA), and TAG-FA profiles clearly segregated P. aeq. from P. ten., with smaller, but still significant, differences among the three other petrel species. P. aeq. and P. ten. therefore preyed on distinct prey species, whereas H. cae., P. bel., and P. des. had a more similar diet, but still with some prey differences. Comparisons between FAlc and FA patterns of oils with those of potential prey species showed that >93% of FAlc and FA patterns of oil WEs had a high probability of resemblance with the myctophid signatures, and similar results were obtained with the TAG fractions. Almost no stomach oil fit the lipid patterns of subantarctic and Antarctic euphausiids, including those of the WE-rich Thysanoessa macrura and the TAG-rich Antarctic krill Euphausia superba.

The feed produced from high inclusion levels of krill meal had lower ability to absorb lipid during vacuum coating than fish meal. Both amino acid and fatty acid compositions of the diets were fairly similar. The experiment commenced using salmon averaging 500 g and ended at a mean weight of 1500-1800 g (140 days of feeding). Moderate amounts of krill meal (20-60% of krill protein) in the diets increased growth during the first 71 days of feeding compared with the fish meal control, while no growth difference was observed during the last 69 days of feeding. This may, at least in parts, be explained by a feed-attractant function of the krill meal. Muscle dry weight and lipid concentrations were unaffected by the diet. Feed conversion rate increased with high levels of krill meal in the diets (e.g. for the last period from 0.94 in the 0% diet to 1.26 in the 100% diet). This indicates that the fish were able to compensate by eating more to maintain growth. The apparent digestibility coefficients of dry matter and protein were not influenced by diet, but both faecal moisture and lipid had a tendency to increase at the highest inclusion level (all protein from krill meal). This may be related to chitin in the krill diet that is known to decrease lipid absorption and induce diarrhoea (increased water content in faeces). Chitin was not utilized to any major extent. Welfare parameters such as blood haemoglobin, red blood cell counts, plasma protein, cholesterol, triacylglycerols and glucose levels were unaffected by diets. Clinical indicators of cellular damage (alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase) were similar indicating no diet-induced tissue damage during the trial. © 2006 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",2-s2.0-33745632378

Changes detected in whole krill were almost entirely associated with the lipid variability observed in DG.

FIV utilized mainly lipids overall, but also protein during the second half of the 12 d period. After 6 d of starvation most of the larvae lost half of their body C. Body lipid content decreased from 12.7 to 1.5% of dry mass (DM), whereas protein fell from 32.7 to 25.8% of DM. Respiration rates decreased from 1.3 to 0.7-0.8 μl O2 (mg DM)-1 h-1 in the first 3 d, after which they remained roughly constant.

Total lipid, lipid classes, fatty acids, fatty alcohols and sterols were analyzed in animals among several life stages. Lipids in seston and major copepods representing potential diets were collected from the water column and quantified to compare with krill. Stomach contents also were examined in selected adult krill to provide a visual snapshot of ingested material and comparison with lipid biomarkers. Total lipids in adult E. crystallorophias were significantly higher than adult E. superba (30.0% and 20.2% of dry weight, respectively). Wax esters were the major storage lipid in E. crystallorophias, accounting for over half (mean of 55.9%) of the total lipid in adult animals. In contrast, E. superba contained triacylglycerols as the dominant storage lipid in adults (mean of 45.5% of total lipid). Fatty acid and sterol distributions in krill showed minor differences between species and life stages. Larval krill, however, contained higher polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) than sub- and adult krill. While only trace amounts of fatty alcohols were found in E. superba, significant amounts were found in E. crystallorophias, particularly 14:0 and 16:0, which were major components of wax esters. Results for lipid classes, individual lipids, and stomach content suggest that E. superba is less dependent on stored lipid for overwintering than E. crystallorophias. E. superba are omnivorous, with copepods representing a significant dietary source for adults in winter. Furciliae of both species contain lower levels of lipid storage in winter and feed largely on detritus or organisms associated with ice. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",2-s2.0-9744253904

Overwintering survival of larvae has been linked to annual sea-ice formation and extent, as sea-ice biota may provide food when other sources are scarce in the water column. During autumn 2001, larvae were very abundant (1-19 individuals m -3), with younger stages dominant offshelf and older stages dominant on-shelf. On-shelf larvae were in better condition than offshore larvae. During autumn 2002, larvae again were abundant offshelf (0.01-110 m -3), whereas all stages were scarce on-shelf. Declining diatom and radiolarian blooms were present during autumn in both years. Average chlorophyll concentrations were low (0.10 vs. 0.22 μg l -1) in autumn and an order of magnitude lower in winter. Carbon content of larvae during autumn 2001 and 2002 (41% vs. 38% C of DW) suggested that lipid storage was moderate. The median autumn larval growth rate (0.027 mm d -1) was lower and the intermolt period (19 d) longer than reported summer values. During winter, larvae appeared to be food-limited based on the following observations: (1) the median growth rate decreased (0.00 mm d -1) and the intermolt period increased (40 d), (2) larval length-specific dry weight (DW) and % carbon and nitrogen of DW decreased, and (3) 88% of furcilia 6 did not develop to the juvenile stage, but remained at the same stage after molting. Experimental results demonstrated that some larvae could survive starvation for a month by combusting body reserves (ca. 1% decrease in DW and body C and N d -1), implying that a portion of the population was resilient to the suboptimal food supply. Although sea ice formed up to 2 months earlier in 2002, ice algae at the ice-water interface, where it is accessible to krill, was not an abundant food source in either year (0.05 vs. 0.07 μg chl l -1). In winter 2001, furcilia were commonly observed near the undersurface of sea-ice, but only rarely in 2002 until mid-September, when ice algae began to accumulate. Low gut fluorescence values also indicate that little nutrition was derived from autotrophs in winter. Instead, larvae were likely opportunistic scavengers exploiting all available food sources, including microzooplankton, benthic larvae, detritus, scarce phytoplankton and sea-ice biota. In summary, larval krill exhibited several overwintering behaviors: (1) flexible feeding, (2) flexible morphology (i.e., delayed development), (3) flexible physiology (i.e., increased intermolt period, reduced growth), (4) moderate lipid storage, and (5) ability to withstand starvation by combusting body C and N. Because most larvae did not shrink in length, this measure may not be a good indicator of the body combustion strategy. At these high latitudes, sea-ice biota may not be a primary source of food during winter, but progressively more important in spring as irradiance levels increase. Winter survivors during 2001 resulted in a significant recruitment to the juvenile size class during spring. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",2-s2.0-9744247720

Total lipid content and fatty-acid composition were determined in four Antarctic euphausiid species (Euphausia superba, E. frigida, E. triacantha, Thysanoessa macrura). There is a significant relationship between the lipid content and most of these ratios in the investigated euphausiids. Only the 16:1(n-7)/18:4(n-3) ratio exhibits no clear relationship to total lipids. Further exceptions occur in E. triacantha: the 18:1(n-9)/18:1(n-7) and the 20:5n-3)/22:6(n-3) ratios are not correlated to the lipid content in this species. There is a weaker correlation between the fatty-acid ratios and the total lipid content in E. superba larvae than in the postlarvae, indicating a stronger dietary influence on the lipids of the younger stages. We conclude that those fatty-acid ratios that strongly depend on an animal's total lipid content (particularly PUFA/SFA), are only of limited use as trophic indices, since total lipid content may vary greatly with factors (such as reproductive processes) that are unrelated to specific feeding preferences.",2-s2.0-9144243570

MDT was found to co-exist with α-tocopherol in all Antarctic samples, ranging from 2.8 to 22.3% of the total VE composition.

Both nonfeeding strategies (reduced metabolism, lipid use, or shrinkage in size) and switching to other foods (carnivory, ice algae, or detritus) have been suggested. We examined these alternatives in the southwest Lazarev Sea in autumn (April 1999), when sea ice was forming and phytoplankton was at winter concentrations. Both juveniles and adults had a very high lipid content (36% and 44% of dry mass, respectively) of which >40% was phospholipid. However, their low O:N ratios suggested that these reserves were not being used. Results from gut contents analysis and large volume incubations agreed that juveniles fed mainly on phytoplankton and adults fed on small (<3 mm) copepods. This dietary difference was supported possibly by elevated concentrations of 20:1 and 22:1 fatty acids in the adults. The feeding methods also confirmed that feeding rates were low compared with those in summer. Even when acclimated to high food concentrations, clearance and ingestion rates were <30% of summer rates. Respiration and ammonium excretion rates of freshly caught krill were 60%-80% of those in summer and declined significantly during 18 d of starvation. These findings suggest both switch feeding and energy conservation strategies, with a trend of reduced and more carnivorous feeding with ontogeny. This points to a ""compromise"" strategy for postlarvae, but there are alternative explanations. First, the krill may have reduced their feeding in an autumn transition to a nonfeeding mode, and, second, some of the population may have maintained a high feeding effort whereas the remainder was not feeding.",2-s2.0-0036073040

The total-lipid data for E. superba exhibited seasonal variations, with low lipid levels in late winter/early spring and the highest levels in autumn. Seasonal changes were most pronounced in the immature and adult specimens, increasing from about 10% lipid of dry mass to more than 40%. The fatty-acid compositions of the younger stages were dominated by 20:5(n-3), 22:6(n-3) and 16:0. These are typical phospholipid fatty acids, which are major biomembrane constituents. The phospholipid composition was similar in the older stages. With increasing storage of triacylglycerols in the lipid-rich immature and adult stages, the fatty acids 14:0, 16:0 and 18:1(n-9) prevailed, comprising about 70% of total triacylglycerol fatty acids. The trophic-marker fatty acids 16:1(n-7) and 18:4(n-3), indicating phytoplankton ingestion, were less abundant. They reflected, however, the dependence of the larvae on phytoplankton as well as the seasonal changes in algal composition. The generally close linear relationships between fatty acids and lipid suggest that the fatty-acid compositions of the collected specimens were largely independent of the respective developmental stage, season and region. The linear fit indicates that triacylglycerol accumulation started at a level of about 5% of total lipid. Considering the various overwintering scenarios under discussion, the life cycle and reproductive strategies of krill are discussed in the context of the lipid metabolism and fatty-acid composition of E. superba. Lipid production is effective enough to accumulate large energy reserves for the dark season, but E. superba does not exhibit the sophisticated biosynthetic pathways known from other Antarctic euphausiids and copepods. Although important, lipid utilisation appears to be just one of several strategies of E. superba to thrive under the extreme Antarctic conditions, and this pronounced versatility may explain the success of this species in the Southern Ocean.",2-s2.0-0034895642

The Arctic Thysanoessa inermis and the Antarctic Euphausia crystallorophias contain high levels of wax esters and higher concentrations of 18:4(n-3) and 20:5(n-3) and a lower ratio of 18:1(n-9)/(n-7) fatty acids in their neutral lipids than the Arctic Thysanoessa raschii and the Antarctic Thysanoessa macrura and Euphausia superba.

Depending on their ecological niche and trophic position, zooplankton species at high latitudes have developed a variety of reproductive strategies and energetic adaptations to cope with these extreme environmental conditions. Life-cycle strategies of the herbivorous copepods and euphausiids, which make up the major portion of polar zooplankton biomass, include seasonal vertical migration, dormancy (diapause, quiescence) and the accumulation of energy reserves. These lipid stores help to buffer the pulsed seasonal food supply, and they play an important role in fueling reproduction independent of phytoplankton. Only a smaller fraction of the lipid reserves accumulated during spring and summer are usually catabolized for metabolic maintenance during the food-limited dark season. These deposits are retained until the end of winter and allow early egg production and spawning prior to—or coinciding with—the onset of vernal primary production. It enables the new generation to make full use of the short productive season for growth and development to reach viable overwintering stages. The Antarctic krill Euphausia superba is an exception since it uses its depot lipids for metabolic maintenance during the dark season. It therefore relies on external resources (Primary production) for reproductive processes, resulting in a later spawning period as compared to the other euphausiids. Another important component of the herbivorous Antarctic zooplankton, the salps, have developed a very different reproductive strategy. They are able to switch from sexual reproduction to asexual budding (metagenesis), which allows extreme multiplication rates under favourable feeding conditions. Due to these successful adaptations, herbivores are able to build up huge stocks, in spite of the short productive period. Omnivorous and carnivorous zooplankton species, e.g., amphipods or chaetognaths, are not much constrained by the seasonality problem, but experience a more constant food supply. They show a tendency towards K strategies with a prolonged reproductive period, reduced egg numbers and increasing parental care. However, they do not exhibit such typical “polar adaptations” as developed by the herbivorous species. © 1999 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",2-s2.0-0032875991

Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) occurred in low abundances at both stations. Vertical profiles obtained with a Longhurst Hardy Plankton Recorder indicated that populations of C. acutus and R. gigas, which overwinter at depth, had completed their spring ascent and were resident in surface waters. Dry mass, carbon and lipid values were lower than found in summer but were consistent with overwintered populations. Phytoplankton concentrations were considerably higher at the oceanic station (2-3 mg chlorophyll α m-3) and increased over the time on station. In response to this, egg production of both large calanoid species and growth rates of R. gigas approached those measured in summer. Onshelf phytoplankton concentrations were lower (&lt; 1 mg m-3), and low egg production rates suggested food limitation.

Northern stations were characterized by 'high lipid-high triglyceride' content, western and eastern locations by 'high lipid-high phosphatidyl choline' content and southern areas by 'low lipid-high phosphatidyl ethanolamine/glycolipid' content.

Principal Component Analysis classified the copepods into three dietary regimes: (i) omnivores or general algal feeders under the pack ice, (ii) dinoflagellate feeders, and (iii) diatom feeders in the open ocean.

This study reports on the seasonal lipid dynamics of E. superba (25 to 56 mm) collected in the Weddell Sea in late winter/spring, summer, autumn and mid-winter. Total lipid data provide evidence of large seasonal accumulation of reserve lipids in austral summer with a mean lipid content of 28.2% of dry mass and particularly in autumn, when mean lipid levels peak with 39.2% of dry mass. After the overwintering period mean lipid contents decrease to a minimum of 10.5% of dry mass, indicating extensive utilisation of lipid reserves during winter. These data suggest that lipids contribute significantly to the overwintering success of this extremely versatile species. Lipid class analyses of spring and summer specimens (10 to 56 mm) from the Antarctic Peninsula and the Weddell Sea revealed that not only triacylglycerol, but also phosphatidylcholine may serve as important storage lipids of E. superba In the other dominant Antarctic krill species, E. crystallorophias (10 to 40 mm) and Thysanoessa macrura (10 to 27 mm), wax esters are the primary depot lipid, but phosphatidylcholine also functions as a storage lipid in these species. Phosphatidylcholine is unusual as a reserve lipid, being an essential component of biomembranes.

An analysis of the sex ratio of krill catches derived from data collected over seven summers from the Prydz Bay region showed a decrease in the proportion of males with increasing size. There was a sharp decline in numbers of male krill once they attained a length of 51 to 55 mm. Low lipid levels in reproductive male krill may be due to reproductive costs. The resulting low storage-lipid levels are accompanied by high mortality in male krill.",2-s2.0-0029659390

Following acclimation to this regime, the animals were transferred to identical supplies of the same algal food, pre-labelled with 14C bicarbonate for 16 h. Faecal pellets were collected individually in each experiment. Following transfer to the radiolabelled food, radioactivity appeared in faecal pellets after 30 min for Isochrysis and 55 min for Thalassiosira. Fitting a first-order kinetic model to the time-course of appearance of radiolabel in faecal pellets, showed that gut turnover (mean residence time of material in the gut) was rapid for krill fed on Isochrysis (turnover time = 47 min) whilst krill took longer to process Thalassiosira (turnover time = 256 min). Uptake rate of radiolabel by the two algae differed by an order of magnitude and was inversely related to cell size. Removal of the two algal species by the krill also differed when expressed as either chanages in radiolabel or biomass but overall, similar amounts of lipid were ingested from the two food sources (817 and 615 ng· ml-1 over 12 h for Isochrysis and Thalassiosira, respectively). Assimilation efficiencies for the two algae, calculated on the basis of radiolabelled and total-lipid ingestion and egestion ranged from 63 to 86%. Most of the radioactivity in the fatty acids of Isochrysis was incorporated into C18 compounds, but this distribution did not correspond to the overall mass composition of algal fatty acids. Saturates, 16:1, 18:4 and 20:5 were labelled to a lesser extent. Radiolabelled fatty acids incorporated into krill gut and somatic tissue differed in composition from the original algal fatty acid pool. In particular, there was higher activity in saturates, in 16:3 and 18:4, whilst 18:1, 18:2 and 18:3 were labelled to a lower extent in krill. Overall, fatty acids showed lower specific activity in krill than in algae, except for 16:3. The distribution of radioactivity in faecal pellets showed a character more strongly related to that of the algal food supply than that of the krill, although the high proportion of label in saturates (predominantly 16:0) was derived from the animals. Much of the ingested fatty acids were subsequently catabolised. Taking all the fatty acids, 69% appeared to be lost by this route, indicating the major importance of fatty acids as an energy source for krill. However, some individual fatty acids were conserved, for example saturates and 18:4. In the latter case, biosynthesis from 18:3 is implied. Overall, the study indicates the importance of constructing detailed budgets in understanding the character and dynamics of feeding by Zooplankton and suggests that control of grazing by quality as well as quantity of the food supply may be a crucial aspect of understanding ocean carbon cycling. © 1995.",2-s2.0-0029132343

The detailed pattern of alkenes exhibited differences within the groups and also with tissue type (krill, Euphausia superba). The origin of alkenes in Antarctic biota appeared to be either synthesis de novo or due to the condensation of smaller molecules. Formation of alkenes by the decarboxylation of fatty acids was not consistent with the hydrocarbon and fatty acid composition of Antarctic zooplankton. There was no evidence for direct assimilation of C21 and C25 alkenes by zooplankton or higher predators from their diet.

No significant difference was found between total lipid levels of E. superba reared on each of these different diets. Phaeocystis pouchetii, although deficient in a number of the essential fatty acids, is apparently an adequate food source forE. superba. The proportion of polyenoic fatty acids varied within lipid classes although there was no significant difference between levels of the long chain polyunsaturate 20:5(n-3) in the total lipid of E. superba fed on these diets. This acid was found to be less than 1% of the total lipid in Phaeocystis pouchetii compared to 37% in Phaeodactylum tricornutum.

Euphausia superba occurs in large aggregations south of the Antarctic Convergence, living in extreme climatic conditions. In the Mediterranean Sea, populations of Meganyctiphanes norvegica experience moderate seasonal variations and a stable temperature regime (13 °C). Both species release their eggs in the water column and have similar basic patterns of development. The early seasonal development of the gonads of E. superba (especially ovarian previtellogenesis) is associated with the ice-edge in spring. Egg production is strictly limited to the summer (December, January and February), but multiple spawns are then produced by individual females through a succession of short vitellogenic cycles. Both males and females undergo a sexual regression in winter when only basic activity of the gonads (gametogenesis) is maintained. Ovarian development of M. norvegica starts in January (previtellogenesis) in the Ligurian Sea before the spring bloom. Eggs are produced from February to May by successive vitellogenic cycles. Gonadal activity is reduced during summer and autumn. This timing is different from the northern populations of the species that rather spawn in spring and summer. In both species the seasonal variability in food availability is tempered by storage of carbohydrates and lipids in the fat body for subsequent yolk accumulation in the eggs. These two krill species appear to have adapted their reproductive cycle to different habitats by using the flexibility of the physiological cycles involved in gonad development, a strategy that allows them to enhance fecundity and to tune the reproductive effort with food availability for the offspring. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",2-s2.0-0001686467

The behavioral and physiological characteristics that foster this success are: (1) the ability to find concentrations of food in several types of habitat and efficiently exploit whatever food is available; (2) the close correspondence of the life cycle with seasonal cycles of food availability; and (3) a combination of physiological mechanisms that enable krill to survive the long winter period of low food availability. We evaluated the relative importance of the following four major winter-over mechanisms that have been proposed for adult krill west of the Antarctic Peninsula. The three-fold reduction in metabolic rate is the most important winter-over mechanism for these adults, although lipid utilization and shrinkage also help satisfy energy requirements in the winter. Alternate food sources did not appear to contribute significantly as a winter energy source. However, the extent, predictability and complexity of the ice cover in a region during winter may have a great influence on the relative importance of these winter-over mechanisms for different populations. Ice cover in the waters west of the Antarctic Peninsula is unpredictable and smooth surfaced when it occurs, providing the krill with little refuge from predation. In multi-year pack ice of the Weddell Sea, however, ice cover is predictable and extensive, and there is a complex undersurface that provides hiding places. In this multi-year ice, adult krill have been observed under the ice feeding, whereas west of the Antarctic Peninsula most adult krill are in the water column in the winter and are not feeding.

The first critical period occurs during development of the non-feeding stages. Release of embryos over warm deep water (250-400 m) is advantageous for these early larval stages. The geographical distribution of spawning populations combined with the observed pattern in sinking rates of embryos during development form a reproductive strategy that maximises survival of the early non-feeding stages. The first winter is the second critical period. Physiological condition of larvae and juveniles is an index of their nutritional history and ability to survive and enter the adult population the following summer. Significant differences were found in the physiological condition of larvae collected during two winters which differed primarily in the degree of ice cover. Larvae in the heavy ice winter had higher growth rates, higher condition factor and more lipid.

The relative and absolute use of C and N during early development supported the hypothesis that lipid stores were the primary catabolic substratum during development to Cl and mid-way through Cl. Both measured and calculated estimates of the C required to develop from hatching to Cl indicated that larvae developing at higher temperatures used less energy to reach the Cl stage. After metamorphosis to the Cl stage, internal C reserves continued to satisfy ≈90% of calculated C requirements of fed larvae but the availability of food during this time may be important for development of the digestive enzyme system or of efficient feeding behavior. Development, growth, survival and elemental composition of larvae that experienced delays in food availability after metamorphosis to Cl were observed at 0 and 2 °C. Results of these experiments were used to determine the point-of-no-return (PNR) and quantify the importance of energy reserves to the first feeding stage. If initial delays in food availability exceed a certain point (PNR), starved larvae cannot recover when refed and eventually die. Short delays in food availability affected the timing of development, not the ability to continue to develop, but after iong delays the larvae lost the ability to metamorphose. The PNR depends not only on the initial energy reserves of the embryo but also on the amount of energy needed to reach Cl which in turn depends on the effect of temperature on O2 consumption rates and developmental times. The PNR of 10-14 days from the food availability experiments was similar to the calculated PNR from metabolic requirements and known lipid reserves. The calculated PNR increased with increasing temperature, from 9 to 15 days within the environmental range. Despite the narrow temperature range in the Southern Ocean, both temperature and food availability will affect the survival and recruitment of the early larvae of E. superba. © 1989.",2-s2.0-0024944991

Oxygen consumption rates of known age embryos and early larvae were measured at 0 ° C and at partial pressures ranging from 90 to 0% of air saturation. Four of the five stages of embryos (single cell, multiple cell, gastrula, and limb bud) and the larval stages (Nauplius I, Nauplius II, Metanauplius, and Calyptopis 1, the first feeding stage) regulated their oxygen uptake down to 7.3 kPa. Younger stages of embryos and larvae were able to regulate oxygen uptake at lower partial pressures of oxygen than older stages. Embryos close to hatching (twitch) were not good regulators. The oxygen consumption rates of the developing embryos and larvae usually will be independent of the partial pressure of oxygen in the environment. The pattern of oxygen consumption with age was similar to that of many fish: a low respiration rate at fertilization, increasing slowly until the embryos hatch, then a sharp increase at hatching when the larvae begin to swim, with a two-fold variability between the oxygen consumption rates of larvae of the same stage and age determined in different experiments. Embryo metabolism was only 3.45% of the total metabolic demand of all the non-feeding stages. Thus, most of the lipid reserves can be passed on to the larvae for use during development to the first feeding stage. Only the larvae were used in experiments to determine the effect of temperature on oxygen consumption rates. Experimental temperatures were -1,0, and 2 ° C, spanning nearly the full range of temperatures that the larvae encounter in the environment during early development. The effect of temperature on oxygen consumption was not linear. Oxygen consumption rates for the same age or stage larvae at 0 and 2 ° C were the same, and much higher than those at -1 ° C. The metabolism-temperature response suggests that oxygen consumption rates are temperature independent for the Calyptopis 1 larvae in the surface waters, where temperatures are usually > 0 ° C during the summer when these larvae appear. © 1989.",2-s2.0-0024483373

Chromatographic analysis by silicic acid showed that krill phospholipids are mainly composed of phosphatidyl choline (PC) with phosphatidyl ethanolamine, lysoPC and oxygenated polar materials. All chromatographic fractions showed varying activity in the decomposition of methyl linoleate hydroperoxides. In order to elucidate the mechanism of peroxide degradation, the peroxide-decomposing activities of PC were compared after the following treatments: hydrogenation, partial hydrolysis and oxidation for different periods of time. With hydrogenation, peroxide-decomposing activity was lost and the browning of PC was inhibited as well. With the progress of oxidation, both the peroxide-decomposing activity and the browning of PC were enhanced. Hydrolysis of any part of PC decreased the peroxide-decomposing activity. These results suggest that oxidative degradation is necessary for phospholipids to show peroxide-decomposing activity. © 1984, The Japanese Society of Fisheries Science.

Elemental composition (C, N and P) was also determined on the specimens used in these metabolic rate measurements. The values obtained for C, N and P were 4.7 to 47.5%, 1.2 to 12.5% and 0.09 to 1.23% of dry weight, respectively. Regression analyses of metabolic rates on different measures of body weight (fresh, dry, C, N and P) were made on krill, salps and other zooplankton as arbitrarily defined groups and also on the combined groups to determine the best measure of body weight for intra- and interspecific comparison of metabolic rates. The correlations were highly significant in all regressions, although no common measure of body weight provided the best correlation for the three groups of animals. Except for the regression of ammonia excretion on C and N weight, all other regressions of metabolic rates and body weights were significantly different within these three groups. In the combined group, oxygen uptake and ammonia excretion were better correlated to C and N weights than to dry and P weights. For phosphate excretion in the combined groups, dry weight gave the best correlation. Despite these results, the choice of a particular measure of body weight was shown to be important in a comparison of the rates between krill and salps because of their widely different chemical compositions. Our results of rate measurements are compared with those of previous workers for some Antarctic zooplankton, particularly krill. Some of the previous data are in good agreement with ours, while others are not. Possible contributing factors are considered in the latter case. The ratios between the rates (O:N, N:P and O:P) fell within the general ranges reported for zooplankton from different seas. The O:N ratio was consistently low (7.0 to 19.8, by atoms) in all species, suggesting the importance of protein in their metabolic substrates. Protein-oriented metabolism was also supported by the results of C and N analyses which indicated no large deposition of lipid in these animals. From the results of metabolic rate measurements and elemental analyses, daily losses in bodily C, N and P for Antarctic zooplankton in summer were estimated as 0.4 to 2.8%, 0.6 to 2.5% and 1.3 to 19.4%, respectively. These values are approximately one order of magnitude lower than those reported for subtropical and tropical zooplankton. © 1982 Springer-Verlag.",2-s2.0-0000167562

The mortality of the starved group was similar to that of controls fed Tetra Marin and frozen copepods and less than that of controls fed a mixture of microalgae (Dunaliella and Phaeodactylum). Because of insufficient lipid storage, E. superba is hypothesized to switch from herbivorous feeding to omnivorous or carnivorous during the Antarctic winter. The present results suggest, however, that body shrinkage could be an alternative way for this animal to conserve energy during the winter.

This effect did not seem to be consistent with the high content of polyunsaturated fatty acids. By means of various chromatographic techniques and mass spectrometry, the antioxygenic material has been identified as α-tocopherol. Phospholipids, which comprised 41% of the total lipids, acted synergistically with α-tocopherol, but were not the primary antioxidants. During prolonged storage (45°C, 60 days) of krill lipids, no increase in POV was observed, as if the oxidation had been inhibited completely.

Lipid was much more variable; extreme limits of variation were from 6 to 33% dry weight, though the lipid content during January was distinctly higher than in December (means 27 and 13% dry weight respectively). This increase probably reflects a more intensive grazing by krill during the Antarctic summer. Increased lipid appears to be associated with some reduction in water content and in ash. Carbohydrate is low, the mean value for December being just under 5 % dry body weight, but the content is slightly higher than that found for most zooplankton and may reflect the herbivorous habit of E. superba. The proximate biochemical composition of krill is similar to that of the boreal euphausiid, Meganyctiphanes norvegica. © 1971, Marine Biological Association of the United Kingdom.

Phytanic acid was found to be present to the extent of 1·4% of the total fatty acids, and was isolated and identified by mass and infra‐red spectrometry. Two other isoprenoid fatty acids, pristanic acid (0·04%) and 4,8,12‐trimethyltridecanoic acid (0·05%) were detected by gas‐liquid chromatography. E. superba constitute almost exclusively the diet of whales inhabiting Antarctic waters, and the phytanic acid in whale oils is probably derived from ingested krill which presumably biosynthesise this acid from the phytol moiety of chlorophyll present in the diatoms on which these planktonic crustaceans live.
