Identifying sea-ice characteristics that serve as indicators of habitat quality will be crucial to the monitoring and management of climate change impacts. In the Southern Ocean, Antarctic krill is a key prey species and fishery target. Krill larvae depend upon sea-ice habitats to survive the winter and recruit to the population in spring. Existing observations of sea-ice characteristics lack sufficient spatiotemporal coverage to quantify which ones contribute to favourable overwintering habitat, leading to uncertainties in how current and future changes in sea ice affect krill populations. Here, we derive regional-scale indices of annual krill recruitment spanning 35 years across the southwest Atlantic. To develop meaningful indicators of sea-ice habitat, we selected variables from a high-resolution sea-ice model that are hypothesized as relevant for larval habitat use. The resulting correlations between recruitment and sea-ice indicators vary by region and show remote connections to sea ice that correspond with established theories of larval transport. Through an improved representation of sea-ice habitat quality, as compared with using more traditional satellite-derived variables such as sea-ice extent and duration, we highlight plausible regions of overwintering habitat. Our findings improve current understanding of how krill are likely responding to changing sea ice and support emerging views that larval habitat use is complex. Furthermore, regional variation in larval dependence on sea ice may provide pockets of resilience to change for the broader krill population. © 2021",2-s2.0-85109067248

Due to the challenges of working in polar marine ecosystems, most knowledge on polar zooplankton community structure is derived from summer surveys. Here we examine the spatial distribution, abundance and community structure of macrozooplankton in relation to sea-ice and ocean-climate dynamics within the Antarctic Peninsula marine ecosystem over five consecutive winters. We compare the patterns revealed during winter with historical data collected in the same region during austral summer. Hydrographic and macrozooplankton data were collected from >100 standard stations off the northern Antarctic Peninsula during summer (2003–2011) and winter (2012–2016). Using multivariate methods, the environmental drivers and geographic structuring of the macrozooplankton community during winter and summer were investigated. Eight taxa made up 90% of total macrozooplankton abundance in winter including Metridia species, post-larval and larval Euphausia superba, post-larval Thysanoessa macrura, Limacina helicina, Chaetognatha, Ostracoda and Radiozoa. Eight slightly different taxa including Calanoides acutus, Salpa thompsoni, T. macrura (post-larvae and larvae), Metridia spp., E. superba larvae, Chaetognatha, and Rhincalanus spp. made up 87% of the total abundance in summer. Macrozooplankton clustered into five groups in winter and seven groups in summer. Winter macrozooplankton structure was more spatially consistent among years compared to summer regardless of sea-ice conditions. Salinity, chlorophyll a biomass, upper mixed layer depth and time of day were most strongly correlated with the multivariate ordination in winter whereas salinity, phaeopigment biomass and year had the highest correlations for summer, indicating the importance of similar physical features in both seasons. However, the importance of time scales differed among seasons. Although environmental determinants of summer and winter macrozooplankton community structure indicate that community structure and occurrence were strongly tied to regional variability of salinity and primary productivity gradients, macrozooplankton community structure is likely much more complex than only a few hydrographic variables can explain. Cluster boundaries are likely driven by dynamic locations of currents, fronts and localized eddies in any given season or year. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",2-s2.0-85108450604

We hypothesized that sea ice provides additional benefits because it hosts fewer competitors and provides reduced predation risk for krill larvae than the water column. To test our hypothesis, zooplankton were sampled in the Weddell-Scotia Confluence Zone at the ice-water interface (0–2 m) and in the water column (0–500 m) during August–October 2013. Grazing by mesozooplankton, expressed as a percentage of the phytoplankton standing stock, was higher in the water column (1.97 ± 1.84%) than at the ice-water interface (0.08 ± 0.09%), due to a high abundance of pelagic copepods. Predation risk by carnivorous macrozooplankton, expressed as a percentage of the mesozooplankton standing stock, was significantly lower at the ice-water interface (0.83 ± 0.57%; main predators amphipods, siphonophores and ctenophores) than in the water column (4.72 ± 5.85%; main predators chaetognaths and medusae). These results emphasize the important role of sea ice as a suitable winter habitat for larval krill with fewer competitors and lower predation risk. These benefits should be taken into account when considering the response of Antarctic krill to projected declines in sea ice. Whether reduced sea-ice algal production may be compensated for by increased water column production remains unclear, but the shelter provided by sea ice would be significantly reduced or disappear, thus increasing the predation risk on krill larvae. © 2021, The Author(s).",2-s2.0-85105880522

As the Antarctic is undergoing rapid environmental change, these mechanisms are key to ecosystem-based management of the krill fishery. We analyzed the distribution and abundance of early euphausiid larvae (calyptopes I to late furciliae) from 76 plankton samples from surface to 300 m depth in the Atlantic sector in January 2011 in relation with a previous survey and published information. Thysanoessa macrura (mean density: 209 ind m−2) dominated the sampling while Euphausia superba (mean density: 13.63 ind m−2) and Euphausia frigida (mean density: 10.05 ind m−2) were also present. T. macrura density increased while E. superba experienced a high decrease respect to historical data. Clustering of stations and correspondence analysis showed that the associations of larvae and water masses are in agreement with literature reports, so the differences on the abundance of early larvae are within the observed variability and cannot be attributed to any single factor, suggesting that it is due to more subtle changes such as the stability of the water column and/or vorticity in the fronts. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",2-s2.0-85102924071

The Antarctic Peninsula has been described as a recruitment hot spot and as a potentially important source region for larval and juvenile krill dispersal. However, there has been no analysis to spatially resolve regional-scale krill population dynamics across life stages. We assessed spatiotemporal patterns in krill demography using two decades of austral summer data collected along the North and West Antarctic Peninsula since 1993. We identified persistent spatial segregation in the summer distribution of euphausiid larvae (E. superba plus other species), which were concentrated in oceanic waters along the continental slope, and E. superba recruits, which were concentrated in shelf and coastal waters. Mature females of E. superba were more abundant over the continental shelf than the slope or coast. Euphausiid larval abundance was relatively localized and weakly correlated between the North and West Antarctic Peninsula, while E. superba recruitment was generally synchronized throughout the entire region. Euphausiid larval abundance along the West Antarctic Peninsula slope explained E. superba recruitment in shelf and coastal waters the next year. Given the localized nature of krill productivity, it is critical to evaluate the connectivity between upstream and downstream areas of the Antarctic Peninsula and beyond. Krill fishery catch distributions and population projections in the context of a changing climate should account for ontogenetic habitat partitioning, regional population connectivity, and highly variable recruitment. © The Author(s) 2020.

Few winter studies exist from which to infer impacts of changing environmental conditions on the biology of krill. Here demographic and maturity patterns of krill during five winters are examined at an overwintering hotspot in the northern Antarctic Peninsula. Two different recruitment pulses were present over the 5 years of the study. A large recruitment event was evident in winter 2012, followed by cohort growth tracked through winter 2014. A recruitment event also occurred in 2015, despite lower abundance of larvae in 2013 and 2014. The recruitment pulse in 2015 was correlated with the intrusion of high salinity water, characteristic of the Weddell Sea, during a positive El Niño–Southern Oscillation phase, suggesting recruitment was driven by advection of recruits into the northern Antarctic Peninsula. Despite the inter-annual environmental variability, most female krill were in resting reproductive stages in all years. The lack of variability in female reproductive status during winter may impose a developmental constraint to earlier spawning than previously considered; the time necessary to advance from resting stages to reproductive maturity may limit the ability of krill to adapt to trends in the timing and magnitude of the spring bloom. The observed patterns of recruitment and variation in maturity stages highlight the complexity of krill population dynamics and should be considered when projecting population responses of Antarctic krill to climate-driven changes in the Southern Ocean. © 2020, This is a U.S. Government work and not under copyright protection in the US; foreign copyright protection may apply.",2-s2.0-85089187421

Successful embryonic development and hatching are key to their life cycle, but despite the rapid climatic warming seen across their main spawning areas, the effects of elevated temperatures on embryogenesis, hatching success, and nauplii malformations are unknown. We incubated 24,483 krill embryos in two independent experiments to investigate the hypothesis that temperatures exceeding 1.5°C have a negative impact on hatching success and increase the numbers of malformed nauplii. Field experiments were on krill collected from near the northern, warm limit of their range and embryos incubated soon after capture, while laboratory experiments were on embryos from krill acclimated to laboratory conditions. The hatching success of embryo batches varied enormously, from 0 to 98% (mean 27%). Both field and laboratory experiments showed that hatching success decreased markedly above 3.0°C. Our field experiments also showed an approximate doubling of the percentage of malformed nauplii at elevated temperatures, reaching 50% at 5.0°C. At 3.0°C or below, however, temperature was not the main factor driving the large variation in embryo hatching success. Our observations of highly variable and often low success of hatching to healthy nauplii suggest that indices of reproductive potential of female krill relate poorly to the subsequent production of viable krill larvae and may help to explain spatial discrepancies between the distribution of the spawning stock and larval distribution. © Copyright © 2020 Perry, Kawaguchi, Atkinson, Sailley, Tarling, Mayor, Lucas, King and Cooper.",2-s2.0-85087501321

We used data from a 4 yr winter study of krill con-dition (lipid content), diet (stable isotopes and fatty acids), and length distributions around the northern Antarctic Peninsula to examine relationships among environmental variables (annual sea-ice cover, water column chlorophyll a [chl a], and upper mixed-layer water temperature), the condition and diet of krill, and recruitment success the following year. Diet indicators (lipid content, ?15N, ?13C, and the fatty acid ratios 16:1n-7/18:4n-3 and 18:1n-9/18:1n-7) in postlarvae were consistent among years regardless of seaice cover, suggesting that post-larval krill do not rely on sea-ice resources for overwinter survival. Diet indicators in larvae were more variable and suggest that larvae may feed on sea-ice resources when they are available but can still persist in the water column when they are not. Principal component analysis between environmental variables and diet indicators showed that water-column chl a was the only variable that significantly affected diet, regardless of annual changes in sea-ice cover. Extensive winter ice in one year did not translate into successful recruitment the following year. Krill demonstrate a high degree of flexibility with respect to overwinter habitat and diet, and the degree to which sea ice is important during different times of year and at different life stages may be more complex than previously thought. © 2020 Inter-Research.

Within this sector, our first goal was to produce quantitative distribution maps of all six ontogenetic life stages of krill (eggs, nauplii plus metanauplii, calyptopes, furcilia, juveniles, and adults), based on a compilation of all available post 1970s data. Using these maps, we then examined firstly whether “hotspots” of egg production and early stage nursery occurred, and secondly whether the available habitat was partitioned between the successive life stages during the austral summer and autumn, when krill densities can be high. To address these questions, we compiled larval krill density records and extracted data spanning 41 years (1976–2016) from the existing KRILLBASE-abundance and KRILLBASE-length-frequency databases. Although adult males and females of spawning age were widely distributed, the distribution of eggs, nauplii and metanauplii indicates that spawning is most intense over the shelf and shelf slope. This contrasts with the distributions of calyptope and furcilia larvae, which were concentrated further offshore, mainly in the Southern Scotia Sea. Juveniles, however, were strongly concentrated over shelves along the Scotia Arc. Simple environmental analyses based on water depth and mean water temperature suggest that krill associate with different habitats over the course of their life cycle. From the early to late part of the austral season, juvenile distribution moves from ocean to shelf, opposite in direction to that for adults. Such habitat partitioning may reduce intraspecific competition for food, which has been suggested to occur when densities are exceptionally high during years of strong recruitment. It also prevents any potential cannibalism by adults on younger stages. Understanding the location of krill spawning and juvenile development in relation to potentially overlapping fishing activities is needed to protect the health of the south-west Atlantic sector ecosystem. © 2019 Perry et al.

We consider the importance of a range of recruitment factors using an environmentally driven model of larval development from spawning to post-larvae. Our model examines the timing of spawning, interaction with bathymetry, susceptibility to cold temperatures, temperature-driven development and the seasonal cycle of sea ice to identify those factors with the greatest impact. The model predicts that the seasonal location of sea ice is the main limiting factor for successful larval recruitment. Spawning in January leads to the greatest area of viable larval recruitment habitat. Dense sea ice cover, which we assume that adult krill do not spawn under, prevents spawning in large areas early in the breeding season (December). Nevertheless, later spawning in February, when sea ice is at a minimum, means there is often insufficient time for the larvae to reach a viable developmental stage before the sea ice advances. Meanwhile, although spawning is possible in more northerly areas throughout the breeding season, these are generally remote from winter sea ice, which is assumed to be necessary for larvae to overwinter. Interaction with bathymetry before hatching further limits suitable habitat. Over a 12 yr period, the model predicted larval re - cruitment from January spawning in all years in the Cooperation, Ross and Weddell Seas, with episodic larval recruitment in the Bransfield Strait in 9 of the 12 years. Additional understanding of the overwintering requirements of larvae, together with regional studies at higher spatial resolution, particularly in shelf regions, will better constrain the uncertainties in the model. © 2019 Inter-Research.

In contrast, the more open marginal ice zone provides a more favourable food environment for high larval krill growth rates. We found that complex under-ice habitats are, however, vital for larval krill when water column productivity is limited by light, by providing structures that offer protection from predators and to collect organic material released from the ice. The larvae feed on this sparse ice-associated food during the day. After sunset, they migrate into the water below the ice (upper 20 m) and drift away from the ice areas where they have previously fed.

However, our understanding of their overwintering diet and its variability is limited. We studied the spatio-temporal variability of the diet in 4 cohorts of AC0 krill in the Northern Weddell Sea during late winter 2013 using stomach contents, fatty acids (FAs) and bulk stable isotope analysis (BSIA). Stomach contents were dominated by diatoms in numbers and occasionally contained large volumes of copepods. Many of the prey species found in the stomachs were sea ice-associated. Our results show that the diet of overwintering AC0 krill varies significantly in space and time. Variability in stomach content composition was related to environmental factors, including chlorophyll a concentration, copepod abundance and sea-ice cover. In contrast, FA composition mainly varied between cohorts, indicating variation in the long-term diet.

The future resilience of krill to climate change depends critically on the winter survival of young krill. To survive periods of extremely low production by pelagic algae during winter, krill are assumed to rely partly on carbon produced by ice algae. The true dependency on ice algae-produced carbon, however, is so far unquantified. This confounds predictions on the future resilience of krill stocks to sea ice decline. Fatty acid (FA) analysis, bulk stable isotope analysis (BSIA), and compound-specific stable isotope analysis (CSIA) of diatom- and dinoflagellate-associated marker FAs were applied to quantify the dependency of overwintering larval, juvenile, and adult krill on ice algae-produced carbon (aIce) during winter 2013 in the Weddell-Scotia Confluence Zone. Our results demonstrate that the majority of the carbon uptake of the overwintering larval and juvenile krill originated from ice algae (up to 88% of the carbon budget), and that the dependency on ice algal carbon decreased with ontogeny, reaching < 56% of the carbon budget in adults. Spatio-temporal variability in the utilization of ice algal carbon was more pronounced in larvae and juvenile krill than in adults. Differences between aIce estimates derived from short- vs. long-term FA-specific isotopic compositions suggested that ice algae-produced carbon gained importance as the winter progressed, and might become critical at the late winter-spring transition, before the phytoplankton bloom commences. Where the sea ice season shortens, reduced availability of ice algae might possibly not be compensated by surplus phytoplankton production during wintertime. Hence, sea ice decline could seriously endanger the winter survival of recruits, and subsequently overall biomass of krill. © 2017 Kohlbach, Lange, Schaafsma, David, Vortkamp, Graeve, van Franeker, Krumpen and Flores.",2-s2.0-85030151428

The nature of this interaction is poorly understood, particularly during the critical period of winter–spring transition. To investigate the role of sea-ice and underlying water-column properties in structuring under-ice communities during late winter/early spring, we used a Surface and Under Ice Trawl to sample animals and environmental properties in the upper 2-m layer under the sea ice in the northern Weddell Sea from August to October 2013. The area of investigation was largely homogeneous in terms of hydrography and sea-ice coverage. We hypothesised that this apparent homogeneity in the physical regime was mirrored in the structure of the under-ice community. The under-ice community was numerically dominated by the copepods Stephos longipes, Ctenocalanus spp. and Calanus propinquus (altogether 67 %), and furcilia larvae of Antarctic krill Euphausia superba (30 %). In spite of the apparent homogeneity of the environment, abundance and biomass distributions at our sampling stations indicated the presence of three community types, following a geographical gradient in the investigation area: (1) high biomass, krill-dominated in the west, (2) high abundance, copepod-dominated in the east, and (3) low abundance, low biomass at the ice edge. Combined analysis with environmental data indicated that under-ice community structure was correlated with sea-ice coverage, chlorophyll a concentration, and bottom depth. The heterogeneity of the Antarctic under-ice community was probably also driven by other factors, such as advection, sea-ice drift, and seasonal progression. The response of under-ice communities to changing sea-ice habitats may thus considerably vary seasonally and regionally. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",2-s2.0-85010711337

We use outputs from a circumpolar sea ice model, together with a set of simple assumptions regarding key habitat features, to identify possible regions of larval krill habitat around Antarctica during winter. We assume that the location and suitability of habitat is determined by both food availability and three-dimensional complexity of the sea ice. A comparison of the combined area of these regions under current conditions with a warm climate scenario indicates that while total areal sea ice extent decreases, there is a consistently larger area of potential larval krill habitat under warm conditions.

Antarctic krill eggs hatch in the aphotic zone up to 1000 m depth and larvae develop on their way to the ocean surface (development ascent) and are exposed to different quality (wavelength) and quantity (irradiance) of light. Adults show a daily vertical migration pattern, moving downward during the day and upward during the night within the top 200 m of the water column. Seawater acts as a potent chromatic filter and animals have evolved different opsin photopigments to perceive photons of specific wavelengths. We have investigated the transcriptome of E. superba and, using a candidate gene approach, we identified six novel opsins. Five are r-type visual opsins: four middle-wavelength-sensitive (EsRh2, EsRh3, EsRh4 and EsRh5) and one long-wavelength-sensitive (EsRh6). Moreover, we have identified a non-visual opsin, the EsPeropsin. All these newly identified opsin genes were significantly expressed in compound eyes and brain, while only EsPeropsin and EsRh2 were clearly detected also in the abdomen. A temporal modulation in the transcription of these novel opsins was found, but statistically significant oscillations were only observed in EsRrh3 and EsPeropsin.

How krill utilize sea ice depends on several factors such as region and developmental stage. A comprehensive understanding of sea ice habitat use by krill, however, remains largely unknown. The aim of this study was to improve the understanding of the krill’s interaction with the sea ice habitat during winter/early spring by conducting large-scale sampling of the ice–water interface (0–2 m) and comparing the size and developmental stage composition of krill with the pelagic population (0–500 m). Results show that the population in the northern Weddell Sea consisted mainly of krill that were <1 year old (age class 0; AC0), and that it was comprised of multiple cohorts. Size per developmental stage differed spatially, indicating that the krill likely were advected from various origins. The size distribution of krill differed between the two depth strata sampled. Larval stages with a relatively small size (mean 7–8 mm) dominated the upper two metre layer of the water column, while larger larvae and AC0 juveniles (mean 14–15 mm) were proportionally more abundant in the 0- to 500-m stratum. Our results show that, as krill mature, their vertical distribution and utilization of the sea ice appear to change gradually. This could be the result of changes in physiology and/or behaviour, as, e.g., the krill’s energy demand and swimming capacity increase with size and age. The degree of sea ice association will have an effect on large-scale spatial distribution patterns of AC0 krill and on predictions of the consequences of sea ice decline on their survival over winter. © 2016, The Author(s).",2-s2.0-84953338948

The objective of this study was to determine whether these differing distributions result primarily from differences in spawning locations, larval development times, and transport by the Ross Sea circulation. To address this objective, Lagrangian particle tracking experiments were used to simulate the transport of larvae of Antarctic krill and crystal krill. The particle simulations showed that regions providing inputs of Antarctic krill to the Ross Sea were along the outer shelf/slope. Crystal krill transport and retention were along the shallow banks on the outer Ross Sea shelf. Particles initialized in the inner shelf off Victoria Land showed high retention in the region south and along the Terra Nova Bay polynya, with timescales consistent with development times of crystal krill. These results suggest that the cyclonic circulation over the shelf contributes significantly to the dispersion and retention of crystal krill in parts of the inner Ross Sea continental shelf that overlaps with regions with high concentrations of krill-dependent top predators. The westward circulation along the shelf break contributes to the transport and aggregation of Antarctic krill in regions where Circumpolar Deep Water is observed on the outer continental shelf and along the shelf break.

The key species Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) has evolved metabolic and behavioural seasonal rhythms to cope with these seasonal changes. We investigate the switch between a physiological less active and active period for adult krill, a rhythm which seems to be controlled by internal biological clocks. These biological clocks can be synchronized by environmental triggers such as day length and food availability. They have evolved for particular environmental regimes to synchronize predictable seasonal environmental changes with important life cycle functions of the species. In a changing environment the time when krill is metabolically active and the time of peak food availability may not overlap if krill's seasonal activity is solely determined by photoperiod (day length). This is especially true for the Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean where the spatio-temporal ice cover dynamics are changing substantially with rising average temperatures. We developed an individual-based model for krill to explore the impact of photoperiod and food availability on the growth and demographics of krill. We simulated dynamics of local krill populations (with no movement of krill assumed) along a south-north gradient for different triggers of metabolic activity and different levels of food availability below the ice. We also observed the fate of larval krill which cannot switch to low metabolism and therefore are likely to overwinter under ice. Krill could only occupy the southern end of the gradient, where algae bloom only lasts for a short time, when alternative food supply under the ice was high and metabolic activity was triggered by photoperiod. The northern distribution was limited by lack of overwintering habitat for krill larvae due to short duration of sea ice cover even for high food content under the ice. The variability of the krill's length-frequency distributions varied for different triggers of metabolic activity, but did not depend on the sea ice extent. Our findings suggest a southward shift of krill populations due to reduction in the spatial sea ice extent, which is consistent with field observations. Overall, our results highlight the importance of the explicit consideration of spatio-temporal sea ice dynamics especially for larval krill together with temporal synchronization through internal clocks, triggered by environmental factors (photoperiod and food) in adult krill for the population modelling of krill. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.",2-s2.0-84924534399

Fatty acid trophic markers showed that copepods were consistently part of krill diet, not a switch food. In open waters, both diatom and copepod consumption increased with phytoplankton abundance. Under sea ice, ingestion of diatoms became rare, whereas feeding on copepods remained constant. During winter, larvae contained high but variable proportions of diatom markers, whereas in postlarvae the role of copepods increased with krill body length. Overwintering differed according to habitat. Krill from South Georgia had lower lipid stores than those from the Bransfield Strait or Lazarev Sea. Feeding effort was much reduced in Lazarev Sea krill, whereas most individuals from the Bransfield Strait and South Georgia contained phytoplankton and seabed detritus in their stomachs. Their retention of essential body reserves indicates that krill experienced most winter hardship in the Lazarev Sea, followed by South Georgia and then Bransfield Strait. This was reflected in the delayed development from juveniles to adults in the Lazarev Sea. Circumpolar comparisons of length frequencies suggest that krill growth conditions are more favorable in the southwest Atlantic than in the Lazarev Sea or off East Antarctica because of longer phytoplankton bloom periods and rewarding access to benthic food. © 2014, by the Association for the Sciences of Limnology and Oceanography, Inc.",2-s2.0-84892762721

The transport and fate of the embryo and larva under present and modified conditions was investigated with Lagrangian particle tracking simulations. The two modeling studies were implemented using temperature and density (embryo-larva model) and circulation distributions (Lagrangian particle tracking) obtained from a high resolution version of the Regional Ocean Modeling System configured for the wAP shelf region. Additional simulations used temperature and circulation distributions obtained from simulations that were forced with increased wind speed and increased transport of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC), both projected to possibly occur with climate change in the wAP region. Simulations using present conditions showed that successful completion of the descent-ascent cycle occurred along the outer shelf and on the shelf in regions with bottom depths of 600-700. m. Estimated residence times for the shelf regions that support success of the embryo and larva were 20-30 days. Thus, krill spawned in the mid and inner shelf regions can be retained in these regions through development to the first feeding stage (calyptopis 1). Increased winds and ACC transport resulted in more onshelf transport of Circumpolar Deep Water (CDW), which increased the volume of warm (1-1.5. °C) water at depth. These conditions supported a moderate increase in success of the krill embryo and larva, but only for limited areas of the shelf where hatching depths decreased by 10-30. m (<5%) and development time to the calyptopis 1 stage decreased by 15-20%. The modified circulation conditions also supported increased advection of krill larvae into areas of the shelf that would experience the largest reduction of sea ice, especially in winter. Projected changes in wind strength and CDW transport may potentially enhance larval survival and advection onto the wAP shelf, but recruitment may be decreased by modifications to local sea ice distributions that would impede survival of Antarctic krill that overwinter on the shelf. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",2-s2.0-84883197741

A mixture of HEY and SAK also had some dietary benefits for eel larvae, enabling them to survive for up to 58 days and to grow significantly (mean BW, 2.4 mg), compared with their initial weight (mean BW, 0.2 mg) (P &lt; 0.001). Although additional nutritional improvements are needed, the present results suggest that combination diet HEY and SAK may be a good alternative to SE as an effective diet for eel larvae. © 2012 John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd.",2-s2.0-84883560802

Two survey areas were sampled focussed on Marguerite Bay in the south, and the tip of the Antarctic Peninsula in the north. Data from 177 stations showed that the highest concentrations of krill were found in the southern sampling area. Differences between areas were associated with a few large catches of one year old krill found in anomalously warm and productive waters in Marguerite Bay, and small krill catches in the less-productive, offshore waters in the north. Estimated krill density across the survey area was 3.4krillm-2, and was low compared to the long-term average of 45krillm-2 for the Elephant Island area. Overall recruitment between the two survey regions was similar, but per capita recruitment was about 60% lower than historical mean recruitment levels measured at Elephant Island since the late 1970s. Demographic patterns showed small krill concentrated near the coast, and large krill concentrated offshore on the shelf and slope all along the survey area. The offshore distribution of adult krill was delineated by the warm (~1°C), low salinity (33.8) water at 30m, suggesting that most krill were present shoreward of the southern boundary of Antarctic Circumpolar Current Front. Distributions of larvae indicated that three hotspot areas were important for the production of krill: slope areas outside Marguerite Bay and north of the South Shetland Islands, and near the coast around Antarctic Sound. Successful spawning, as inferred from larval abundance, was roughly coincident with the shelf break and not with inshore waters. Given the rapid changes in climate along the Antarctic Peninsula and the lower per capita recruitment observed in recent years, studies comparing and contrasting production, growth, and recruitment across the Peninsula will be critical to better understand how climate change will impact krill populations and their dependent predators in the Scotia Sea. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",2-s2.0-84878417362

The objective of our study was to evaluate these 2 mechanisms (remote and local inputs) and the consequences for wAP Antarctic krill populations. The relative effect of local versus remote connectivity was investigated using Lagrangian particle tracking experiments. Particles released in the Bellingshausen Sea were transported to the wAP shelf in 120 d, which is consistent with the time required for Antarctic krill eggs to develop into late-stage larvae. An estimated 23% of the particles released along the shelf break crossed the outer shelf and were transported to the mid and inner regions of the wAP shelf via 3 pathways that provide conduits for onshore intrusions of Circumpolar Deep Water (CDW). Of the particles that moved onto the wAP shelf, 54% were transported to inner shelf regions that are associated with areas of enhanced biological production. Of the particles at the outer shelf ~33% continued transport northeastward with the Antarctic Circumpolar Current. Particles released in the mid and inner shelf showed limited connectivity and low export from the shelf (<20%). The Lagrangian experiments indicate that Antarctic krill populations in the Marguerite Bay region of the wAP continental shelf are maintained by local and remote inputs of larvae.

The core data set consists of four RMT-net-sampling surveys that were conducted in early summer (December 2005 and 2007), autumn (April 2004) and winter (July to August 2006). Supplementary data were analysed from the 1980s to view the results in a wider geographical context. The major observations are the following: (1) krill abundance and distribution showed geographical, seasonal and interannual fluctuations. Krill abundance was almost one order of magnitude lower compared to the Southwest Atlantic. (2) Krill density showed substantial differences between day and night for autumn and winter surveys. (3) A spatial gradient was observed for krill size groups, with larger sized (adult spawning) krill further south and medium-sized juveniles and immatures mainly between 60° and 67°S. (4) Data on maturity stage composition and larvae occurrence indicate an active and successful spawning in these high-latitude areas even under the conditions of sea-ice cover. At the end of the spawning season, females and males regressed in their external sexual characteristics ('re-juvenation') to overwintering immature stages. Major conclusions relate to a conceptual view of the spatial distribution of krill size classes and the occurrence of larvae in the context of major oceanographic features and current systems in the Lazarev Sea and adjacent ocean sectors. The Lazarev Sea obviously does not support a single self-maintaining population, but represents a complex transition zone of stocks with different origins from the Scotia Sea and the Cosmonaut Sea. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.",2-s2.0-84864356636

We experimentally investigated the suitability of fatty acid trophic markers to elucidate the utilization of feeding habitats. Eight groups of juvenile European eels were fed on eight different diets in a freshwater recirculation system at 20°C for 56 days. Three groups were fed on freshwater diets (Rutilus rutilus, Chironomidae larvae, and Gammarus pulex) and four groups were reared on diets of a marine origin (Clupea harengus, Crangon crangon, Mysis spec., and Euphausia superba) and one on commercial pellets used in eel aquaculture. Fatty acid composition (FAC) of diets differed significantly with habitat. FAC of eel muscle tissue seemed to be rather insensitive to fatty acids supplied with diet, but the general pattern of lower n3:n6 and EPA:ARA ratios in freshwater prey organisms could be traced in the respective eels. Multivariate statistics of the fatty acid composition of the eels resulted in two distinct groups representing freshwater and marine treatments. Results further indicate the capability of selectively restraining certain fatty acids in eel, as e. g. the n3:n6 ratio in all treatments was <4, regardless of dietary n3:n6. In future studies on wild eel, these measures can be used to elucidate the utilization of feeding habitats of individual European eel. © 2011 Springer-Verlag and AWI.",2-s2.0-84857358137

However, direct observations during spring are rare. Here we studied krill body condition and maturity stage in relation to feeding (i.e. stomach fullness, diet, absorption of individual fatty acids and defecation rate) across the Scotia Sea in November 2006. The phytoplankton concentrations were low at the marginal ice zone (MIZ) in the southern Scotia Sea (Stn. 1, 2, and 3), high in open waters of the Southern Antarctic Circumpolar Current Front (SACCF) in the central Scotia Sea (Stn. 5), and moderate further north (Stn. 6 and 7). Krill had low lipid reserves (~6.5% of dry mass, DM), low mass:length ratios (~1.7mgDMmm -1), and small digestive glands (~7% of total DM) near the ice edge. The stomachs contained lithogenic particles, diatom debris, and bacterial fatty acids, but low proportions of diatom-indicating fatty acids, which suggest that these krill were feeding on detritus rather than on fresh ice algae. In the SACCF, krill had higher lipid reserves (~10% of DM), high mass:length ratios (~2.2mgDMmm -1), and large digestive glands (~16% of total DM). Stomach content and tissue composition indicate feeding on diatoms. In the north, moderate food concentrations co-occurred with low lipid reserves in krill, and moderate mass:length ratios and digestive gland sizes. Only in the phytoplankton bloom in the SACCF had the mating season already started and some females were about to spawn. Based on the way krill processed their food at the different stations, we indicate two mechanisms that can lead to fast regeneration of body reserves and oocyte maturation in E. superba. One is ""superfluous"" feeding at high food concentrations, which maximises the overall nutrient gain. The other is a preferential absorption of crucial fatty acids: 20:5(n-3) and 22:6(n-3) when regaining body condition after the winter, and 14:0 and 16:1(n-7) during accumulation of oocyte yolk. Multi-year time series of phytoplankton distribution show that an early spring bloom, as found in 2006, is not unusual for the central Scotia Sea and coincides with high krill larval concentrations in this area. In conclusion, the Scotia Sea is a main spawning ground of Antarctic krill and this is linked to phytoplankton blooms in open waters of the SACCF rather than to ice edge blooms. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.",2-s2.0-84855947024

A second aim is to clarify the extent to which seasonal variation in larval and adult krill physiology is mediated by environmental factors with a strong seasonality, such as food supply or day light. Experimental studies on adult krill have demonstrated that specific physiological adaptations during autumn and winter, such as reduced metabolic rates and feeding activity, are not caused simply by the scarcity of food, as was previously assumed. These adaptations appear to be influenced by the local light regime. The physiological functions that larval krill adopt during winter (reduced metabolism, delayed development, lipid utilisation, and variable growth rates) are, in contrast to the adults, under direct control by the available food supply. During winter, the adults often seem to have little association with sea ice (at least until early spring). The larvae, however, feed within sea ice but mainly on the grazers of the ice algal community rather than on the algae themselves. In this respect, a miss-match in timing of the occurrence of the last phytoplankton blooms in autumn and the start of the sea ice formation, as has been increasingly observed in the west Antarctic Peninsula (WAP) region, will impact larval krill development during winter in terms of food supply and consequently the krill stock in this region. © 2011 The Author(s).",2-s2.0-82255191953

This study examined the developmental toxicity of p,p'-DDE via aqueous exposure to Antarctic krill larvae. p,p'-DDE exposure was found to stimulate developmental timing in the first three larval stages of Antarctic krill, while extended monitoring of larvae after a five day exposure period had ended, revealed delayed inhibitory responses during development to the fourth larval stage. Stimulatory responses were observed from the lowest p,p'-DDE body residue tested of 10.1 ± 3.0. μmol/kg (3.2 ± 0.95 mg/kg) preserved wet weight, which is comparable to findings for temperate species and an order of magnitude lower than the exposure level found to cause sublethal behavioural effects in Antarctic krill.

E. crystallorophias had a more coastal distribution and was usually found deeper in slightly warmer and saltier water (-0.44 °C; 33.9982) than E. superba and either overlapped or was above T. macrura in depth. E. triacantha was much rarer and sporadically distributed in the study area and was found substantially deeper (center of distribution about 300. m) in the warmest saltiest water (1.40 °C; 34.65) than the other three euphausiid species. Larval distributions for E. superba indicated that at least some proportion of the populations resulted from reproduction and development on the continental shelf, and not solely from offshore reproduction and transport onto the shelf. A neutral particle tracking model was used to gain insight into the relative importance of shelf versus off-shelf origins for the larvae. The results suggest that a combination of offshore and onshore reproduction can account for the observed E. superba larval distributions in the U.S. SO GLOBEC study site. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.",2-s2.0-79955970036

However, information on growth, diet and condition during winter and early spring is limited, hampering our understanding of these fundamental biological parameters at this important period in their lifecycle. Our study assessed diet and condition of larval and postlarval krill collected from open water and below the ice off East Antarctica (110-130oE) in September/October 2007. Condition was assessed using lipid content, growth rates and digestive gland size; feeding history was assessed using fatty acid profiles and stomach content analysis; and a 207-day starvation study investigated the response of krill to long-term food deprivation. Potential food items (Calanus propinquus and sea-ice biota) were analysed for lipid and fatty acid composition to compare with krill samples. Krill were found to be in good condition, with mean growth rate of 0.95% per moult for postlarvae and 14.79% for larvae, and mean lipid content of 24.1% for postlarvae and 6.6% for larvae. Fatty acid profiles and stomach content analysis revealed two main feeding strategies - krill below the ice were feeding mostly on sea-ice diatoms, while those in open water were ingesting copepods and detritus. Krill below the ice had larger digestive glands than those in open water. Furciliae fatty acid profiles indicated a diet of heterotrophic flagellates and/or detritus. Postlarval krill survived 207 days of food deprivation by using body protein and lipid reserves for energy. In contrast, krill furciliae were severely depleted after just 5 days of food deprivation, indicating that they must feed continually at this time of year. Krill, copepods and sea-ice biota were all low in polyunsaturated fatty acids, indicating that krill must rely on later spring phytoplankton blooms to obtain these essential nutrients required for reproduction. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.",2-s2.0-79954631978

The stomach content analysis was carried out on larval and postlarval specimens ranging from 14 to 39 mm SL. Unlike larvae and juveniles of other channichthyids, which elsewhere largely rely on early life stages of Antarctic krill or ice krill, no euphausiids were found in the stomach contents of C. hamatus, except for a single large individual of Thysanoessa macrura. In both years, dietary composition consisted almost exclusively of notothenioid fish larvae. Early larvae of Pleuragramma antarcticum overwhelmingly dominated the diet in terms of abundance, biomass and frequency of occurrence, accounting for 98.4% of the index of relative importance (IRI). Other fish larvae consumed occasionally in small amount were Trematomus lepidorhinus, T. scotti and C. hamatus itself. As a result, the feeding strategy of C. hamatus was considerably shifted toward specialization, relying on relatively few taxa of prey, each of them showing a high prey-specific abundance. Comparing both dietary composition and feeding strategy of C. hamatus in the two different sampling years, several differences were observed, probably due to different environmental conditions, mainly linked to a significant delay of ice retreat and formation of the Ross Sea polynya verified in the 2003-2004 summer season. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.",2-s2.0-78751624934

Overall ex situ TS-TL relationships were: TS38 = 36.83Log TL(cm) -103.62 (N = 18); TS120 = 34.75Log TL(cm) -84.20 (N = 19); TS200 = 26.71Log TL(cm) -73.74; (N = 16). Nine in situ acoustic trawl experiments targeted at juveniles and post-larvae of P. antarcticum with a total length from 13 to 70 mm, were conducted in the southeast of the continental slope and shelf of the Ross Sea at depths from 30 to 120 m, during the Italian expeditions of 1997/98, 2000 and 2004. The regression lines for estimating TS from nine experiments were: TS38 = 57.58Log TL(cm) -123.77; TS120 = 51.94Log TL(cm) -105.92; TS200 = 46.61Log TL(cm) -95.29. These results indicate that the TS-TL relationships at 38, 120 and 200 kHz of adults of P. antarcticum differ consistently from those of post-larvae and juveniles. However, a simple model derived from the geometrical and acoustic characteristics of different parts of adult P. antarcticum and designed to ft fish life stages from adults to post-larvae and frequencies from 38 to 200 kHz, can predict the experimental TS measured both ex situ and in situ with a mean difference &lt;1.5 dB, although the differences between the predicted and measured TS at some fish lengths were high (from 7.16 to -3.14 dB). The model shows that the main contribution to the scattering for small fish is from soft tissues and for larger sizes from hard tissues (e.g. skeletal structures). This may explain why small and large fish have different TS-TL relationships. In the authors' opinion the model could be used to give a frst indication of the absolute abundance of P. antarcticum in the Ross Sea. A critical point is the decision rule to be used to differentiate P. antarcticum from Euphausia superba and E. crystallorophias that are present in the same region of the Ross Sea. Following the three-frequency decision criterion described in Azzali et al. (2004), some sizes of P. antarcticum could be confused acoustically with E. crystallorophias, but not with E. superba.",2-s2.0-78650559400

The survey progressed from 30oE in late January to 80oE in late February and was bounded in the North by 62°S. The average krill density calculated from the catches of the RMT 8 net for four geographical strata ranged from 0.84-68 individuals per 1000 m-3, with overall mean of 6.7 individuals per 1000 m-3. Krill distribution and its population structure were analysed using cluster and mixture analysis of the length frequency distribution, showing small sized krill (modal size of 25-30 mm) broadly distributed in the centre of the western area whereas middle and large sized krill (modal size of 35-45 mm and 45-55 mm, respectively) mainly distributed in the middle and eastern half of the survey area. These findings are discussed in the context of the observed geographic and oceanographic structures; the continental slope area, fronts, currents and gyres.

Krill larvae were mainly observed along the shelf break, implying the early onset of spawning in mid-November. The series of coastal polynyas developing in the early spring may be one of the important habitats allowing use of early season phytoplankton growth for early maturation and spawning, and those larvae would be transported westwards by the coastal current along the shelf slope.

Gymnoscopelus nicholsi were parasitized by both nematode species, at a prevalence of 22.7% for A. simplex C and 4.0% for A. pegreffii, while Electrona carlsbergi harbored A. simplex C at a prevalence of 9.1%. The ITS-1, 5.8S, and ITS-2 regions of the nematodes were identical to specimens from Pacific Canada or California (A. simplex C) and the coast of China (A. pegreffii), confirming an extensive range of distribution for both species. The occurrence in migrating myctophids coupled with rare findings from other teleosts leads to the conclusion that both species were introduced from outside the Antarctic. Consequently, they are at their most southern range in the Southern Ocean, and an earlier molecular record of A. simplex C from the elephant seal Mirounga leonina may have detected an accidental case of infection. Delphinids, which frequently occur along South America but not in the Southern Ocean, are suggested as being the typical final hosts in the life cycles of A. simplex C and A. pegreffii. The myctophids had only few prey items within their stomachs, dominated by euphausiids, including Euphausia superba and planktonic copepods. These are common intermediate hosts for anisakid nematodes and are an important component of the Antarctic food web. Regular introduction events through migrating whales and myctophids are considered responsible for the occurrence of Anisakis infection in the high Antarctic. © Inter-Research 2010.",2-s2.0-77954107079

The dominant krill species in the Northeast Pacific Euphausia pacifica and Thysanoessa spinifera, were compared to the two major Antarctic species, Euphausia superba and E. crystallorophias. Analysis comprised total lipid and lipid classes together with individual fatty acid and sterol composition in adults, juveniles, and larvae. Antarctic krill had much higher lipid content than their temperate relatives (10-50 and 5-20% of dry mass for Antarctic and temperate species, respectively) with significant seasonal variations observed. Phospholipids were the dominant lipid class in both temperate krill species, while neutral storage lipids (wax esters and triacylglycerols for E. crystallorophias and E. superba, respectively) were the major lipid class in Antarctic krill and accounted for up to 40% of the total lipid content. Important fatty acids, specifically 16:0, 18:1ω9, 20:5ω3, and 22:6ω3, were detected in all four krill species, with minor differences between species and seasons. Detailed lipid profiles suggest that krill alter their lipid composition with life stage and season. In particular, larval Antarctic krill appear to utilize alternate food resources (i.e., sea-ice associated organisms) during austral winter in contrast to juveniles and adults (i.e., seston and copepods). Lipid dynamics in krill among krill in both systems appear closely linked to their life cycle and environmental conditions including food availability, and can provide a more complete comparative ecology of euphausiids in these environmentally distinct systems. © 2009 Springer-Verlag.",2-s2.0-67349155314

Recently, circumpolar krill databases, combined with growth models and revisions in acoustics have made it possible to refine previous estimates. Net-based databases of density and length frequency (KRILLBASE) yield a summer distributional range of ∼19×10 6km 2 and a mean total abundance of 8×10 14 post-larvae with biomass of 379 million tonnes (Mt). These values are based on a standardised net sampling method but they average over the period 1926-2004, during which krill abundance has fluctuated. To estimate krill biomass at the end of last century we combined the KRILLBASE map of relative krill density around Antarctica with an acoustics-derived biomass estimate of 37.3Mt derived for the Scotia Sea area in 2000 by the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR). Thus the CCAMLR 2000 survey area contains 28% of the total stock, with total biomass of ∼133Mt in January-February 2000. Gross postlarval production is estimated conservatively at 342-536Mtyr -1, based on three independent methods. These are high values, within the upper range of recent estimates, but consistent with the concept of high energy throughput for a species of this size. The similarity between the three production estimates reflects a broad agreement between the three growth models used, plus the fact that, for a given population size, production is relatively insensitive to the size distribution of krill at the start of the growth season. These production values lie within the envelope of what can be supported from the Southern Ocean primary production system and what is required to support an estimated predator consumption of 128-470Mtyr -1. Given the range of recent acoustics estimates, plus the need for precautionary management of the developing krill fishery, our net-based data provide an alternative estimate of total krill biomass. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.",2-s2.0-77951497935

R-cells are thought to play a role in the storage and absorption of nutrients. In fed larvae, numerous mitochondria scattered homogenously, and densely packed microvilli were observed on the apical surface of R-cells. After 5 days of starvation, mitochondria were swollen and were found concentrated in the apical region in R-cells. A decrease in cell volume and an increase in thickness of the basal lamina with many irregular infoldings were observed after 10-15 days of starvation. Lipid droplets were rarely found in the R-cells regardless of whether larvae had been fed or starved suggesting an inability to store lipid.

The condition of larvae was quantified in both seasons by determining their body length (BL), dry weight (DW), elemental and biochemical composition, stomach content analysis, and rates of metabolism and growth. Overall the larvae in autumn were in better condition under the ice than in open water, and for those under the ice, condition decreased from autumn to winter. Thus, growth rates of furcilia larvae in open water in autumn were similar to winter values under the ice (mean, 0.008 mm d″1), whereas autumn under-ice values were higher (0.015 mm d-1). Equivalent larval stages in winter had up to 30% shorter BL and 70% lower DW than in autumn. Mean respiration rates of winter larvae were 43% lower than of autumn larvae. However, their ammonium excretion rates doubled in winter from 0.03 to 0.06 μg NH4 DW-1 h-1, resulting in mean O:N ratios of 46 in autumn and 15 in winter. Thus, differing metabolic substrates were used between autumn and winter, which supports a degree of flexibility for overwintering of larval krill. The larvae were eating small copepods (Oithona spp.) and protozoans, as well as autotrophic food under the ice. The interplay between under-ice topography, apparent current speed under sea ice, and the swimming ability of larval krill is probably critical to whether larval krill can maintain position and exploit suitable feeding areas under the ice. © 2009, by the American Society of Limnology and Oceanography, Inc.",2-s2.0-67949090996

The larval species community clustered in a diverse coastal community with high densities of Antarctic silverfish Pleuragramma antarcticum larvae and a less diverse offshore community dominated by Antarctic jonasfish Notolepis coatsi and the lanternfish Electrona antarctica. No postlarval fish were caught in coastal areas. The offshore community of postlarval fishes consisted of the deep-sea smelt Bathylagus antarcticus, and the lanternfishes Gymnoscopelus braueri, C. nicholsi and E. antarctica.

Mean energy density of E. antarctica in the upper 200 m was 2.8 kJ m-2, which is equivalent to 36% of the energy stored in Antarctic krill stocks and probably would be considerably higher if a greater depth range were considered.

Stratified (BIONESS) biological sampling at five depth-ranges and CTD casts were performed at 40 stations, including a cross-Strait transect. Six families, 11 genera and 16 species composed the total catch of larval and juvenile fish, which were more abundant in the upper 75 m. Trematomus scotti was the most abundant fish and large individuals dominated at depths >75 m. The fish distribution patterns were associated with the main water masses in the area and with bottom depth. Spatial segregation in density and biomass of krill (Euphausia superba) and salps (Salpa thompsoni) was observed at a relatively small scale, in relation to the main water masses. Also, size-related spatial segregation was found in krill. The present study suggests that the spatial distribution of krill, salps and early life stages of fish, are influenced by the main water masses in the Strait, and that species may adapt their reproductive strategies not only to seasonal production peaks, but to transport processes within water bodies that maximise their fitness through optimum temperature and/or trophic environments. © 2008 Springer-Verlag.",2-s2.0-42249107141

A primary goal of the Southern Ocean GLOBEC program was to describe factors that contribute to the overwintering success of krill in this region. As part of this effort we conducted Video Plankton Recorder (VPR) surveys during austral fall and winter, 2001. The VPR survey yielded high-resolution distributions of larval krill, other plankton, and marine snow in relation to hydrography from a series of transect lines orthogonal to the coast on the continental shelf of the Western Antarctic Peninsula. Four taxa (larval krill, copepods, polychaetes, pteropods) and marine snow were numerous during fall; much lower abundances of all categories were present during winter, with only larval krill, copepods, and polychaetes present in any abundance. Distributions of plankton and marine snow were associated with water-mass types and the vertical structure of the environment, particularly for larval krill that were primarily associated with the pycnocline. During fall, larval krill were present across the entire shelf, with high abundances at the shelf break. Copepods were most numerous at depth during fall, consistent with ontogenetic migration to depth at the onset of winter. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",2-s2.0-40249097397

We investigated whether reproduction and early larval development are the cause of local recruitment failure. It was found that the majority of adult females were reproductively active in summer and that there was a comparatively high investment in the ovary, reaching up to 46 % of the total wet weight of the krill. The corresponding egg batches were amongst the largest ever reported for E. superba. A semi-empirical model predicted that 11 % of females completed just 1 spawning episode per year, 60 % completed 2, and 29 % completed 3 or more. On average, a South Georgian krill released 12 343 eggs yr-1. The eggs were unable to complete the descent-ascent developmental cycle on-shelf because the bathymetry was too shallow but, off-shelf, they were predicted to sink to between 490 and 520 m and return to the surface either as a metanauplius or 1st calyptopis stage with plenty of energy reserves remaining. Feeding conditions were adequate for the development of later larval stages once these reserves were exhausted. Although net surveys found calyptopis and early stage furcilia in the vicinity of South Georgia, numbers were mostly lower than predicted. Overall, reproduction or early stage development are successful in this region, leaving predation on larvae and advective export during winter as the main potential causes of local recruitment failure. © Inter-Research 2007.",2-s2.0-33947109411

The experiments showed furcilia to have much higher grazing rates on copepods and ciliates than on algae, with positive selection for ciliates that was not influenced by the presence or absence of O. similis. M. gerlachei had a grazing impact on ciliates that was much less than that of furcilia larvae, but due to a high taxonomic resolution of the ciliate community it could be shown that there were groups of grazing-vulnerable and -resistant forms. Contrary to expectations, O. similis had very low grazing rates on both ciliates and algae, but here too grazing-vulnerable and -resistant groups of ciliates could be distinguished. Neither the very strong impact of furcilia on ciliates, copepods and algae nor the more moderate impact of M. gerlachei cascaded down to heterotrophic and phototrophic nanoplankton or to bacteria.

Using DNA as a marker molecule, our goal in this study has been to evaluate the efficacy of a PCR-DGGE (denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis) approach targeting the 18S rDNA gene to discriminate among diet constituents in gut and fecal pellet samples from young Antarctic krill relative to their feeding environment - the seawater and sea ice microbial community. We conducted 2 laboratory-based feeding experiments with known food items and 3 field samplings of both the krill and their feeding environment. Sequenced PCR-DGGE phylotypes from laboratory trials clearly distinguished diatom and copepod prey, while in situ feeding analyses revealed that a broad diversity of taxa were ingested, including diatoms (Bacillariophyta, the most prevalent group detected), dinoflagellates, cryptomonads, prasinophytes, ciliates, cercozoans, choanoflagellates, turbellarians and (possibly) sponge larvae. Band image analyses allowed environmental and diet phylotypes to be matched. On average, 32 % of those from the environment were present in the diet; conversely, of the phylotypes detected in the diet, an average of 59 % were in common with the environment.

Zooplankton densities were lowest on 22-28 November (ave=61 individuals (ind) m-3), when almost the entire transect was covered by sea ice.

Total densities declined on each subsequent transect, returning to an average of 169 ind m-3 on 10-11 March. The seasonal density decline was due to the decline in densities of ""Peak Community"" taxa, but coincided with the rise of Euphausia superba larvae into the surface waters, increased densities of Salpa thompsoni, and an increased contribution of C4 to adult stages to the populations of Calanoides acutus, Calanus propinquus and Calanus simillimus. The seasonal community succession appeared to be influenced by the low sea ice extent and southward projection of the ACC in this region. The relatively warm ACC waters, together with low krill biomass, favoured high densities of small grazers during the January/February bloom conditions. The persistence of relatively warm surface waters in March and the seasonal decrease in chlorophyll a biomass provided favorable conditions for salps, which were able to penetrate south of the Southern Boundary. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

From 25 February to 3 March 2002 a 2150-km Continuous Plankton Recorder (CPR) transect was conducted along 140°E, between 47.02°S and 66.36°S, crossing each of these frontal zones. Surface temperature, salinity, and fluorescence were measured at 1-min intervals in conjunction with CPR samples. Additional physical data for the region south of 61oS was provided by nine CTD stations. Multivariate and Indicator Species analysis of the high resolution (∼9.2 km) zooplankton samples identified six distinct assemblages which were strongly correlated with frontal/oceanographic zones. These assemblages appeared to be structured by a combination of zonal differences in water mass structure, phytoplankton regimes, and small scale intra-zonal features (e.g. eddies). The northern branch of the SAF was the strongest biogeographic boundary, separating a high proportion of sub-tropical and temperate species from the waters to its south. The study area differed from other sectors of the Southern Ocean in that the northern PF, equivalent to the PF in other sectors, was not a zone of distinct ecological transition. Two of the identified assemblages were located with the seasonal ice zone, south of the northern SACCF. Although Euphausia superba larvae were a component of both of these assemblages, this species, together with appendicularia, was most abundant south of the SB. The seasonal ice zone north of the SB was dominated by small copepods (Oithona similis and Ctenocalanus citer), appendicularia and foraminifera.

FIV utilized mainly lipids overall, but also protein during the second half of the 12 d period. After 6 d of starvation most of the larvae lost half of their body C. Body lipid content decreased from 12.7 to 1.5% of dry mass (DM), whereas protein fell from 32.7 to 25.8% of DM. Respiration rates decreased from 1.3 to 0.7-0.8 μl O2 (mg DM)-1 h-1 in the first 3 d, after which they remained roughly constant.

To examine spatial and temporal changes over larger scales, we have combined all available scientific net sampling data from 1926 to 2003. This database shows that the productive southwest Atlantic sector contains >50% of Southern Ocean krill stocks, but here their density has declined since the 1970s. Spatially, within their habitat, summer krill density correlates positively with chlorophyll concentrations. Temporally, within the southwest Atlantic, summer krill densities correlate positively with sea-ice extent the previous winter. Summer food and the extent of winter sea ice are thus key factors in the high krill densities observed in the southwest Atlantic Ocean. Krill need the summer phytoplankton blooms of this sector, where winters of extensive sea ice mean plentiful winter food from ice algae, promoting larval recruitment and replenishing the stock. Salps, by contrast, occupy the extensive lower-productivity regions of the Southern Ocean and tolerate warmer water than krill.

During the southern ocean global ecosystem dynamics (SO GLOBEC) research cruise in July/August 2001 aboard the ARSV Laurence M. Gould west of Adelaide Island and Marguerite Bay, larval krill were observed in the under-ice habitat. Ten instantaneous growth rate experiments were conducted with larvae collected from the under-ice habitat on the outer shelf, mid-shelf, and just south of Adelaide Island in the mouth of Marguerite Bay. For all experiments, average growth increments for larval krill were about -1.6% per intermolt period, with a median intermolt period of 30.6 d. Larvae were observed feeding on the ice, even though no color was visible in the ice. Pigment (chlorophyll a equivalents) content of larvae from three of the sites was measured as an indicator of ingestion of sea-ice microalgae. Pigment values were above those found in starved controls, but only about 20% of maximum possible values. Although feeding, the data suggested that the larval krill were unable to ingest enough food to maintain growth. The results from this first SO GLOBEC winter process cruise were compared to growth rates of larval krill during previous winter cruises that covered all months from late May through September, except for the month of August. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper examines in situ feeding cycles, ingestion rates and growth of larval krill Euphausia superba. Larval krill were exceptionally numerous, especially over the shelf break and continental slope: mean 8872 larvae m -2, maximum 30 084 larvae m -2. The developmental stage composition of krill larvae over the shelf was advanced compared to that at continental slope stations, which may have resulted from enhanced food availability over the shelf. Despite the season being late autumn, the feeding activity of larval krill was similar to published summer rates. The intermoult period of larval krill ranged from 6 to 17 days, with daily growth rates reaching 2.2% of body length, 8.7% of body wet mass and 5.7% of body carbon. Daily ingestion rates were 8.5-17.6 μg C ind -1 d -1 for calyptopis 3 to furcilia 2 and 35.1-57.4 μg C ind -1 d -1 for furcilia 3-5, and were positively correlated with ambient chlorophyll a concentrations. Daily rations showed the same tendency, ranging from 21.5 to 44.5% of body C d -1 (calyptopis 3 to furcilia 2) and from 17.8 to 29.2% of body C d -1 (furcilia 3-5). Comparison of daily rations between open water and sea ice stations supports the notion that larval krill at low pelagic food supply under the sea ice have to exploit ice biota to sustain their metabolic demands. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

Overwintering survival of larvae has been linked to annual sea-ice formation and extent, as sea-ice biota may provide food when other sources are scarce in the water column. During autumn 2001, larvae were very abundant (1-19 individuals m -3), with younger stages dominant offshelf and older stages dominant on-shelf. On-shelf larvae were in better condition than offshore larvae. During autumn 2002, larvae again were abundant offshelf (0.01-110 m -3), whereas all stages were scarce on-shelf. Declining diatom and radiolarian blooms were present during autumn in both years. Average chlorophyll concentrations were low (0.10 vs. 0.22 μg l -1) in autumn and an order of magnitude lower in winter. Carbon content of larvae during autumn 2001 and 2002 (41% vs. 38% C of DW) suggested that lipid storage was moderate. The median autumn larval growth rate (0.027 mm d -1) was lower and the intermolt period (19 d) longer than reported summer values. During winter, larvae appeared to be food-limited based on the following observations: (1) the median growth rate decreased (0.00 mm d -1) and the intermolt period increased (40 d), (2) larval length-specific dry weight (DW) and % carbon and nitrogen of DW decreased, and (3) 88% of furcilia 6 did not develop to the juvenile stage, but remained at the same stage after molting. Experimental results demonstrated that some larvae could survive starvation for a month by combusting body reserves (ca. 1% decrease in DW and body C and N d -1), implying that a portion of the population was resilient to the suboptimal food supply. Although sea ice formed up to 2 months earlier in 2002, ice algae at the ice-water interface, where it is accessible to krill, was not an abundant food source in either year (0.05 vs. 0.07 μg chl l -1). In winter 2001, furcilia were commonly observed near the undersurface of sea-ice, but only rarely in 2002 until mid-September, when ice algae began to accumulate. Low gut fluorescence values also indicate that little nutrition was derived from autotrophs in winter. Instead, larvae were likely opportunistic scavengers exploiting all available food sources, including microzooplankton, benthic larvae, detritus, scarce phytoplankton and sea-ice biota. In summary, larval krill exhibited several overwintering behaviors: (1) flexible feeding, (2) flexible morphology (i.e., delayed development), (3) flexible physiology (i.e., increased intermolt period, reduced growth), (4) moderate lipid storage, and (5) ability to withstand starvation by combusting body C and N. Because most larvae did not shrink in length, this measure may not be a good indicator of the body combustion strategy. At these high latitudes, sea-ice biota may not be a primary source of food during winter, but progressively more important in spring as irradiance levels increase. Winter survivors during 2001 resulted in a significant recruitment to the juvenile size class during spring. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",2-s2.0-9744247720

Total lipid content and fatty-acid composition were determined in four Antarctic euphausiid species (Euphausia superba, E. frigida, E. triacantha, Thysanoessa macrura). There is a significant relationship between the lipid content and most of these ratios in the investigated euphausiids. Only the 16:1(n-7)/18:4(n-3) ratio exhibits no clear relationship to total lipids. Further exceptions occur in E. triacantha: the 18:1(n-9)/18:1(n-7) and the 20:5n-3)/22:6(n-3) ratios are not correlated to the lipid content in this species. There is a weaker correlation between the fatty-acid ratios and the total lipid content in E. superba larvae than in the postlarvae, indicating a stronger dietary influence on the lipids of the younger stages. We conclude that those fatty-acid ratios that strongly depend on an animal's total lipid content (particularly PUFA/SFA), are only of limited use as trophic indices, since total lipid content may vary greatly with factors (such as reproductive processes) that are unrelated to specific feeding preferences.",2-s2.0-9144243570

All experiments were carried out during fall and winter months (April through September) on nine separate cruises west of the Antarctic Peninsula between 1987 and 1999. A consistent seasonal pattern across years was observed: growth rates decreased during fall (April/ May), were minimal in early winter (June), and increased to maximum rates by late winter (September). Habitat-specific differences (water column vs under-ice) in growth rates of larvae collected on the same cruise were not observed in early winter (June 1993; within-year comparison). However, in a between-year comparison, larvae from the under-ice habitat (June/July 1987) had significantly higher growth increments than larvae from the open-water habitat (July 1989). The difference between these two comparisons may be a function of the degree of contrast in food availability in the water column and the sea ice at different times in the winter. Daylength at the time of collection explained 74% of the variation in larval and juvenile growth rates.

The data were from a series of 11 cruises, 1 in spring (November 1991) and 10 in summer (January 1993 to January 2002). A maximum-likelihood fitting procedure was used to fit a mixture of normal distributions to the length-density distributions derived from net data. The recruitment index was calculated as the proportion of age-class 1 krill of the total. Antarctic krill in the Palmer LTER region showed a pattern of episodic recruitment, with 2 strong year classes in succession followed by 3 or 4 moderate or poor year classes. The 2 strong year classes represented 85 to 90% of the krill caught for 5 or 6 yr, and as the absolute abundance of the year class declined due to mortality, so did the abundance of Antarctic krill in the region. The recruitment index was positively correlated with the absolute value of a seasonal El Niño/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) index, with strongest recruitment during the neutral or moderate periods of ENSO.

A dense phytoplankton bloom (5 to 25 μg chl a l-1) occupied the mixed layer throughout the study period. The feeding of larvae was measured by incubating the animals in natural seawater. Food concentrations ranged from 102 to 518 μg C l-1 across experiments, and the mean daily C rations were 28% body C for calyptosis stage III (CIII), 25% for furcilia stage I (FI) and 15% for FII. The phytoplankton, dominated by diatoms and motile prey taxa, ranged from 8 to 79 μm in size. Across this size spectrum of diatoms, CIII cleared small cells most efficiently, as did FI to a lesser degree. FII, however, showed no clear tendency for a specific cell size. Across the measured size spectrum of the motile taxa, all larvae stages showed a clear preference towards the larger cells. Estimated C assimilation efficiencies were high, from 70 to 92% (mean 84%). Respiration rates of freshly caught larvae were 0.7 to 1.1 μl O2 mg DM -1 h-1. The calculated respiratory C loss showed a significant increase with increasing food concentration in all larval stages, ranging from 0.9 to 2.4% body C d-1.

Critical concentrations of food to achieve maximum daily rations were in the range of 100 to 200 μg C l-1 (∼2 to 4 μg chl a l-1).

Inputs to the model are monthly mean climatologies of ambient temperature and density fields obtained from the World Ocean Atlas Database for Southern Ocean waters. Simulations are done with a 1° resolution at a circumpolar scale, south of 60°S, and the results are interpolated to a 5′ grid to match the resolution of the bottom bathymetry data. Simulations of the descent-ascent cycle using environmental conditions corresponding to the Antarctic krill spawning season (December-March) resulted in unconstrained success in completion of the cycle in water deeper than 1000 m. Continental shelf regions favorable to successful hatching of Antarctic krill embryos are limited to areas along the west Antarctic Peninsula, large areas in the Bellingshausen and Amundsen Seas, offshore of Wilkes Land, and to the east and west of Prydz Bay. These are regions where the Southern Antarctic Circumpolar Current Front is along the shelf slope, the Antarctic Slope Front is absent, and Circumpolar Deep Water is present. The effect of seasonal variability in temperature on the descent-ascent cycle tends to enhance the probability of success in regions offshore of Wilkes Land, Queen Maud Land, and the eastern shelf of the Antarctic Peninsula later in the spawning season. The simulations show that success of the descent-ascent cycle is sensitive to initial embryo diameter and larval ascent rate. Initial embryo diameter may provide an additional constraint on success of the descent-ascent cycle, especially in continental shelf waters, where small embryos tend to encounter the bottom before hatching. The circumpolar distributions of simulated embryo hatching depth and larval success show that all regions of the Antarctic are not equal in the ability to support successful completion of the Antarctic krill descent-ascent cycle, which has implications for the overall circum-Antarctic krill distribution and for the development of nutrient and material budgets, especially for Antarctic continental shelf areas. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

We examined the δ15N and δ13C values of Antarctic euphausiids and copepods from the Polar Front, Lazarev Sea, and Marguerite Bay against their foodweb baseline of particulate organic matter (POM). Interpretations of trophic level were helped by comparison with other approaches and by calibration experiments with Euphausia superba fed known diets. Results for well-known mesozooplankters (e.g., Calanoides acutus and Metridia gerlachei) were internally consistent and corresponded to those derived from independent methods. This gave confidence in the isotope approach for copepods and probably larval euphausiids. Among the dominant yet poorly known species, it suggested mainly herbivory for Rhincalanus gigas but omnivory for Calanus simillimus and furcilia larvae of Thysanoessa spp. and Euphausia frigida. The δ15N values of adult copepods were up to 3‰ higher than those of early copepodites, pointing to ontogenetic shifts in diet. In the Lazarev Sea in autumn, the isotopic signals of E. superba larvae suggested pelagic, mainly herbivorous, feeding rather than feeding within the ice. In contrast to the mesozooplankton, some anomalous results for postlarval krill species indicated problems with this method for micronekton. The experiments showed that postlarval E. superba did not equilibriate with a new diet within 30 d. We suggest that the slower turnover of these larger species, partly in combination with their ability to migrate, has confounded trophic effects with those of a temporally/spatially changing food-web baseline. Interpretations of food sources of micronekton could be helped by analyzing their molts or fecal pellets, which responded faster to a new diet.",2-s2.0-0037252082

Larval abundances were estimated from net catches and compared directly to visual counts (made by a SCUBA diver) of larvae occupying the ice habitat at the same sampling stations. The number of larvae per square meter sampled with nets was more often greater than that observed by the diver, irrespective of the sampling period. However, comparisons of larval abundance within sampling periods were not statistically significant. Larval krill collected by divers were significantly larger than those collected with nets for each of the three cruises. The stage composition of larval krill also depended on the collection method: net-collected samples contained a disproportionately high number of early furcilia larvae in June 1993 (early winter), and a disproportionately low number of early juveniles during September 1991 and 1993 (late winter). These results lead us to suggest that larval/juvenile krill occupy both the water column and sea ice habitat during the austral winter, and that there are often differences in the sizes and developmental stages of the two groups. For larval krill that occupied the sea ice habitat, aggregations were larger and more numerous during late winter than in early winter. In addition, larvae within aggregations occupied structurally complex microhabitats, provided by over-rafted ice floes, more often than they occupied smooth, downward-facing ice surfaces where ice was not over-rafted.",2-s2.0-0036801672

Given the fact that the xenobiotics detected in polar ecosystems are persistent and toxic, investigating the presence of these chemicals in a pristine environment such as Antarctica has become a priority. In specimens of the most important key species of Antarctic marine food web, Euphausia superba and Pleuragramma antarcticum sampled in the Ross Sea, we evaluated concentrations of the following persistent organic pollutants: polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), chlorinated pesticides such as hexachlorobenzene (HCB), and p,p′-DDE. Sampling was carried out in the framework of the Italian National Program for Research in Antarctica (PNRA) from 1999 to 2000. PCB concentrations were higher than HCB and p,p′-DDE by two orders of magnitude; levels of HCB and p,p′-DDE, in the range of 1-5 ng/g wet weight, were low compared to those reported for species in lower latitude marine environments. PCBs values were comparable to those determined in moderately contaminated areas. PCB fingerprints and patterns of isomer classes showed a predominance of low-chlorinated PCBs: tri-, tetra- and penta-CB congeners constituted more than 50% of the total residue in krill and larvae and less than 50% in adult silverfish. The pattern seems common to that of Kanechlor, a technical mixture used mostly in Japan and other Eastern Asian countries that are roughly at the same longitude of the Ross Sea. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

The composition of the mesozooplankton populations varied in space and with season. Copepods always dominated in number and biomass, but salps and pteropods were present in the northern part of the transect in summer. Five species of large copepod (Calanus simillimus, Calanoides acutus, Rhincalanus gigas, Calanus propinquus and Metridia gerlachei) dominated the biomass with a North-South gradient. Smaller species (Oithona spp., Ctenocalanus citer, Clausocalanus laticeps) were also present. Biomass showed a definite trend with highest levels towards the polar front zone and permanent open-ocean area. Feeding activity was monitored either for the total population (summer) or specific individuals (spring). In summer, depending on the area considered, grazing rates by mesozooplankton appeared to have a significant impact on phytoplankton primary production. In the northern part of the transect (polar front zone or PFZ), salps and to a minor extent pteropods and copepods contributed mostly to the feeding pressure. Maximum intensity was observed in the Coastal Antarctic Zone (CCSZ) where Euphausia superba (adults and calyptopis larvae) could ingest more than 100% of the daily primary production. In spring, the impact of copepods dominated the zooplankton community. Small calanoids and young stages of large species of copepods rather than adult stages were the dominant contributors to grazing pressure. In summer, respiration rates of the dominant copepod species showed that energy expenditure exceeded by far chlorophyll ingestion. This is generally interpreted as the consequence of ingestion of alternate non-chlorophyll food source. The inverse correlation between the biomass of microzooplankton and the area of maximum difference between grazing and respiration confirmed that in summer the protozoans are strongly controlled by the copepod community. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The hyperiid amphipod Themisto gaudichaudii was consistently the dominant prey item, accounting for 76 and 70% by number, and 57 and 57% by reconstituted mass of the diet of P. belcheri and P. desolata, respectively.

P. desolata also caught more small prey such as copepods (9 vs <1% by number) and cypris larvae of Lepas australis (8 vs 3% by number) than P. belcheri, which can be related to the beak filtering apparatus present only in the former species. Biogeography of the prey and their state of digestion indicate that prions foraged in a wide variety of marine habitats, including the kelp belt, kelp rafts, and coastal, neritic and oceanic waters. Noticeable is the occurrence of E. superba in a significant number of food samples (15 and 10% for P. belcheri and P. desolata, respectively), suggesting feeding in distant foraging grounds in southern Antarctic waters, >1000 km from the breeding colonies, during the chick-rearing period. The stable-carbon and -nitrogen isotopic compositions of chick feathers were identical in both species, indicating no important trophic segregation during the breeding period, when adult birds are central-place foragers. The ratios were, however, different in adult feathers, suggesting moulting in Antarctic waters for P. belcheri and in subtropical waters for P. desolata, i.e. in distinct foraging areas when birds are not constrained to return to the colonies.",2-s2.0-0037029147

Body length land maturity-stage compositions of euphausiids were different among seasons, probably reflecting sea-ice condition in summer. The mean body length decreased and maturity regressed during each season in E. superba, which was partly attributable to the selective feeding on large, mature female krill by Adélie penguins. The 1995/1996 year class of E. superba, which was spawned when the sea ice was most developed, was strong and conspicuous in the 1996/1997 and 1997/1998 seasons.

The total-lipid data for E. superba exhibited seasonal variations, with low lipid levels in late winter/early spring and the highest levels in autumn. Seasonal changes were most pronounced in the immature and adult specimens, increasing from about 10% lipid of dry mass to more than 40%. The fatty-acid compositions of the younger stages were dominated by 20:5(n-3), 22:6(n-3) and 16:0. These are typical phospholipid fatty acids, which are major biomembrane constituents. The phospholipid composition was similar in the older stages. With increasing storage of triacylglycerols in the lipid-rich immature and adult stages, the fatty acids 14:0, 16:0 and 18:1(n-9) prevailed, comprising about 70% of total triacylglycerol fatty acids. The trophic-marker fatty acids 16:1(n-7) and 18:4(n-3), indicating phytoplankton ingestion, were less abundant. They reflected, however, the dependence of the larvae on phytoplankton as well as the seasonal changes in algal composition. The generally close linear relationships between fatty acids and lipid suggest that the fatty-acid compositions of the collected specimens were largely independent of the respective developmental stage, season and region. The linear fit indicates that triacylglycerol accumulation started at a level of about 5% of total lipid. Considering the various overwintering scenarios under discussion, the life cycle and reproductive strategies of krill are discussed in the context of the lipid metabolism and fatty-acid composition of E. superba. Lipid production is effective enough to accumulate large energy reserves for the dark season, but E. superba does not exhibit the sophisticated biosynthetic pathways known from other Antarctic euphausiids and copepods. Although important, lipid utilisation appears to be just one of several strategies of E. superba to thrive under the extreme Antarctic conditions, and this pronounced versatility may explain the success of this species in the Southern Ocean.",2-s2.0-0034895642

The survey progressed from 80 °E in late January to 150 °E in mid March. Krill varied in mean size across the survey area, and the various maturity stages showed some longitudinal and latitudinal trends. Males, early stage females, and juveniles were, on average, larger in the east of the survey area whereas gravid and spent females differed little in length across the survey area. Gravid females were only found north of the shelf break; juveniles, males and other stages of females were found throughout the latitudinal extent of the survey. Growth rate measurements resulted in comparable figures to other studies in the Indian Ocean and were greatest in February for all stages. Observed growth rates were sufficient to account for the changes in mean sizes of krill observed across the survey area. The mean density of krill revealed by nets (2.65 krill per 1000 m-3) was low compared to other areas that have been surveyed. Similarly, the overall estimates of proportional recruitment were below average when compared to the range of reported values. Krill larvae were moderately abundant in the survey area but were more frequently encountered in the east, which is probably a function of the lateness of the season when the larvae would be rising into the surface layer sampled by the net.

From early to mid-summer krill density increased and showed distinct offshore-inshore differences in abundance and maturity stages. In mid-summer, krill density was low in the oceanic zone (8 g m-2) and higher in the slope frontal zone (36 g m-2), being highest along the shelf break (131 g m-2) in the inshore zone. Krill were in the reproductive stage in the oceanic and frontal zones, but non-reproductive in the inshore zone. Water circulation, food and frontal features were considered important environmental factors determining the occurrence of high krill concentrations in these waters. Drifting buoys indicated that the surface water circulation in areas of krill concentrations was characterized by a sluggish current with eddies along the shelf break in the inshore zone and a shear current in the frontal zone, thus enhancing the residence time for krill. Diatom abundance in both the frontal and inshore zones increased from early to mid-summer, improving krill feeding conditions. Gravid females were closely associated with the frontal zone, showing that the latter may also be a favored spawning area because of the higher probability of survival for embryos and larvae; in addition to enhanced opportunities for their transport to nursery grounds by prevailing currents. In the waters north of the South Shetland Islands, krill appeared to be highly adapted for exploitation of the rich food resources of the frontal/inshore zone, taking advantage of oceanographic features that led to their retention in these zones.",2-s2.0-0031783385

Parents were found to use a 2-fold foraging strategy, on average performing 2 successive short trips at sea of 1 to 2 d duration followed by 1 long trip of 9 to 17 d. These long foraging trips are the longest yet recorded for any seabird. During short trips the parents tend to lose mass, feeding the chick with Australian krill and fish larvae caught in coastal and neritic waters around Tasmania. The prey are caught at maximum diving depths of 13 m on average (maximum 30 m). During long trips, adults gain mass and feed their chicks with a very rich mixture of stomach oil and digested food composed of a high diversity of prey including myctophid fish, sub-Antarctic krill and squids. Prey are probably caught mainly in the Polar Frontal Zone, at least 1000 km south of Tasmania, at maximum depths of 58 m on average (maximum 71 m). Long foraging trips in distant southern waters gave at least twice the yield of trips in close waters but during the former, yield decreased with the time spent foraging, as indicated by the inverse relationship between time spent foraging and adult body condition. Decisions whether to forage in close or distant waters appear to be determined by the body condition of the parents rather than by that of the chick. Good body condition of parents was associated with high blood prolactin levels: birds in poor body condition invested in the restoration of body reserves and went to the rich area of the Polar Frontal Zone or to Antarctic waters, whereas those in good condition continued to provision the chick with food caught in Tasmanian waters and use their body reserves. The species thus exploits 2 water masses that differ in profitability. Most of the energy budget for rearing the chick is balanced by prey caught in rich southern waters where the birds build up their body reserves and find most of the energy needed by the chick. However, nearby shallow waters are important for the breeding strategy as they allow an increased rate of energy flow to the chick. In a species as abundant as the short-tailed shearwater, the 2-fold strategy has the advantage of limiting competition in coastal and shallow waters, as at any one time only 17% of birds are feeding there. The influence of the marine environment and energetic constraints on the evolution of provisioning strategies is discussed.",2-s2.0-0032543585

From these examples, we argue that future management strategies for exploited fisheries must include effects of environmental variability. In particular, management strategies must be flexible enough to include delayed responses to environmental variations that result from the transfer of perturbations from larger to smaller scales and vice versa.

Metabolic turnover of carbon and nitrogen, manifested as temporal shifts in δ13C and δ15N, was tied closely to temperature. Larval krill reared at + 1.5°C had replaced 22-29% of their original body carbon at the conclusion of the experiment, but only 13-22% of their original body nitrogen. Larvae reared at - 1.5°C exhibited little evidence of carbon turnover and replaced less than 6% of their original body nitrogen. These are the first simultaneous, coupled measurements of long-term carbon and nitrogen turnover for any marine animal, and provide an essential calibration for the interpretation of stable isotope ratios in animals collected from the field. In addition to the feeding experiments, animals were starved for 2 months at + 1.5°C and - 1.5°C. Starved krill exhibited little isotopic change.

Copepods and chaetognaths dominated numerically, while chaetognaths and krill Euphausia superba dominated in biomass wet weight. Salpa thompsoni occurred in low densities (median 0.1 to 0.4/1000 m3), although during the same period a mass development was recorded from the South Shetland Island region. Density values for Euphausia crystallorophias were in the same range as reported from the southern Weddell Sea. Krill, Euphausia superba, biomass was lower than generally found in the Antarctic Peninsula and Elephant Island region. A distinct spatial separation for size groups was observed for salps, Euphausia crystallorophias and krill. Small salp size groups dominated in the East Wind Drift zone and larger ones further north under the influence of West Wind Drift waters. Larger size classes of E. crystallorophias concentrated in nearshore areas. Krill was smaller in neritc and larger in oceanic waters. The overall krill length frequency distribution was similar to that reported from the South Shetland Island region for the same period. The recruitment index for E. crystallorophias and Thysanoessa macrura age group 1+ indicated a very successful year-class 1992/93 in the region (Ri = 0.412 and Ri = 0.609, respectively), while krill showed the opposite, a poor recruitment of the 1992/93 year class (Ri - 0.076). Spawning was late during the 1994 season for E. crystallorophias and E. superba; no larvae were found in the area.

The vertical distribution and developmental stage composition of Rhincalanus gigas, Calanoides acutus, Calanus propinquus and krill, Euphausia superba larvae, were a good index for a general assessment of the seasonal condition of the plankton communities. There were five zones differing in seasonal situation: (1) The Polar Front and the southern ACC (not studied in detail). (2) The Weddell Front. (3) The Weddell Gyre interior, (4) The Maud Rise area, and (5) The Coastal Current zone. In the Weddell Front, the planktonic community resembled an autumnal situation with moderate phytoplankton biomass; the overwintering stock of copepods was not completely formed and the occurrence of calyptopes larvae of E. superba indicated that krill continued to reproduce until May. In the Weddell Gyre interior, a typical winter plankton community was found even before sea ice had formed. The specific hydrographic regime of the Maud Rise (governed by the mesoscale circulation over the seamount) support the late autumn conditions similar to the Weddell Front (but without early krill larvae). The plankton of the Coastal Current was a winter community. We conclude that in the eastern part of the Weddell Front (compared to the western part) seasonal development of both phytoplankton and herbivorous zooplankton is delayed in spring but prolonged in late autumn. Furthermore, it appears that the Weddell Sea ecosystem exhibits a much higher degree of spatial and temporal variability than thought before.

The Lagrangian calculations show that: (1) surface flow is the primary factor influencing the final location of the embryo-larva particle; and (2) timing of krill spawning affects the eventual position of the feeding larvae. Seasonal changes in the wind stress field result in variability in direction and velocity of surface currents, which affects the embryo-larva trajectories. Conditions favourable for the transport of larvae to Bransfield Strait occur early in the spawning season. East of the Antarctic Peninsula larvae have a greater probability of entering Bransfield Strait if the krill embryos are released in mid-summer, January to February. Embryos released to the north of the South Shetland Islands, west of 62°W are transported into Drake Passage. Embryos released to the north of the South Shetland Islands and east of Livingston Island are transported westward where they can eventually enter Bransfield Strait. Krill larvae also are transported into Bransfield Strait from the Bellingshausen and Weddell Seas. The Lagrangian trajectories show that the western Bransfield Strait is a region of potentially high larval concentration due to transport from surrounding areas as well as local production.

This model combines laboratory measurements of temperature effects on developmental times, density and physiology of krill embryos and larvae and the observed water temperature structure in the Bransfield Strait-South Shetland Islands region. Simulations with observed vertical temperature profiles from this region show that embryos that develop at temperatures less than 0°C hatch relatively deep (≈1000 m) or hit the bottom before hatching. The presence of warm (1-2°C) Circumpolar Deep Water (CDW), between 200 and 700 m, results in hatching depths of about 700 m. The sinking rate pattern characteristic of the embryos of Euphausia superba retains the embryos in the CDW, where development is accelerated. Larval ascent rate through the CDW is rapid, so larvae reach the surface before metamorphosing into the first feeding stage, and have sufficient carbon reserves to drift at the surface for several weeks before needing to find food. These results suggest that the sinking rate pattern characteristic of embryos of Antarctic krill may be part of a reproductive strategy that evolved in response to the thermal structure of its environment. The complementary component of this reproductive strategy is the observed correlation between the distribution of krill schools containing reproducing individuals and the presence of CDW. With this reproductive strategy, the spawning regions of Antarctic krill are in areas where oceanic conditions enhance the probability of survival of its embryos and non-feeding larvae. © 1992.",2-s2.0-0027009051

A total of 153 eggs from two species and 1368 larvae or juvenile stages from 12 species were obtained. These included pelagic species, and demersal species with a long pelagic larval or juvenile phase. Most abundant were larvae of Pleuragramma antarcticum and Notothenia kempi, and eggs of Notothenia neglecta. The distribution of notothenioid and paralepidid larvae was apparently unaffected by ice cover, whereas myctophid larvae were confined to ice-free waters. Areas where newly hatched Chionodraco hamatus occurred coincided with dense aggregations of Euphausia superba (Krill) furcilia larvae which is a potential food resource during winter. The hatching of icefish larvae during winter is apparently independent of the seasonal production cycle. Epipelagic eggs of Notothenia neglecta were found during the spawning season, which suggests that eggs ascend to the surface after demersal spawning and that development takes place near the sea surface during winter. Larvae of Notothenia kempi were chiefly confined to shelf and slope waters to the west of the Antarctic Peninsula, with larger larvae found in coastal shelf areas. Pleuragramma antarcticum occurred in the coastal waters off the Biscoe Islands, in the Gerlache Strait, and in the northern Bransfield Strait. The smallest larvae were found in the northern Bransfield Strait, whereas those at the Biscoe Islands and in Gerlache Strait waters were larger and of a similar size. A cyclonic gyre to the west of the Antarctic Peninsula observed in the austral summer was likely to have affected the larval drift of Pleuragramma antarcticum and Notothenia kempi. Differences in the timing of spawning and hatching and the vertical distribution of these larvae will lead to different transport and spatial distribution patterns. It is hypothesized that early winter conditions do not imply severe limitations on the year-class success of larval fish.

Physical processes control the extent of ice cover, the magnitude and location of food, and the distribution of pack ice predators; however, physical processes did not appear to directly affect krill. Instead, the seasonal distribution and behavior of krill was interpreted to be a function of the need to acquire food and avoid predators. These two factors also are hypothesized to be the proximate cause of swarming. Seasonal sea ice plays an integral role in the ecology of krill. Ice-edge blooms are an important and predictable food supply, particularly for reproducing adults and first-feeding larvae. Ice floes provide protection for larvae and juveniles, and sea ice biota, a widespread food source, are important to the survival of larvae during winter. In the marginal ice zone, overwintering strategies of adults included regression to an immature (sub-adult) stage, reduction of metabolic rate, and omnivorous feeding in the water column. Adults were not observed feeding on the undersurface of ice floes probably because of increased risk of predation from pack ice predators, but adult krill may migrate deeper into the pack ice in winter and also feed on ice biota. Sea ice biota act as a stabilizing mechanism against extreme seasonal oscillations of food supply for overwintering krill, thus contributing to the persistence of krill populations. -from Authors",2-s2.0-0026394971

The first critical period occurs during development of the non-feeding stages. Release of embryos over warm deep water (250-400 m) is advantageous for these early larval stages. The geographical distribution of spawning populations combined with the observed pattern in sinking rates of embryos during development form a reproductive strategy that maximises survival of the early non-feeding stages. The first winter is the second critical period. Physiological condition of larvae and juveniles is an index of their nutritional history and ability to survive and enter the adult population the following summer. Significant differences were found in the physiological condition of larvae collected during two winters which differed primarily in the degree of ice cover. Larvae in the heavy ice winter had higher growth rates, higher condition factor and more lipid.

During an initial (December to January) peak in production to phytoplankton and krill larvae in Gerlache Strait and adjacent parts of Bransfield Strait, so few post-larvae and adults were caught that the parent stock of those larvae could not be identified with certainty. However, small adults of 36-42 mm body length were caught in abundance later in the summer (February to March), after larval recruitment in and near Gerlache Strait had ceased. Many of these small adults then appeared to be post-reproductive. In Bransfield Strait during late summer (late February to March) there was a nearly equal mixture of small adults (which dominated in Gerlache Strait) and large adults (>42 mm): the large adults showed most evidence of recent reproductive activity and could have been responsible for much of the late summer larval recruitment in Bransfield Strait. In Drake Passage, large adults were usually dominant; the few caught in December were undergoing maturation near the South Shetlands, and in January they were reproductive and dispersed in more offshore oceanic waters. During late February to March, krill became more available in Drake Passage with many having reassembled in aggregations near Livingston Island (South Shetlands). By then, not only small adults but also large adults appeared post-reproductive in all areas. Evidence relating to growth rate in adults was obscured by erratic variations in ratios of body-length classes, month-to-month, considered artifacts on sampling. However, adult growth appeared negligible during January to March. After midsummer (January) there were distinct changes in relative abundances of males to females of >42 mm: within 43-47 mm the modal frequencies favored females, and within 48-55 mm males were dominant, suggesting differential survivorship. The Gerlache-Bransfield Straits and similar coastal habitats must be considered nursery areas, not only for immature krill as has been previously proposed, but also for early summer larvae. In particularly productive years, as in 1986-87, these coastal waters may become spawning localities for small adult krill before production by large adults develops farther away from the Peninsula. Immatures of <12 mm in December and ca 16-30 mm by March, comprised a subgroup of the smallest immature krill though not consistently abundant enough to be distinguished as a year class. Their distributions suggest origins and early growth outside of the study area, possibly in the Weddell Sea and coastal waters of the Bellingshausen Sea. © 1991.",2-s2.0-0026304315

Eu.phausia crystaliorophias was marginally more abundant within its restricted range. Distinct north-south variations in larval age and developmental stages of T. macrura were observed indicating regional differences in spawning. Euphausia frigida was mainly confined to the upper 200 m of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current. E. superba larvae produced north of the shelf break, between 70º-83ºE, moved north–east into the Antarctic Circumpolar Current. Larvae originating on the shelf moved rapidly west in the East Wind drift. E. crystallorophias had the same westward dispersion, but some larvae appeared to return eastward via the Prydz Bay Gyre and remain in the region.

Three principal biogeographic zones were identified: northern Gerlache Strait, Bransfield Strait and Drake Passage: these were recognizable by consistent patterns of physical circulation. Two cohorts of E. superba larvae were produced. The first cohort appeared as C1 larvae in mid-January, and the second appeared in mid-February; the second cohort did not occur in Gerlache Strait waters. Larvae in Gerlache Strait were more abundant, larger in size and weight, better fed, and developed and grew more rapidly than larvae of the same stages in both Bransfield Strait and Drake Passage. In Gerlache Strait abundance reached 12,000 individuals m-2, intermolt periods were &lt;8 days for early calyptopis stages, and growth rates were higher than any previously reported. Growth of early stages was exponential during late January, but slowed markedly by late March as the population entered late furcilia stages. Calyptopis stages were estimated to ingest up to 19.7% of their body carbon per day, and 14.5% of body nitrogen per day. The daily ration of late furcilia stages was reduced to 4.4% body carbon per day, and 1.9% body nitrogen per day. Gross growth efficiencies ranges, in terms of carbon, from 13.2% for furcilia to 52.5% for calyptopis stages; in terms of nitrogen they ranged from 29.9 to 65.5%. It is proposed that the northern Gerlache Strait is a primary nursery area for E. superba, and that local circulation promotes high primary productivity and prolongs the residence time of larvae in a nearshore environment which is favorable to development and growth. Coastal environments such as Gerlache Strait may make a disproportionately large contribution to annual krill recruitment. © 1991.",2-s2.0-0026273712

Seasonal feeding was examined from 1977/1978 (November-March). The diel feeding cycle was investigated during a 96 h station established in February 1976, while food selection was analyzed using larvae and zooplankton samples collected in February 1982. Hatching occurs in early spring, and larvae fed on eggs of calanoid copepods and on cyclopoid copepods. Copepod eggs were the principal food near the pack ice, and cyclopoids in open waters. Cyclopoids were the staple food in summer. Eggs of the Antarctic krill Euphausia superba were ingested selectively and formed major portions of the larval summer diet in neritic (Joinville Island) and oceanic (Elephant Island) spawning areas of E. superba. In the fall, copepods predominated in the diets. Most abundant and most frequently ingested prey in summer and fall were Oncaea spp. Feeding commenced at dawn and continued at least until dusk. Krill eggs were taken chiefly during morning hours and egg incidence declined during the day, suggesting that eggs were ingested soon after spawning. Prey size at the onset of feeding was estimated as 0.130 to 0.330 mm. Size-selective feeding was evident in small larvae, while in larger larvae median prey length remained constant. High feeding incidence among yolk-sac larvae in spring, high overall feeding incidence in summer, and size-selective foraging of small larvae suggested favorable feeding conditions in the 1977/1978 season. Yolk-absorption times in Antarctic fish larvae vary on a scale of weeks and may be further retarded due to early feeding. Hence, year-to-year variability of yolk incidence in N. larseni indicated variable biotic environments of early feeding larvae rather than temporal shifts of hatching periods. As hatching periods are constant between years in contrast to the variable retreat of the pack ice and subsequent onset of the production cycle in space and time, maternal yolk reserves are probably utilized to compensate for such variations. © 1990 Springer-Verlag.",2-s2.0-0025143853

The relative and absolute use of C and N during early development supported the hypothesis that lipid stores were the primary catabolic substratum during development to Cl and mid-way through Cl. Both measured and calculated estimates of the C required to develop from hatching to Cl indicated that larvae developing at higher temperatures used less energy to reach the Cl stage. After metamorphosis to the Cl stage, internal C reserves continued to satisfy ≈90% of calculated C requirements of fed larvae but the availability of food during this time may be important for development of the digestive enzyme system or of efficient feeding behavior. Development, growth, survival and elemental composition of larvae that experienced delays in food availability after metamorphosis to Cl were observed at 0 and 2 °C. Results of these experiments were used to determine the point-of-no-return (PNR) and quantify the importance of energy reserves to the first feeding stage. If initial delays in food availability exceed a certain point (PNR), starved larvae cannot recover when refed and eventually die. Short delays in food availability affected the timing of development, not the ability to continue to develop, but after iong delays the larvae lost the ability to metamorphose. The PNR depends not only on the initial energy reserves of the embryo but also on the amount of energy needed to reach Cl which in turn depends on the effect of temperature on O2 consumption rates and developmental times. The PNR of 10-14 days from the food availability experiments was similar to the calculated PNR from metabolic requirements and known lipid reserves. The calculated PNR increased with increasing temperature, from 9 to 15 days within the environmental range. Despite the narrow temperature range in the Southern Ocean, both temperature and food availability will affect the survival and recruitment of the early larvae of E. superba. © 1989.",2-s2.0-0024944991

Oxygen consumption rates of known age embryos and early larvae were measured at 0 ° C and at partial pressures ranging from 90 to 0% of air saturation. Four of the five stages of embryos (single cell, multiple cell, gastrula, and limb bud) and the larval stages (Nauplius I, Nauplius II, Metanauplius, and Calyptopis 1, the first feeding stage) regulated their oxygen uptake down to 7.3 kPa. Younger stages of embryos and larvae were able to regulate oxygen uptake at lower partial pressures of oxygen than older stages. Embryos close to hatching (twitch) were not good regulators. The oxygen consumption rates of the developing embryos and larvae usually will be independent of the partial pressure of oxygen in the environment. The pattern of oxygen consumption with age was similar to that of many fish: a low respiration rate at fertilization, increasing slowly until the embryos hatch, then a sharp increase at hatching when the larvae begin to swim, with a two-fold variability between the oxygen consumption rates of larvae of the same stage and age determined in different experiments. Embryo metabolism was only 3.45% of the total metabolic demand of all the non-feeding stages. Thus, most of the lipid reserves can be passed on to the larvae for use during development to the first feeding stage. Only the larvae were used in experiments to determine the effect of temperature on oxygen consumption rates. Experimental temperatures were -1,0, and 2 ° C, spanning nearly the full range of temperatures that the larvae encounter in the environment during early development. The effect of temperature on oxygen consumption was not linear. Oxygen consumption rates for the same age or stage larvae at 0 and 2 ° C were the same, and much higher than those at -1 ° C. The metabolism-temperature response suggests that oxygen consumption rates are temperature independent for the Calyptopis 1 larvae in the surface waters, where temperatures are usually > 0 ° C during the summer when these larvae appear. © 1989.",2-s2.0-0024483373

The relationship between temperature and developmental times was curvilinear, with a sharp decrease in developmental time between -1 and 0°C, followed by a gradual flattening of the curve. The relationship was best described by the exponential model D = B0* e-B1(T) + B2, where D is developmental time in days, T is the temperature, and B0, B1, and B2 are fitted constants. In three of the four batches of larvae reared at -1°C, all larvae died within 3 days of metamorphosis to Calyptopis 1, while siblings at higher temperatures developed normally. These results suggests that a cold sensitive period exists during early larval development. The type of food available also affected the survival of three groups of siblings. Larvae fed a diatom mixture developed normally, while those fed a small flagellate or starved all died before metamorphosis to Calyptopis 2. The effects of temperature and food type on the development and survival of the early larval stages have important ecological implications for the recruitment of E. superba. If spawning occurs in areas where the embryos or larvae encounter subzero water during a temperature sensitive period, recruitment in these waters may be very low, independent of food availability. If the embryos and larvae do not encounter subzero water during a sensitive period, recruitment may be more dependent on the type and concentration of food available. © 1988.",2-s2.0-0024260465

The most abundant crustacean was the amphipod Themisto gaudichaudii, which accounted for 90% of the total number but only 44% of the total weight of crustaceans eaten. Most (79%) of the Themisto were juveniles. Euphausiids were much less numerous in the diet (5% by number) but were the main group by weight (55%); most (52%) were Antarctic krill, with juveniles and sub‐adults (25–50 mm long) predominating. Mysids, copepods and barnacle larvae were also present. Fish were all myctophids (lanternfish), Protomyctophum normani and P. bolini being identified; specimens were 50–85 mm long and weighed 1–4 g. Meal sizes averaged 6‐5‐7‐5 g (14–22% adult body mass); about 75% of chicks were fed each day (mainly at night), about 10% probably receiving meals from both parents. A review of storm petrel diets emphasizes the importance of fish to Oceanodroma species and of crustaceans to Oceanites, Garrodia and Pelagodroma. Euphausiids and amphipods (chiefly Themisto and Hyperia) are the main crustacean prey and range from 5–50 mm and 0‐005‐0‐7 g. Myctophids are the main fish prey and range from 20–100 mm and 1–5 g. Meal size ranges from 15–25% adult body mass and chicks are fed on 50–85% of days.

The dominant acoustic target was Euphausia superba which occurred over the entire study area in the upper 100 m of the water column, either in aggregations or loosely defined layers. The vertical depth distribution under the pack ice was similar to that of open water. Average krill biomass under the ice ranged from 1 to 68 g m-2 and in open water range from 10 to 100 g m-2. Another euphausiid, Thysanoessa macrura, appeared to be ubiquitous but was much less abundant than E. superba. T. macrura also formed aggregations. All stages were found in open water, but only adults and juveniles under the ice. A few adults and larvae of a third euphausiid, E. frigida, were found only in open water. Salps, which were abundant in open water, were not present under the pack ice. The pack ice directly influenced the abundance and distribution of young krill. Juvenile E. superba were much more abundant under the ice than in open water north of the ice edge. Numerous observations were made of juvenile krill feeding on the undersurface of ice floes where chlorophyll concentrations were much greater than in the water column below. These observations appear to indicate that the pack ice serves as a giant nursery area for young krill, providing a refugium from predators as well as a vast food resource that may be critical to the survival of overwintering juvenile E. superba. © 1988.",2-s2.0-0024223373

In 1981, krill tended to form large, thick swarms and in 1984, smaller, more dispersed, shallower patches. March body lengths of juvenile-adult krill were 22-59 mm in 1981 and 13-59 mm in 1984. Near Elephant I. in 1981, krill &gt;45 mm were most numerous; in 1984 sizes &lt;45 mm were dominant.

Two deep stations (4100 m) west of the South Orkney Islands yielded more than 6600 eggs and early larvae per 100 m3 in the 1000 to 2000 m layer; also below 2000 m eggs and naupliar stages occurred.

Possibly krill may spawn not only near the surface but also at depths of several hundred meters. The high abundance of naupliar stages in smaples from our deepest layer corrobrate the presumption of Marschall and Hirche (1984) that the nearly immobile nauplii still sink and that the larvae begin to rise only when they have reached the metanaupliar stage. © 1986 Springer-Verlag.",2-s2.0-0000903009

Body lengths of given stages were generally less in 1984 than in 1981. Advanced furcilia stages, particularly, in the 1984 samples tended to be smaller than the same stages in March 1981, indicating relatively poor growth during February 1984. However, the 1984 younger larvae (calyptopes and the developmental forms of furcilia stages 1 and 2) indicated that, in 1984, recent (March) growth had been good - probably better than in February. Dierct observation of the development of calyptopis stage 3 to furcilia stage yielded a development time of 7.7 days, which compares favorably to the 8-day period estimated from field samples. Reduced food availability did not affect the development rate nor give rise to a clearly higher incidence of indirect pathways of development.

This experimental study on the embryology of Euphausia superba was conducted at the Palmer Station, Antarctica during the 1982-1983 austral summer. The gravid females were captured from Bransfield Strait aboard the R/V Hero. The various embryological stages such as early cleavage, blastula, gastrula and limb-bud nauplius larva were defined and described. The duration for these various developmental stages at 1 atm was also established at +2°C and compared with the timing of this event at negative temperature. Krill embryonic development is inhibited at 4°C. The sinking rate of eggs and embryos was also measured at various pressure. The data suggest that pressure does not significantly influence the sinking rate. There appears to be a wide variation of sinking rates of eggs within the same brood. based on a simulated model of sinking rate, egg development was studied at increasing pressure. Pressure of 5-20 atm accelerates the rate of cleavage and therefore the 32-celled stage is attained within 5-8 h, while at 1 atm it took 13 h to reach the same stage. Pressure thus seems to have some influence on the duration of the development of different developmental stages of krill embryos. © 1985 Springer-Verlag.",2-s2.0-0012340361

Five north-south transects during January to February 1981 showed that the earliest larval stages (calyptopes) of E. superba in the 0 to 200 m layer were throughout the mixing region, but most of the high densities were associated with subsurface thermal domes. This suggests that these were places where ascent of larvae from greater (hatching) depths was associated with mixing processes. Vertical transport may have aided larvae, resulting in high local survivorship. High chlorophyll a concentrations tended to be near, but not coincident with, high abundances of youngest E. superba larvae. Adult and sub-adult krill were widely dispersed. Swarms were found only near islands. A month later, in mid-March, dense concentrations of later larvae (furciliae), presumed to have developed from January to February calytopes, were still/again near the persistent front northeast of the South Orkneys (59 to 60°S). Regional groupings of larvae, previously distinguished by differing stage-frequency structures, occur in relation to segments of fronts in March. E. frigida is, numerically, a minor species. Calytopes were also concentrated near the front during January to February. The younger the stage, the farther south was its limit of distribution, indicating either southward progression in recruitment, or northeasterly dispersal of developing stages. T. macrura was the most broadly distributed species; high abundances of calyptopes 2 and 3-but not other larval stages-were associated with the frontal zone. Recruitment in T. macrura seems to have been more continuous, of longer duration, and more widespread than in the other two euphausiids. Relative abundances of E. superba larvae, E. superba adults, and T. macrura (larvae and adults) were examined along several March series of closely spaced samples. Highest numbers of E. superba adults usually co-occured with low numbers both of its larvae and of T. macrura. Maxima of E. superba larvae were associated with few or no adult E. superba. T. macrura were in nearly uniform proportion to E. superba larvae, along a transect of chlorophyll-depleted open ocean. Nearshore, abundances and relative proportions of these two species were less consistent, evidently reflecting variability in the coastal environment. © 1985.",2-s2.0-0000713724

Gymnosome and thecosomatons Pteropoda (Limacina and Clio spp.) were regularly present, as were Chaetognatha, and polychaetous annelids (Tomopteris). Fish larvae averaged only 3 or 4 per sample.-from Current Antarctic Literature",2-s2.0-0021565823

For the first time larvae of E. superba were found in significant amounts in the southern Weddell Sea. Except from shallow water and the most southern position, they were equal in abundance to the larvae of E. crystallorophias Holt&Tattersall.

New forms (1′, 2″, 3″ and 1″4′) have been recorded. The dominant forms of Furcilia-I stage are proposed to represent the initial dominants. In accordance with the initial dominance, five types of larval form combinations have been established. During the initial dominance change - from 5′ to 2′, the larval form number increases. This phenomenon is due to parallel development of euphauiid larvae; it results from a developmental pathway change in the main larval mass. Such deviations are reflected in an initial dominance change. In each pathway, the larvae pass through an unequal number of moults before reaching Form 5″ (in accordance with the proposed moult scheme of Furcilia-I stage larvae). In the case of initial dominance of less-developed forms, the presence of different parallel pathways increases. As a result, the total number of larval forms present in the plankton changes, causing increased variability of the total number of larval forms. Each type of larval form combination is the result of summation of all larval forms, which derive from different developmental pathways of the larvae in different localities. The most usual developmental pathway for Euphausia superba is through Form 5′, which may, thus, be regarded as the main developmental pathway for this species. This pathway probably corresponds to optimal environment conditions for larval growth and morphogenesis with maximal synchronisation of both processes. Consequently, it may be suggested that changes in developmental pathways of larvae are connected with suboptimal environmental conditions. © 1974 Springer-Verlag.",2-s2.0-0344887059

It is suggested that the reason why the mass concentrations of E. superba larvae are confined to the circulations of the Weddell Sea and the Eastern Drift is the high level of the upper boundary of dense bottom water which prevents the sinking of eggs to great depths. Outside these regions the hatched larvae seem unable to cover the great distance separating them from the upper water layers. © 1974 Springer-Verlag.",2-s2.0-0344817888
