Distribution of larval krill and zooplankton in association with hydrography in Marguerite Bay, Antarctic Peninsula, in austral fall and winter 2001 described using the Video Plankton Recorder	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY												The Western Antarctic Peninsula is a critical locus of Antarctic krill Euphausia superba abundance and thought to be a site of successful overwintering, particularly for the larval stages. A primary goal of the Southern Ocean GLOBEC program was to describe factors that contribute to the overwintering success of krill in this region. As part of this effort we conducted Video Plankton Recorder (VPR) surveys during austral fall and winter, 2001. The VPR survey yielded high-resolution distributions of larval krill, other plankton, and marine snow in relation to hydrography from a series of transect lines orthogonal to the coast on the continental shelf of the Western Antarctic Peninsula. Four taxa (larval krill, copepods, polychaetes, pteropods) and marine snow were numerous during fall; much lower abundances of all categories were present during winter, with only larval krill, copepods, and polychaetes present in any abundance. Distributions of plankton and marine snow were associated with water-mass types and the vertical structure of the environment, particularly for larval krill that were primarily associated with the pycnocline. During fall, larval krill were present across the entire shelf, with high abundances at the shelf break. Copepods were most numerous at depth during fall, consistent with ontogenetic migration to depth at the onset of winter. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Bioinformatic analyses of the publicly accessible crustacean expressed sequence tags (ESTs) reveal numerous novel neuropeptide-encoding precursor proteins, including ones from members of several little studied taxa	GENERAL AND COMPARATIVE ENDOCRINOLOGY												ESTs have been generated for many crustacean species, providing an invaluable resource for peptide discovery in members of this arthropod subphylum. Here, these data were mined for novel peptide-encoding transcripts, with the mature peptides encoded by them predicted using a combination of online peptide prediction programs and homology to known arthropod sequences. In total, 70 mature full-length/partial peptides representing members of 16 families/subfamilies were predicted, the vast majority being novel; the species from which the peptides were identified included members of the Branchiopoda (Daphnia carinata and Triops cancriformis), Maxillopoda (Caligus clemensi, Caligus rogercresseyi, Lepeophtheirus salmonis and Lernaeocera branchialis) and Malacostraca (Euphausia superba, Marsupenaeus japonicus, Penaeus monodon, Homarus americanus, Petrolisthes cinctipes, Callinectes sapidus and Portunus trituberculatus). Of particular note were the identifications of an intermediate between the insect adipokinetic hormones and crustacean red pigment concentrating hormone and a modified crustacean cardioactive peptide from the daphnid D. carinata: Arg(7)-corazonin was also deduced from this species, the first identification of a corazonin from a non-decapod crustacean. Our data also include the first reports of members of the calcitonin-like diuretic hormone, FMRFamide-related peptide (neuropeptide F subfamily) and orcokinin families from members of the Copepoda. Moreover, the prediction of a bursicon alpha from the euphausid E. superb represents the first peptide identified from any member of the basal eucaridean order Euphausiacea. In addition, large collections of insect eclosion hormone- and neuroparsin-like peptides were identified from a variety of species, greatly expanding the number of known members of these families in crustaceans.

In order to distinguish between Euphausia superba and other swarm-forming macroplankters we used a dual frequency echo-sounder (120 and 38 kHz) and echo-integrator during a series of Longhurst Hardy Plankton Recorder (LHPR) hauls near South Georgia. We compared the acoustic parameter Mean Volume Backscattering Strength (MVBS) according to the equation: DELTAMVBS (dB) = MVBS 120 kHz - MVBS 38 kHz. Mean values of DELTAMVBS for E. superba, Themisto gaudichaudii and E. frigida were 4.6, 9.7 and 15.6 dB, respectively, and were significantly different, allowing the 3 species to be separated acoustically.																	0171-8630					FEB	1993	93	1-2					17	24		10.3354/meps093017							WOS:A1993KV11900003

Intra-seasonal variation in foraging behavior among Ad,lie penguins (Pygocelis adeliae) breeding at Cape Hallett, Ross Sea, Antarctica	POLAR BIOLOGY												We investigated intra-seasonal variation in foraging behavior of chick-rearing Ad,lie penguins, Pygoscelis adeliae, during two consecutive summers at Cape Hallett, northwestern Ross Sea. Although foraging behavior of this species has been extensively studied throughout the broad continental shelf region of the Ross Sea, this is the first study to report foraging behaviors and habitat affiliations among birds occupying continental slope waters. Continental slope habitat supports the greatest abundances of this species throughout its range, but we lack information about how intra-specific competition for prey might affect foraging and at-sea distribution and how these attributes compare with previous Ross Sea studies. Foraging trips increased in both distance and duration as breeding advanced from guard to crSche stage, but foraging dive depth, dive rates, and vertical dive distances travelled per hour decreased. Consistent with previous studies within slope habitats elsewhere in Antarctic waters, Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) dominated chick meal composition, but fish increased four-fold from guard to crSche stages. Foraging-, focal-, and core areas all doubled during the crSche stage as individuals shifted distribution in a southeasterly direction away from the coast while simultaneously becoming more widely dispersed (i.e., less spatial overlap among individuals). Intra-specific competition for prey among Ad,lie penguins appears to influence foraging behavior of this species, even in food webs dominated by Antarctic krill.

Simultaneous surveys of marine birds, Antarctic fur seals and Antarctic krill were conducted along a series of transects radiating from the breeding colonies of the vertebrate predators. We examined the relationships between the distributions of predators and their prey with respect to the abundance of krill in the water column and marine habitats near the colonies. Antarctic fur seals and macaroni penguins showed positive correlations with Antarctic krill density across a wide range of spatial scales. Because krill was abundant close to the colony and predator densities decreased with distance due to geometry, distance from colony was a confounding variable. When the influences of distance and direction on predator abundance were factored out, we were able to demonstrate an additional influence of Antarctic krill abundance at measurement scales between 10 and 100 km for Antarctic fur seals and for macaroni penguins at the scale of 70 to 100 km. Water depth was an important correlate of Antarctic krill and Antarctic fur seal abundances but not of the abundance of macaroni penguins. We found no evidence that the fur seals or macaroni penguins were concentrating their foraging for krill in the vicinity of the shelf-break.

Individual animals were suspended in front of the transducers, were only loosely constrained, had substantial freedom to move, and showed more or less random orientation. One thousand echoes were collected per animal. Orientation data were recorded on video, The acoustic data were analyzed and target strengths determined from each echo. A method was developed for estimating the three-dimensional orientation of the krill based on the video images and was applied to five of them, giving their target strengths as functions of orientation. Scattering models based on a simplified distorted-wave Born approximation (DWBA) method were developed for five animals and compared with the measurements. Both measured and modeled scattering patterns showed that 120 kHz acoustic scattering levels are highly dependent on animal orientation. Use of these scattering patterns with orientation data from shipboard studies of E. superba gave mean scattering levels approximately 12 dB lower than peak levels. These results underscore the need for better in situ behavioral data to properly interpret acoustic survey results. A generic E. superba DWBA scattering model is proposed that is scalable by animal length. With good orientation information, this model could significantly improve the precision and accuracy of krill acoustic surveys. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Individuals used in the analyses were captured during fall and winter; for 8 species data were collected in both seasons. Seven of the 8 species showed some evidence that combustion of body stores were an aid to surviving the winter months; comparison with data from other investigators suggests that most of the species inhabiting shallow and mid-depths exhibit some degree of combustion of body stores during winter. Three types of overwintering strategies are proposed for Antarctic zooplankton and micronekton. Type 1, exhibited by some calanoid copepods, is characterized by accumulation of large lipid deposits and a true dormancy, or diapause, during winter. Type 2, exhibited by euphausiids and hyperiid amphipods, is characterized by a marked reduction in metabolic rate, combustion of body substance, opportunistic feeding, but no true dormancy. Type 3, 'business as usual' is exhibited by decapods and gammarid amphipods; it is characterized by an absence of a winter reduction in metabolic rate, combustion of body stores in some species but a lack of combustion or accumulation of energy in others, and opportunistic feeding. Over-wintering scenarios computed for Euphausia superba suggest that the impact of the winter season is most severe in the smaller size classes.																	0171-8630					OCT	1994	113	3					221	232		10.3354/meps113221							WOS:A1994PR37100002

Ecosystem modelling to quantify the impact of historical whaling on Southern Hemisphere baleen whales	FISH AND FISHERIES												Many baleen whales were commercially harvested during the 20th century almost to extinction. Reliable assessments of how this mass depletion impacted whale populations, and projections of their recovery, are crucial but there are uncertainties regarding the status of Southern Hemisphere whale populations. We developed a Southern Hemisphere spatial Model of Intermediate Complexity for Ecosystem Assessments (MICE) for phytoplankton, krill (Euphausia superba) and five baleen whale species, to estimate whale population trajectories from 1890 to present. To forward project to 2100, we couple the predator-prey model to a global climate model. We used the most up to date catch records, fitted to survey data and accounted for key uncertainties. We predict Antarctic blue (Balaenoptera musculus intermedia), fin (Balaenoptera physalus) and southern right (Eubalaena australis) whales will be at less than half their pre-exploitation numbers (K) even given 100years of future protection from whaling, because of slow growth rates. Some species have benefited greatly from cessation of harvesting, particularly humpbacks (Megaptera novaeangliae), currently at 32% of K, with full recovery predicted by 2050. We highlight spatial differences in the recovery of whale species between oceanic areas, with current estimates of Atlantic/Indian area blue (1,890, <1% of K) and fin (16,950, <4% of K) whales suggesting slower recovery from harvesting, whilst Pacific southern right numbers are <7% of K (2,680). Antarctic minke (Balaenoptera bonaerensis) population trajectories track future expected increases in primary productivity. Population estimates and plausible future predicted trajectories for Southern Hemisphere baleen whales are key requirements for management and conservation.

J	HOSIE, GW; COCHRAN, TG				HOSIE, GW; COCHRAN, TG			MESOSCALE DISTRIBUTION PATTERNS OF MACROZOOPLANKTON COMMUNITIES IN PRYDZ BAY, ANTARCTICA JANUARY TO FEBRUARY 1991	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												Previous large-scale surveys of the Prydz Bay region (Antarctica) have identified the continental shelf edge of Prydz Bay as an area of rapid transition between 3 major zooplankton communities. One of these communities is dominated by the Antarctic krill Euphausia superba. This community was located mainly along the continental shelf edge, usually between the offshore main oceanic community dominated by copepods and chaetognaths, and the neritic community dominated by E. crystallorophias. In January to March 1991, the Prydz Bay continental shelf area was the subject of a more intensive mesoscale survey to more accurately define the distribution patterns of the 3 zooplankton communities in that area. Cluster analysis and non-metric multidimensional scaling were used to define the communities, their distribution patterns, indicator species and species affinities. The composition of the communities were much the same as previously defined. E. superba again exhibited a distinct dissociation from all other species. However, the distribution pattern of the krill-dominated community was different from those previously observed. That community did not separate the copepod- and E. crystallorophias-dominated communities in Prydz Bay and apparently was displaced to the west. Temperature was strongly correlated with the zooplankton community distribution patterns, suggesting that temperature has more influence at the mesoscale level than at larger scales. Sea ice patterns, chlorophyll a abundance and salinity were also correlated, to a lesser extent, with the community distribution patterns.																	0171-8630					MAR	1994	106	1-2					21	39		10.3354/meps106021							WOS:A1994NB76600003

We projected growth trajectories for individual krill within cohorts and estimated how total biomass in an area available to both predators and the fishery may vary from year to year simply due to fluctuations in temperature. We used an existing temperature-dependent growth model and a time series of temperature data (1970 to 2004) for 2 regions in the Southern Ocean: (1) around the Antarctic Peninsula, and (2) around the island of South Georgia. The growth model predicted increasing individual size within a cohort (in terms of length and weight) with increasing temperature in the cooler Antarctic Peninsula region and decreasing individual size with increasing temperature in the warmer South Georgia region. Years with many cohorts of small individuals in the population resulted in biomass well below average, whereas years with many cohorts of large individuals resulted in biomass well above the average, suggesting that temporal changes in Southern Ocean temperatures may have profound effects on the total biomass in an area that is available to both predators and the fishery. Moreover, the effects of a potentially warming Southern Ocean on krill biomass will likely be more pronounced in the warmer regions occupied by krill.

EFFECTS OF RECRUITMENT VARIABILITY AND NATURAL MORTALITY ON GENERALISED YIELD MODEL PROJECTIONS AND THE CCAMLR DECISION RULES FOR ANTARCTIC KRILL	CCAMLR SCIENCE												The generalised yield model (GYM) was used by CCAMLR to establish the precautionary catch limit for the Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) fishery. The current precautionary catch limit was based on supplying the GYM with a natural mortality rate of 0.8 and recruitment variability generated using a Beta distribution for proportional recruitment of krill. In this study, krill sampling data for empirical size frequencies were supplied to the GYM as the 'vector of recruitments' input option to simulate the population dynamics of krill around the Antarctic Peninsula (Subarea 48.1) along with increasing rates of natural mortality. The annual proportions of krill less than 36 mm in length to the total captured in net samples in four sampling areas of the Peninsula were used as proxies for recruitment variability. The variability of proportional recruitment in the CCAMLR study areas was similar to the variability in other krill studies and in the annual size distributions of krill in penguin diets. Simulations with either no fishing, or with fishing at the trigger level (lowest catches), at approximately half the precautionary catch limit (intermediate), or at the precautionary catch limit (highest) were conducted. As the values for natural mortality, recruitment variability and catch were increased, fewer of the scenarios were able to meet the CCAMLR decision rules. The higher precautionary level of catch was not obtainable while meeting CCAMLR decision criteria for at least two of the four recruitment vectors based on net sampling, regardless of how the specified parameters for recruitment and mortality were combined. Any substantial future increases in krill harvests in Area 48 beyond the trigger level require verification that the krill recruitment variability, natural mortality, and other parameters specified in the scenarios used to test management criteria, adequately represent the range of plausible values encompassing krill population biology.																	1023-4063						2013	20						81	96									WOS:000326924700006

Information on the reproductive status of S. thompsoni in the high Southern Ocean is thus essential to understanding salp population growth and predicting changes in the Southern Ocean ecosystem. We carried out stratified and quantitative sampling from the surface to a depth of 2000 m during the austral summer of 2008 to determine the spatial distribution and population structure of S. thompsoni in the Southern Ocean off Adelie Land. We found two salp species, S. thompsoni and Ihlea racovitzai, with the former being dominant. S. thompsoni was distributed north of the continental slope area, while I. racovitzai was observed in the neritic zone. Mature aggregates and solitary specimens of S. thompsoni were found south of the Southern Boundary of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current, suggesting that S. thompsoni is able to complete its life cycle in high Antarctic waters during the austral summer. However, S. thompsoni was sparsely distributed in the continental slope area, and absent south of the Antarctic Slope Front, suggesting that it is less competitive with krill for food in the slope area off Adelie Land, where krill is densely distributed during the austral summer.

Most flocks were in the vicinity of a large inshore patch of Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba), and most observed feeding was by Black-browed Albatross, which appeared to initiate and dominate the flocks. Short feeding bouts by surface-feeding species appeared to be coupled with the surfacing of penguins and seals.

J	Sylvester, ZT; Long, MC; Brooks, CM				Sylvester, Zephyr T.; Long, Matthew C.; Brooks, Cassandra M.			Detecting Climate Signals in Southern Ocean Krill Growth Habitat	FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE												Climate change is rapidly altering the habitat of Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba), a key species of the Southern Ocean food web. Krill are a critical element of Southern Ocean ecosystems as well as biogeochemical cycles, while also supporting an international commercial fishery. In addition to trends forced by global-scale, human-driven warming, the Southern Ocean is highly dynamic, displaying large fluctuations in surface climate on interannual to decadal timescales. The dual roles of forced climate change and natural variability affecting Antarctic krill habitat, and therefore productivity, complicate interplay of observed trends and contribute to uncertainty in future projections. We use the Community Earth System Model Large Ensemble (CESM-LE) coupled with an empirically derived model of krill growth to detect and attribute trends associated with "forced," human-driven climate change, distinguishing these from variability arising naturally. The forced trend in krill growth is characterized by a poleward contraction of optimal conditions and an overall reduction in Southern Ocean krill habitat. However, the amplitude of natural climate variability is relatively large, such that the forced trend cannot be formally distinguished from natural variability at local scales over much of the Southern Ocean by 2100. Our results illustrate how natural variability is an important driver of regional krill growth trends and can mask the forced trend until late in the 21st century. Given the ecological and commercial global importance of krill, this research helps inform current and future Southern Ocean krill management in the context of climate variability and change.																		2296-7745				JUN 15	2021	8								669508	10.3389/fmars.2021.669508							WOS:000663821600001

Long-term variability in the diet and reproductive performance of penguins at Bird Island, South Georgia	MARINE BIOLOGY												Inter-annual variability in diet during crsche ( December to February) over 22 years ( 1989-2010) was examined for gentoo penguins Pygoscelis papua breeding at Bird Island, South Georgia ( 54 degrees 00 ' S, 38 degrees 03 degrees W). Overall, diets comprised 51% crustaceans and 49% fish by mass. Crustaceans were present in 89% of samples and were the main prey (> 50% by mass) in 10 years of the study. Antarctic krill Euphausia superba were present in 85% of all diet samples. Fish were present in 79% of samples and were the main prey in 12 years, with Champsocephalus gunnari and Lepidonotothen larseni the most frequently recorded species, in 51 and 33% of samples, respectively. The energy or mass of krill in the diet was the most reliable predictor of breeding success (the number of chicks fledged per breeding pair); the correlation between model-predicted and observed values was 0.58. We compared annual patterns of gentoo penguin diet variability with those of macaroni penguins Eudyptes chrysolophus breeding at the same location. Our results suggest that the availability of krill is a key source of diet variability for both species, but their diets indicate that gentoo penguins are generalist predators (feeding on pelagic and bentho-pelagic prey), while macaroni penguins are krill specialists (feeding on pelagic prey).

J	Reid, K				Reid, K			Growth rates of Antarctic fur seals as indices of environmental conditions	MARINE MAMMAL SCIENCE												The growth rates of Antarctic fur seal (Arctocephalus gazella) pups estimated from weighing cross-sections of the population were compared with measured/ inferred changes in the availability of their main prey species, Antarctic krill (Eupkausia superba) from 1989 to 2000. There was no relationship between growth rate and mass at weaning and there were counter-intuitive indications of higher growth rates in years of low krill availability. Biases reflecting changes in the component of the population available for sampling appear to invalidate the widely held assumption that interannual differences in growth rate can reliably he derived from differences in the slope of a linear relationship based on cross-sectional population samples. A new index was developed, based on the deviation of pup mass at age in each year compared to the multiyear mean, that was not dependent on assumptions of linearity. The indices of growth deviates produced a more logical relationship with other indices of pup development and related more appropriately to variations in prey availability. The potential impact of methodological biases on the interpretation of growth rate suggests that comparisons of growth rates should not rely on assumptions regarding the underlying growth pattern.																	0824-0469	1748-7692				APR	2002	18	2					469	482		10.1111/j.1748-7692.2002.tb01049.x							WOS:000175164000010

Variable food absorption by Antarctic krill: Relationships between diet, egestion rate and the composition and sinking rates of their fecal pellets	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY												The kinetics of food processing by zooplankton affects both their energy budgets and the biogeochemical fate of their fecal pellets. We sampled 40 schools of krill across the Scotia Sea during spring, summer and autumn and found that in all 3 seasons, every aspect of their absorption and defecation varied greatly. The C content of fecal pellets varied from 0.85% to 29% of their dry mass (median 9.8%) and C egestion rates varied 75-fold. C:N mass ratios of pellets ranged from 4.9 to 13.2 (median 7.8), higher than values of 3.9 in the krill and 5.4 in their food, pointing to enhanced uptake of N. Pellet sinking rates equated to 27-1218 m d(-1) (median 304 m d(-1)), being governed mainly by pellet diameter (80-600 mu m, mean 183 mu m) and density (1.038-1.391 g cm(-3), mean 1.121 g cm(-3)). Pellets showed little loss of C or N in filtered seawater over the first 2 days and were physically robust. When feeding rates were low, slow gut passage time and high absorption efficiency resulted in low egestion rates of pellets that were low in C and N content. These pellets were compact, dense and fast-sinking. Conversely, in good feeding conditions much food tended to pass quickly through the gut and was not efficiently absorbed, producing C and N-rich, slow-sinking pellets. Such "superfluous feeding" probably maximises the absolute rates of nutrient absorption. Food composition was also important: diatom-rich diets depressed the C content of the pellets but increased their sinking rates, likely due to silica ballasting. So depending on how krill process food, their pellets could represent both vehicles for rapid export and slow sinking, C and N-rich food sources for pelagic scavengers. C egestion rates by krill averaged 3.4% of summer primary production (and ingestion rates would be 2-10-fold higher than this) so whatever the fate of the pellets, krill are an important re-packager within the food web. While salp pellets tend to sink faster than those of krill, it is the latter that tend to prevail in sediment traps. We suggest that this is because krill schools are more compact, producing "rain showers" of pellets that exceed the capacity of pelagic scavengers to reprocess them. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

The isotopic niche is reflected by the ecological position and functional role of a species, which can be altered depending on these environmental changes. We assessed the isotopic niche and trophic positions (TP) of 3 seabirds on the Barton Peninsula, King George Island, Antarctica, to understand ecological interaction among the species. The average TP of Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) (hereafter "krill") (2.6 +/- 0.1) was estimated by using the compiled published data of the compound-specific nitrogen isotope ratio of glutamic acid and phenylalanine in the Southern Ocean, and TP values of the seabirds based on that of krill to be reliable according to ecological knowledge. Our results on the overlap of the isotopic niches of seabirds suggests potential diet competition among the consumers, such as the brown skua (Stercorarius antarcticus) and south polar skua (Stercorarius maccormicki), whereas the distinct and broad isotopic niche width of kelp gulls (Larus dominicanus) suggesting that their adaptation through generalization was related to their extended habitat and various food sources. Our research indicates that isotopic niche of seabirds reflects their survival strategy for food competition. Consequently, these seabirds can be easily influenced by alternative food sources, including terrestrial and human-derived sources, by rapid environmental changes, indicating that they are valuable as key environmental species and require long-term monitoring in the Antarctic Peninsula.																	0272-7714	1096-0015				SEP 5	2021	258								107443	10.1016/j.ecss.2021.107443							WOS:000679383300001						
J	Nicol, S; Foster, J; Kawaguchi, S				Nicol, Stephen; Foster, Jacqueline; Kawaguchi, So			The fishery for Antarctic krill - recent developments	FISH AND FISHERIES												The fishery for Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) is the largest by tonnage in the Southern Ocean. The catch remained relatively stable at around 120 000 tonnes for 17 years until 2009, but has recently increased to more than 200 000 tonnes. The Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources precautionary catch limits for this species total over 8.6 million tonnes so it remains one of the oceans largest known underexploited stocks. Recent developments in harvesting technology and in products being derived from krill indicate renewed interest in exploiting this resource. At the same time, there are changes in the Southern Ocean environment that are affecting both krill and the fishery. This paper summarizes the current state of this fishery and highlights the changes that are affecting it.

J	Mayzaud, P; Boutoute, M; Alonzo, F				Mayzaud, P; Boutoute, M; Alonzo, F			Lipid composition of the euphausiids Euphausia vallentini and Thysanoessa macrura during summer in the Southern Indian Ocean	ANTARCTIC SCIENCE												Two species of euphausiids (Thysanoessa macrura Sars and Euphausia vallentini Stebbing) from the Southern Indian Ocean were analysed for their lipid content, fatty acid and fatty alcohol composition, in relation to developmental stage (T.m) and sex (E.v). Lipid composition showed wax esters and triacylglycerols as main neutral lipids for T macrura and E. vallentini respectively. Allometric relationships between lipid class and total lipids indicated that changes in total lipids were size dependent and mainly related to wax esters in T macrura and polar lipids (both phosphatidylcholine or PC and phosphatidylethanolamine or PE) in E. vallentini. No difference in lipid composition could be shown for mate and female E. vallentini, while sampling location, developmental stage and sex were significantly influential in T macrura. In this latter species wax esters displayed relatively similar fatty acid and alcohol composition in both juvenile and female stages, whereas a striking difference could be seen between females and juveniles in terms of polar lipids with a very low PE content in females. Male and female E. vallentini showed little differences in fatty acid structure with the exception of PC in females, which were low in 22:6n-3. The trophic status of these two species was established using multivariate discriminant analysis, which indicated for E. vallentini a degree of omnivory similar to E. superba, while these T macrura appeared more omnivorous than individuals collected in other areas of the Southern Ocean. Clustering of polar lipid composition suggested a link between differences in PC fatty acid and the post-spawn stage of the female of E. vallentini collected. The same probably applies for the changes in PE recorded for T macrura females.																	0954-1020					DEC	2003	15	4					463	475		10.1017/S0954102003001573							WOS:000187366600008

The present study demonstrates that TAG compounds, in addition to phospholipids and lysophospholipids, are an important lipid class in pure krill oil. The fatty acid composition of TAG molecules from krill oil and their distribution on the backbone of TAG structures were determined by gas chromatography and liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometric, respectively. The content of omega 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFA) was similar to those reported in the literature for fish oil. It was estimated that 21 % of n-3 PUFA were at the sn-2 position of TAG structures. To our knowledge, this is the first determination and structural characterization of TAG in pure krill oil supplements.																	0024-4201	1558-9307				FEB	2014	49	2					163	172		10.1007/s11745-013-3855-6							WOS:000330721100005	24190513

Modeling the spatial and temporal dynamics of foraging movements of humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) in the Western Antarctic Peninsula	MOVEMENT ECOLOGY												Background: A population of humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) spends the austral summer feeding on Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) along the Western Antarctic Peninsula (WAP). These whales acquire their annual energetic needs during an episodic feeding season in high latitude waters that must sustain long-distance migration and fasting on low-latitude breeding grounds. Antarctic krill are broadly distributed along the continental shelf and nearshore waters during the spring and early summer, and move closer to land during late summer and fall, where they overwinter under the protective and nutritional cover of sea ice. We apply a novel space-time utilization distribution method to test the hypothesis that humpback whale distribution reflects that of krill: spread broadly during summer with increasing proximity to shore and associated embayments during fall. Results: Humpback whales instrumented with satellite-linked positional telemetry tags (n = 5), show decreased home range size, amount of area used, and increased proximity to shore over the foraging season. Conclusions: This study applies a new method to model the movements of humpback whales in the WAP region throughout the feeding season, and presents a baseline for future observations of the seasonal changes in the movement patterns and foraging behavior of humpback whales (one of several krill-predators affected by climate-driven changes) in the WAP marine ecosystem. As the WAP continues to warm, it is prudent to understand the ecological relationships between sea-ice dependent krill and krill predators, as well as the interactions among recovering populations of krill predators that may be forced into competition for a shared food resource.																	2051-3933						2015	3								13	10.1186/s40462-015-0041-x							WOS:000215741800013	26034604

Submesoscale distribution of Antarctic krill and its avian and pinniped predators before and after a near gale	MARINE BIOLOGY												We conducted two ship-based surveys of the nearshore ecosystem north of Livingston Island, Antarctica during 2-10 February 2005. Between the two surveys, a low-pressure system (963 mbar) passed through the area providing the opportunity to measure ecosystem parameters before and after a near gale. A ship-based multiple-frequency acoustic-backscatter survey was used to assess the distribution and relative abundance of Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba). Net tows, hydrographic profiles, and meteorological data were collected to measure biological and physical processes that might affect the krill population. During the survey, the distribution and behavior of several krill predators [chinstrap penguins (Pygoscelis antarctica), cape petrels (Daption capense), and Antarctic fur seals (Arctocephalus gazella)] were measured from the vessel by visual observations. The survey encompassed an area of roughly 2,500 km(2), containing two submarine canyons with one to the west and one to the east of Cape Shirreff, which had different abundances of krill and predators. Several aspects of the nearshore ecosystem changed after the near gale including: hydrography of the upper 100 m of the water column, phytoplankton biomass, the abundance and distribution of krill, and the distribution of some krill predators. Differences in these parameters were also measured between the two canyons. These changes in the physical and biological environment during the survey period are quantified and show that the ecosystem exhibited significant changes over relatively short spatial (tens of kilometers) and time (tens of hours) scales.

Temperature-dependent growth of Thysanoessa macrura: inter-annual and spatial variability around Elephant Island, Antarctica	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												Somatic growth of pelagic invertebrates is controlled by temperature and food, both of which vary in space and time. Species-specific growth rate responses to environmental variability may affect populations through changes in reproductive potential; therefore, measuring spatial and temporal variability in growth rates of highly abundant zooplankton is critical to predict the impact of climate change on pelagic ecosystems. Here, we used length frequencies from bi-annual surveys conducted 1 month apart to estimate growth rates of one the most abundant euphausiids in the Southern Ocean, Thysanoessa macrura. We analyzed summer data from 4 separate years (1995, 1998, 2001, and 2004) that varied widely in temperature and primary production. Stations within the surveys were grouped by water characteristics: warm, low salinity Antarctic Circum polar Current (ACC) water, and cold, saline Bransfield Strait and Weddell Sea (MBW) water, to assess inter-annual and spatial variability in cohort growth. Mid-summer cohort growth rates of T. macrura varied between years and water masses, ranging from -0.037 mm d(-1) in MBW water in 2004 to 0.081 mm d(-1) in ACC water in 1995. Growth rates were faster in ACC water than in MBW water during all years. Growth rates were strongly correlated with temperature (R-2 = 0.82) but weakly correlated with copepod density (R-2 = 0.38), and were not correlated with chl a concentration (R-2 = 0.11). These results suggest that the growth rates of T. macrura may increase in regions exhibiting warming trends, such as the Antarctic Peninsula. This contrasts with published data on the growth rates of Euphausia superba, which is predicted to be impacted negatively by climate warming.																	0171-8630	1616-1599				JUN 8	2015	529						49	61		10.3354/meps11291							WOS:000356076000004

Seabed foraging by Antarctic krill: Implications for stock assessment, bentho-pelagic coupling, and the vertical transfer of iron	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												A compilation of more than 30 studies shows that adult Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) may frequent benthic habitats year-round, in shelf as well as oceanic waters and throughout their circumpolar range. Net and acoustic data from the Scotia Sea show that in summer 2-20% of the population reside at depths between 200 and 2000 m, and that large aggregations can form above the seabed. Local differences in the vertical distribution of krill indicate that reduced feeding success in surface waters, either due to predator encounter or food shortage, might initiate such deep migrations and results in benthic feeding. Fatty acid and microscopic analyses of stomach content confirm two different foraging habitats for Antarctic krill: the upper ocean, where fresh phytoplankton is the main food source, and deeper water or the seabed, where detritus and copepods are consumed. Krill caught in upper waters retain signals of benthic feeding, suggesting frequent and dynamic exchange between surface and seabed. Krill contained up to 260 nmol iron per stomach when returning from seabed feeding. About 5% of this iron is labile, i.e., potentially available to phytoplankton. Due to their large biomass, frequent benthic feeding, and acidic digestion of particulate iron, krill might facilitate an input of new iron to Southern Ocean surface waters. Deep migrations and foraging at the seabed are significant parts of krill ecology, and the vertical fluxes involved in this behavior are important for the coupling of benthic and pelagic food webs and their elemental repositories.

Ice algae and pelagic phytoplankton represent the primary sources of nutrition for higher trophic-level organisms in seasonally ice-covered areas, but their relative contributions to polar marine consumers remain largely unexplored. Here, we investigated the potential of diatom-specific lipid markers and highly branched isoprenoids (HBIs) for estimating the importance of these two carbon pools in an Antarctic pelagic ecosystem. Using GC-MS analysis, we studied HBI biomarkers in key marine species over three years in Adelie Land, Antarctica: euphausiids (ice krill Euphausia crystallorophias and Antarctic krill E. superba), fish (bald notothens Pagothenia borchgrevinki and Antarctic silverfish Pleuragramma antarcticum) and seabirds (Adelie penguins Pygoscelis adeliae, snow petrels Pagodroma nivea and cape petrels Daption capense). This study provides the first evidence of the incorporation of HBI lipids in Antarctic pelagic consumers. Specifically, a di-unsaturated HBI (diene) of sea ice origin was more abundant in ice-associated species than in pelagic species, whereas a tri-unsaturated HBI (triene) of phytoplanktonic origin was more abundant in pelagic species than in ice-associated species. Moreover, the relative abundances of diene and triene in seabird tissues and eggs were higher during a year of good sea ice conditions than in a year of poor ice conditions. In turn, the higher contribution of ice algal derived organic matter to the diet of seabirds was related to earlier breeding and higher breeding success. HBI biomarkers are a promising tool for estimating the contribution of organic matter derived from ice algae in pelagic consumers from Antarctica.

Abundance and grazing impacts of krill, salps and copepods along the 140 degrees E meridian in the Southern Ocean during summer	ANTARCTIC SCIENCE												Abundance and grazing impacts of krill, salps and herbivorous copepods were investigated in Antarctic waters along the 140 degrees E meridian, south of Australia, during the summers of 2002 and 2003. North of the Southern Boundary of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (SB-ACC), macrozooplankton comprised species of Salpa thompsoni and large herbivorous copepods, while the area south of the SBACC was numerically dominated by Euphausia superba or E. crystallorophias. North of the SB-ACC, the estimate of grazing impact revealed that krill, salps and copepods, Calanoides acutus, Calanus propinquus, Rhincalanus gigas and Metridia gerlachei, are able to remove a maximum of 37% of the total phytoplankton standing stock in early to midsummer, but grazing is negligible in late summer. The high grazing impact is attributed to the relatively high zooplankton abundance and low phytoplankton abundance. South of the SB-ACC, overall daily grazing impact of the three zooplankton groups was low and did not exceed 6% of the total phytoplankton standing stock throughout the investigation period. Present results indicate that the contribution of krill, salps and copepods varies seasonally as well as regionally across the SB-ACC. It seems that the carbon transport from surface to deep water by macro- and mesozooplankton in summer in this area is relatively large north of the SB-ACC but small south of the SB-ACC.

Euphausiids constituted on average 96% by mass, while fish contributed 4% by mass. Amphipods were present in small amounts. Antarctic krill Euphausia superba was the predominant component throughout the sampling period. In contrast, Euphausia crystallorophias occurred rarely. Differences in the size of krill taken by Adelie penguins appear to reflect either local changes in the availability of certain age classes at various times in the breeding season, or differences in foraging areas, or are due to year-to-year differences in prey availability and abundance, possibly caused by variations in seasonal ice cover. Pleuragramma antarcticum constituted the bulk of the fish portion, particularly during the guard period.																	0722-4060					JUL	1995	15	6					415	418									WOS:A1995RJ23800004

Antarctic macrozooplankton of the southwest Atlantic sector and Bellingshausen Sea: Baseline historical distributions (Discovery Investigations, 1928-1935) related to temperature and food, with projections for subsequent ocean warming	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY												Since the Discovery Investigations of the 1920s and 1930s, seawater temperatures have increased in the Atlantic sector by similar to 1 degrees C; greater than the global mean rise. The aims of this paper were first to rescue the Discovery macrozooplankton data, second to provide quantitative "baseline" distribution maps, relating these to indices of temperature and food. Our third aim was to use the relationships we derived between abundance and temperature to project the potential affect of a 1 degrees C warming on the Discovery era distribution patterns. Based on the 1 m ringnet data retrieved from 615 stations (Nov-March), four taxa comprised >90% of the Antarctic macrozooplankton abundance: Rhincalanus gigas, Thysanoessa spp., Euphausia superba, and Chaetognaths. Most of the taxa, especially the more abundant ones, were warm water species penetrating into Antarctica and thus total macrozooplankton abundance decreased about 100-fold from 50 degrees S to 70 degrees S. While temperature correlated best with distribution at this large scale, food availability (proxied by a present-day satellite-based Chlorophyll a climatology) had a secondary effect, with the major euphausiids Euphausia superba and Thysanoessa spp. concentrated in high chl a areas. A modelled uniform 1 degrees C temperature rise produced a poleward shift for all taxa, but the Antarctic continent blocked this re-adjustment for the high latitude species, constricting their predicted range. More widespread polar/sub-polar species were predicted to increase their penetration into Antarctica by 4-12 degrees in latitude, whereas the poleward shift in potential range of sub-Antarctic taxa were limited by the steep temperature gradient across the Antarctic Polar Front (APF). However, within the Scotia Sea the relatively warm temperatures of the northern Antarctic Zone, abundant food due to iron fertilisation and intense eddy activity provide a "gateway" for northern species to penetrate south of the APF. Our model predictions, based on measured distributional ranges and observed temperature increases, provide a yardstick with which to compare modern day data compilations and assess the potential effects of future temperature increases.

K.; Collins, Martin A.; Belchier, Mark			Biology and distribution of South Georgia icefish (Pseudochaenichthys georgianus) around South Georgia and Shag Rocks	ANTARCTIC SCIENCE												Pseudochaenichthys georgianus is a member of the unique Channichthyidae family of fishes, which lack haemoglobin. The distribution, length-frequency and summer diet are described from 14 bottom trawl surveys undertaken in the summers between 1986 and 2006. Pseudochaenichthys georgianus (50-590 mm TL) were caught throughout the South Georgia shelf from depths of 76-370 m, but very few specimens (< 1%) were caught on the Shag Rocks shelf. Multiple cohorts were present during each survey and length-frequency analysis of these cohorts suggests that growth is fast during the first 3-4 years. Stomach contents analysis (2005 & 2006) indicated that P. georgianus is a pelagic or semi pelagic predator, with the summer diet dominated by Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba). Fish (channichthyids and notothenids) were also taken, but were a relatively minor part of the diet.				, Martin/ABE-6728-2020; Collins, Martin A/J-8560-2017; Reid, William/J-8528-2013	Reid, William/0000-0003-0190-0425												0954-1020	1365-2079				AUG	2008	20	4					343	353		10.1017/S0954102008000990							WOS:000257842500005

Macroalgae, gammarid amphipods and gastropods dominated the diet in the summer 1999/00 (IFA respectively 0.32, 0.32 and 0.21), at Ipanema, while macroalgae were dominant at Smok (IFA = 0.67), where krill and amphipods were secondary prey (IFA respectively 0.12 and 0.14) and gastropods were absent. Thus, the diet composition of N. coriiceps can possibly be used as an indicator of the presence of pelagic krill swarms.

Time budgets and at-sea behaviour of lactating female Antarctic fur seals Arctocephalus gazella at Bouvetoya	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												We present the first data on attendance patterns, at-sea movements and (living behaviour of Antarctic fur seals breeding at Bouvetoya (Bouvet Island), Southern Ocean, While other colonies have been extensively studied, this remote and second largest global population remains relatively unknown. Time depth recorders and satellite relay data loggers were deployed on breeding females during the 2000-2001 and 2001-2002 Summers. Attendance and foraging patterns were similar to those observed at colonies in the Scotia Sea region where Antarctic krill Euphausia superba is the predominant prey. Early to mid-lactation trips ranged within similar to 100 km of the island, usually towards the west; the dominant direction shifted later in the season and the range also increased markedly to a peak between early February and early March. Solar elevation influenced arrivals and departures from the island, with most departures occurring around sunset. Diurnal variations in diving behaviour were consistent with the vertical migration of krill. Diving frequency was high er at night and diving effort peaked around morning twilight, Afternoon deep diving was common, suggesting that females might target dense daytime krill aggregations between the photic zone and the thermocline. Trip durations increased throughout early to mid-lactation, peaking in late January to early March, before, again decreasing towards the end of lactation. Our results illustrate the substantial variability, both between individuals and within individuals over time, that is likely to reflect variations in prey distribution and in the growth requirements of pups. Such variations need to be taken into account when estimating habitat use and resource utilisation in marine top predators.

However, this approach is not appropriate for assessing temporal variability. The size of krill in the diet of Antarctic fur seals (Arctocephalus gazella) has been shown to provide a good representation of the temporal changes in the krill population structure from within their foraging area. At Cape Shirreff, South Shetland Islands, krill in nets had modal size classes of 46-48 mm and 52-54 mm in length and appeared to reflect the presence of larger krill offshore and smaller krill inshore; krill in the diet of fur seals contained both modes, indicating that the foraging area of fur seals integrated the spatial variability in the krill population. At Signy Island, South Orkney Islands, krill in nets and fur seal diets had a modal size class of 52 mm when sampled simultaneously; however, krill in the diet of seals showed a decline in size later in the season with an overall mode of 48 mm. At Bird Island, South Georgia, there was little overlap between net samples, with a modal size class of 30-40 mm, and fur seal diets, with distinct modes of 44 and 54 mm; and there was also much greater spatial variability in the size of krill in these net samples than in those from the other two locations. Extending the comparison of krill size in the diet of seals, to include spatially congruent net samples collected immediately prior to the CCAMLR 2000 Survey, showed almost complete overlap and indicated an even greater spatial variability in the krill population structure at South Georgia. Interactions between the oceanographic transport and enhanced growth rates of krill at South Georgia may combine to produce a higher degree of spatial variability in the krill population compared to other locations and this may limit the use of differences in krill length as an indicator of their provenance. This study underlines the importance of using data from multiple sources when considering large-scale krill population dynamics; information that is crucial to the effective management of the commercial exploitation of krill.

Length at maturity L(50) is defined as the length at which 50% of the krill stock attains sexual maturity. L(50) values of 34.65-35.91 mm for female krill are the best estimates for the peak spawning season. Males attain sexual maturity later at L(50) values of 43.35-43.71 mm, Length at maturity and length at first spawning are identical for krill. Comparisons with mean length-at-age data show that females mature in the third growth season (age class 2+), while males reach maturity in the fourth year (age class 3+). Both sexes show 'knife-edge maturity'.																	0954-1020					DEC	1994	6	4					479	482		10.1017/S0954102094000726							WOS:A1994QA66500007

Specimens of the same species were collected on the same day from the strandline and sublittoral fringe within the caldera at a bay where these euphausiids had been incapacitated by high temperature geothermally heated waters. Differences between length frequency distributions of samples obtained by both methods were investigated once net-caught specimens had been subject to the simulated effects of geothermally heated waters. Differences between maturity stage/sex ratios for E. superba samples were also assessed. No significant differences between sizes of net-caught or beach-sampled E. crystallorophias were detected, but significant differences were found between both the sizes and sex/maturity stages for E. super ba samples. Possible explanations for these differences are discussed.

Linking Antarctic krill larval supply and recruitment along the Antarctic Peninsula	INTEGRATIVE AND COMPARATIVE BIOLOGY												Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) larval production and overwinter survival drive recruitment variability, which in turn determines abundance trends. The Antarctic Peninsula has been described as a recruitment hot spot and as a potentially important source region for larval and juvenile krill dispersal. However, there has been no analysis to spatially resolve regional-scale krill population dynamics across life stages. We assessed spatiotemporal patterns in krill demography using two decades of austral summer data collected along the North and West Antarctic Peninsula since 1993. We identified persistent spatial segregation in the summer distribution of euphausiid larvae (E. superba plus other species), which were concentrated in oceanic waters along the continental slope, and E. superba recruits, which were concentrated in shelf and coastal waters. Mature females of E. superba were more abundant over the continental shelf than the slope or coast. Euphausiid larval abundance was relatively localized and weakly correlated between the North and West Antarctic Peninsula, while E. superba recruitment was generally synchronized throughout the entire region. Euphausiid larval abundance along the West Antarctic Peninsula slope explained E. superba recruitment in shelf and coastal waters the next year. Given the localized nature of krill productivity, it is critical to evaluate the connectivity between upstream and downstream areas of the Antarctic Peninsula and beyond. Krill fishery catch distributions and population projections in the context of a changing climate should account for ontogenetic habitat partitioning, regional population connectivity, and highly variable recruitment.

In all years the diet was mainly crustaceans, with a small proportion of myctophid fish and trace amounts of cephalopods. Antarctic krill Euphausia superba was the dominant prey item in three years and was replaced by calanoid copepods, especially Rhincalanus gigas and Calanoides acutus, in two years of low krill abundance. Differences in the prey species taken and observations of foraging behaviour suggest that in years of low krill availability Antarctic Prions forage closer inshore, taking copepods by filtering surface water through their palatal lamellae. By switching to feeding on copepods Antarctic Prions are apparently able to maintain a comparable level of reproductive success, unlike most other krill feeding species which suffer much reduced reproductive performance in years of reduced krill availability.																	0158-4197					JUN	1997	97		2				126	132		10.1071/MU97016							WOS:A1997XT91400004

Feeding habits of three seal species at the Danco Coast, Antarctica: a re-assessment	POLAR BIOLOGY												The analysis of prey overlap among Weddell, Antarctic fur and leopard seals was conducted using fecal samples collected at the Danco Coast, Antarctic Peninsula, in 1998 and 2000. The re-occurrence of prey species was moderate in samples collected in 1998, and low in 2000, and reflects resource partitioning among seal species. Prey species that mostly co-occurred in seals' diet were the Antarctic krill Euphausia superba, bivalves, and the myctophids Gymnoscopelus nicholsi and Electrona antarctica. A dietary similarity index of prey overlap has been calculated and demonstrates evident fluctuations in pairwise comparisons between the seal species. The highest and lowest values of prey overlap were observed between Antarctic fur seals and leopard seals, and between Weddell seals and leopard seals, respectively.

Ocean warming threatens southern right whale population recovery	SCIENCE ADVANCES												Whales contribute to marine ecosystem functioning, and they may play a role in mitigating climate change and supporting the Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) population, a keystone prey species that sustains the entire Southern Ocean (SO) ecosystem. By analyzing a five-decade (1971-2017) data series of individual southern right whales (SRWs; Eubalaena australis) photo-identified at Peninsula Valdes, Argentina, we found a marked increase in whale mortality rates following El Nino events. By modeling how the population responds to changes in the frequency and intensity of El Nino events, we found that such events are likely to impede SRW population recovery and could even cause population decline. Such outcomes have the potential to disrupt food-web interactions in the SO, weakening that ecosystem's contribution to the mitigation of climate change at a global scale.

The high-latitude Coastal Antarctic current was characterized by abundance of Euphausia superba larvae.

The slow settling fine particles showed a marked inter-annual variability in biochemical composition with an increase in lipid content as % organic carbon. Comparison of the fatty acid spectra of different size categories of organic particles indicated that fine particles are dominated by saturated, monoenoic and branched acids, while larger material (50-100 mu m, 200-500 mu m net collected fractions) displayed a signature dominated by polyunsaturated acids. Zooplankton taxa displayed different strategies of lipid accumulation. Lipid content was highest in Thysanoessa macrura females and copepodite stages of Calanus propinquus. Relatively low levels were recorded for juveniles and male stages of euphausiids. Reserve lipids varied with species: C. propinquus showed equal content of triglycerides and wax esters, T. macrura showed a dominance of wax esters and Euphausia superba and Themisto gaudichaudii accumulated only triglycerides. Computed as carbon equivalent and integrated over 200 m, lipids in slow settling particles represented 22.6% of annual primary production. Similar computation with mesozooplankton and E. superba data on biomass and population structure from several summer cruises indicated values of carbon accumulation as Lipid reserves and egg production of 4.2 and 0.1% of annual primary production for copepods and 4.4 and 3.8% for E. superba. When all trophic levels are considered, the overall mean exceeded 30% of annual primary production.																	0924-7963					NOV	1998	17	1-4					391	410		10.1016/S0924-7963(98)00051-7							WOS:000077463500027

The trophodynamics of Southern Ocean Electrona (Myctophidae) in the Scotia Sea	POLAR BIOLOGY												The Scotia Sea is one of the most productive regions of the Southern Ocean, but its surface waters are experiencing a rapid increase in temperature, which may be changing the behaviour and distribution of many myctophids and their prey species. Electrona antarctica and Electrona carlsbergi are two of the most abundant myctophids in the region, but their ecology is poorly understood and their response to ongoing environmental change is difficult to determine. This study investigated spatial and temporal patterns in their abundance, population structure and diets using mid-water trawl nets deployed across the Scotia Sea during spring, summer and autumn. E. antarctica was the most numerically abundant species (0.09-0.21 ind. 1,000 m(-3)), with greatest concentrations occurring in the sea-ice sectors. E. carlsbergi occurred in more northern regions, comprising densities of 0.02-0.11 ind. 1,000 m(-3). There was evidence of seasonal variation in depth distribution, size-related sexual dimorphism and size-specific vertical stratification for both species. Latitudinal trends in sex ratio and female body size were apparent for E. antarctica. Its diet varied between regions, seasons and size classes, but overall, Euphausia superba, Metridia spp. and Themisto gaudichaudii were the dominant prey items. E. carlsbergi appeared not to recruit in the Scotia Sea. Its diet was dominated by copepods, particularly Rhincalanus gigas and Metridia spp., but regional, seasonal and ontogenetic variations were evident. This study contributes to our understanding of how mid-water food webs are structured in the Southern Ocean and their sensitivity to ongoing environmental change.

Due to sorption of the compounds to sinking particles and accumulation in sediments, two benthic fish species (Gobionotothen gibberifrons, Chaenocephalus aceratus) feeding on benthos invertebrates and fish reflected significantly increasing concentrations within a decade (1987-1996), while a benthopelagic species (Champsocephalus gunnari) feeding on krill did not. In the pelagic food chain, lipid normalised concentrations of all compounds increased from Antarctic krill to fish proving that biomagnification of highly lipophilic pollutants (log octanol-water partition coefficient > 5) occurs in water-breathing animals. As top predators Weddell and southern elephant seals (Leptonychotes weddellii, Mirounga leonina) biomagnified the persistent organic pollutants relative to krill 30-160 fold with the exception of hexachlorobenzene, the levels of which were lower than in fish indicating its intense specific elimination.

The Southern Ocean is a net sink for many POPs, with a key contribution of the settling fluxes of POPs bound to organic matter (biological pump). However, little is known about POP transfer through the food web in the Southern Ocean and Antarctic waters, where krill is an important ecological node. In this study, we assessed the occurrence of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and furans (PCDD/Fs), polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) from the Bellingshausen, South Scotia and Weddell Seas around the Antarctic Peninsula. The concentrations of PCDD/Fs, PBDEs and PCBs in krill showed a large variability and the average were higher (generally within a factor 3) than those previously reported for eastern Antarctica. This result highlights regional differences related to atmospheric transport and deposition, and also probable regional sources due to human activities. Bioaccumulation and biomagnification factors for PCBs in krill were estimated using previously reported phytoplankton and seawater concentrations for this region. These suggested a near water-krill equilibrium for PCBs, which was not observed for water-phytoplankton partitioning. The estimated removal settling fluxes of PCBs due to the biological pump were several orders ofmagnitude higher than the estimated fluxes of PCBs transferred from phytoplankton to krill.

Both species are carnivorous and prey on mesozooplankton. They represent a substantial food source for marine vertebrates and are a key link between zooplankton secondary production and higher trophic levels. We present data on the total lipid content, lipid class and fatty acid composition of T. libellula and T. abyssorum from northern Fram Strait and the central Arctic Ocean. Both species had moderate to high lipid contents of 14-42% of body dry mass. In T. abyssorum, total lipid content was correlated to body mass, while T. libellula showed sex-related differences in lipid content. Despite their smaller body size, females of T. libellula had higher lipid contents than males. Wax esters represented the major lipid class in both species with 41-43% of total lipid, while triacylglycerols contributed 23-32%. The fatty acid composition was dominated by the long-chain polyunsaturated moieties 20:5(n-3) and 22:6(n-3), short-chain saturated compounds (16:0 and 14:0) and monounsaturated fatty acids of varying length, i.e. 16:1(n-7), 20:1(n-9), 18:1(n-9) and 22:1(n-11). Species-specific and geographic variations in the fatty acid and alcohol patterns were apparently linked to differences in diet and life-cycle. High amounts of the fatty acids and alcohols 20:1(n-9) and 22:1(n-11) in T. libellula indicate predation on herbivorous Calanus copepodids. In addition. elevated levels of 20:5(n-3) in T. libellula indicate a close connection with ice-algal production and the importance of cryo-pelagic coupling processes (i.e. exchange processes between the sea ice and the pelagic communities) for the nutrition of this high-Arctic epipelagic species. In contrast, T. abyssorum is characterised by lower amounts of 20:5(n-3) and its biomarker ratios indicate a higher trophic level.

A Bayesian hierarchical model of Antarctic fur seal foraging and pup growth related to sea ice and prey abundance	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS												We created a Bayesian hierarchical model (BHM) to investigate ecosystem relationships between the physical ecosystem (sea ice extent), a prey measure (krill density), predator behaviors (diving and foraging effort of female Antarctic fur seals, Arctocephalus gazella, with pups) and predator characteristics (mass of maternal fur seals and pups). We collected data on Antarctic fur seals from 1987/1988 to 1994/1995 at Seal Island, Antarctica. The BHM allowed us to link together predators and prey into a model that uses all the data efficiently and accounts for major sources of uncertainty. Based on the literature, we made hypotheses about the relationships in the model, which we compared with the model outcome after fitting the BHM. For each BHM parameter, we calculated the mean of the posterior density and the 95% credible interval. Our model confirmed others' findings that increased sea ice was related to increased krill density. Higher krill density led to reduced dive intensity of maternal fur seals, as measured by dive depth and duration, and to less time spent foraging by maternal fur seals. Heavier maternal fur seals and lower maternal foraging effort resulted in heavier pups at 22 d. No relationship was found between krill density and maternal mass, or between maternal mass and foraging effort on pup growth rates between 22 and 85 days of age. Maternal mass may have reflected environmental conditions prior to the pup provisioning season, rather than summer prey densities. Maternal mass and foraging effort were not related to pup growth rates between 22 and 85 d, possibly indicating that food was not limiting, food sources other than krill were being used, or differences occurred before pups. reached age 22 d.

Effects of variability in prey abundance on reproduction and foraging in chinstrap penguins (Pygoscelis antarctica)	JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY												Life-history theory predicts that adults of long-lived species such as seabirds should optimally balance investment in current and future offspring. However, when trying to optimize investment in offspring provisioning, the most energetically costly component of seabird parental care, adults need to contend with large interannual fluctuations in prey availability and hence the cost of chick provisioning. Adults faced with this uncertainty can mechanistically balance parental care by adopting a strategy somewhere along the continuum between maintaining constant investment in foraging effort between years and letting chick provisioning fluctuate or holding chick provisioning constant and varying investment in foraging effort. Using ship-based hydroacoustic assessment of prey, time-depth recorders attached to penguins and land-based observations at the breeding colony, we examined how foraging and reproductive effort in breeding chinstrap penguins Pygoscelis antarctica responded to interannual variation in the abundance of Antarctic krill Euphausia superba in the vicinity of Seal Island, South Shetland Islands, 1990-1992. Regional measures of krill density varied by a factor of 2.5 (47.0, 23.8 and 61.2 g m(-2) in 1990, 1991 and 1992, respectively) and was correlated with annual measures of breeding adult body weight and reproductive performance (breeding population size, duration of chick rearing, chick growth, breeding success and fledgling weight). In contrast, measures of penguin foraging effort (dive depth, dive duration, number of trips day(-1), trip duration, number of dives trip(-1) and dive rate) did not differ between years. We conclude that chinstrap penguins reduce reproductive success rather than increase foraging effort in response to decreases in prey abundance in a manner consistent with predictions of life-history strategies for long-lived seabirds.

Using three decades of satellite and field data, we document that ocean biological productivity, inferred from chlorophyll a concentration (Chl a), has significantly changed along the WAP shelf. Summertime surface Chl a (summer integrated Chl a similar to 63% of annually integrated Chl a) declined by 12% along the WAP over the past 30 years, with the largest decreases equatorward of 63 S and with substantial increases in Chl a occurring farther south. The latitudinal variation in Chl a trends reflects shifting patterns of ice cover, cloud formation, and windiness affecting water-column mixing. Regional changes in phytoplankton coincide with observed changes in krill (Euphausia superba) and penguin populations.

J	Thanassekos, S; Cox, MJ; Reid, K				Thanassekos, Stephane; Cox, Martin J.; Reid, Keith			Investigating the Effect of Recruitment Variability on Length-Based Recruitment Indices for Antarctic Krill Using an Individual-Based Population Dynamics Model	PLOS ONE												Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba; herein krill) is monitored as part of an on-going fisheries observer program that collects length-frequency data. A krill feedback management programme is currently being developed, and as part of this development, the utility of data-derived indices describing population level processes is being assessed. To date, however, little work has been carried out on the selection of optimum recruitment indices and it has not been possible to assess the performance of length-based recruitment indices across a range of recruitment variability. Neither has there been an assessment of uncertainty in the relationship between an index and the actual level of recruitment. Thus, until now, it has not been possible to take into account recruitment index uncertainty in krill stock management or when investigating relationships between recruitment and environmental drivers. Using length-frequency samples from a simulated population - where recruitment is known - the performance of six potential length-based recruitment indices is assessed, by exploring the index-to-recruitment relationship under increasing levels of recruitment variability (from +/- 10% to +/- 100% around a mean annual recruitment). The annual minimum of the proportion of individuals smaller than 40 mm (F40 min, %) was selected because it had the most robust index-to-recruitment relationship across differing levels of recruitment variability. The relationship was curvilinear and best described by a power law. Model uncertainty was described using the 95% prediction intervals, which were used to calculate coverage probabilities and assess model performance. Despite being the optimum recruitment index, the performance of F40 min degraded under high (>50%) recruitment variability. Due to the persistence of cohorts in the population over several years, the inclusion of F40 min values from preceding years in the relationship used to estimate recruitment in a given year improved its accuracy (mean bias reduction of 8.3% when including three F40 min values under a recruitment variability of 60%).																	1932-6203					DEC 3	2014	9	12							e114378	10.1371/journal.pone.0114378							WOS:000349128700109	25470296

Krill larvae, copepods and the microbial food web: interactions during the Antarctic fall	AQUATIC MICROBIAL ECOLOGY												Experiments were run in the Antarctic Bellinghausen Sea during the austral fall to ascertain the interactive effects of krill larvae (furcilia) and copepods on the microbial food web. A cross-classified design with addition of the small cyclopoid copepod Oithona similis and either the furcilia larvae of Euphausia superba or the calanoid copepod Metridia gerlachei to the natural planktonic community was used, as well as a single experiment with varying densities of O. similis. The experiments showed furcilia to have much higher grazing rates on copepods and ciliates than on algae, with positive selection for ciliates that was not influenced by the presence or absence of O. similis. M gerlachei had a grazing impact on ciliates that was much less than that of furcilia larvae, but due to a high taxonomic resolution of the ciliate community it could be shown that there were groups of grazing-vulnerable and -resistant forms. Contrary to expectations, O. similis had very low grazing rates on both ciliates and algae, but here too grazing-vulnerable and -resistant groups of ciliates could be distinguished. Neither the very strong impact of furcilia on ciliates, copepods and algae nor the more moderate impact of M gerlachei cascaded down to heterotrophic and phototrophic nanoplankton or to bacteria. At least at the time of our experiments, ciliates were tightly bound to the 'classic' aquatic food web, but do not serve to transmit atrophic cascade from the classic and microbial food webs.																	0948-3055					JAN 19	2007	46	1					1	13		10.3354/ame046001							WOS:000244194200001

Isotopic niches of sympatric Gentoo and Chinstrap Penguins: evidence of competition for Antarctic krill?	POLAR BIOLOGY												As climate change, among other factors, is increasingly affecting Antarctic marine systems, competition for prey may increase between predators, particularly in the Antarctic Peninsula which has warmed more than elsewhere. Under such a context, we tested the feeding and trophic ecology of Gentoo (Pygoscelis papua) and Chinstrap (Pygoscelis antarctica) penguins breeding in sympatry at Livingston Island (Antarctic Peninsula) in a single season. We compared the diets of adults (from faecal samples, and stable isotopes in feathers and blood) and chicks (from stomach contents, and stable isotopes in down feathers, toenails and muscles of chicks that had died of unknown causes). Antarctic hill Euphausia superba dominated the diet of both species, although Gentoo Penguins fed on larger Antarctic hill than did Chinstrap Penguins. Stable isotope analyses of adult tissues revealed that both species fed at different niches in successive years, as depicted by the different levels delta C-13 in feathers (showing values from the previous breeding season) and whole blood (showing values from the current season). Tissues collected from chicks confirmed their diet over different time scales (i.e. days to weeks): Gentoo Penguins fed at a higher trophic level (possibly due to a more varied diet) and in different habitats than Chinstrap Penguins, providing evidence of isotopic niche separation of penguins. Our results may be relevant to the monitoring programmes of the Convention on the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR) and suggest that adult scats, and stomach contents and tissues of recently died chicks, can be used in such programmes				Seco, Jose/AAS-4612-2020; Ramos, Jaime A./B-6616-2018; Paiva, Vitor H./J-1092-2019; Ceia, Filipe R./A-2196-2012	Seco, Jose/0000-0002-7957-6488; Ramos, Jaime A./0000-0002-9533-987X; Paiva, Vitor H./0000-0001-6368-9579; Ceia, Filipe R./0000-0002-5470-5183; Dimitrijevic, Danijela/0000-0002-1311-0474; /0000-0002-9621-6660												0722-4060	1432-2056				SEP	2018	41	9					1655	1669		10.1007/s00300-018-2306-5							WOS:000447600600001

R.; Quillfeldt, Petra; Sabat, Pablo			Temporal variation in isotopic composition of Pygoscelis penguins at Ardley Island, Antarctic: Are foraging habits impacted by environmental change?	POLAR BIOLOGY												Several studies have suggested that penguins are undergoing a major restructuring of their feeding habits and distribution after drastic climatic changes in the Antarctic Peninsula region. With the objective of estimating potential medium-term and inter-annual variations in trophic niche, we measured delta N-15 and delta C-13 in feather samples of pygoscelid penguins from museum specimens (1982-1984) and in blood and feather samples from 2009/10-2011 collected from animals on Ardley Island. Current penguin feathers had lower delta C-13 and delta N-15 values and were more similar to Antarctic krill values, than feathers in 1982-1984 and blood from 2009/10-2011. Moreover, delta C-13 and delta N-15 values from museum feathers and modern samples occupied a larger isotopic space in Gentoo Penguins (Pygoscelis papua), compared to Ad,lie Penguins (Pygoscelis adeliae) and Chinstrap Penguins (Pygoscelis antarctica). Our results from feathers samples indicated that penguins have decreased their consumption of fish and other prey of higher trophic levels in the early interbreeding period (EIBP), while increasing the amount of euphausiids (Antarctic krill Euphausia superba) taken. The isotopic values of the species suggest that foraging sites varied significantly over time and seasonally. We suggest that environmental changes may have modified the feeding habits of pygoscelid penguins, resulting in changed foraging behaviour in the EIBP, and altering the secondary prey consumption. Prey choice in breeding pygoscelid species is probably limited by the foraging range around the breeding colony and competitive exclusion between congeners.

Until now, information on important environmental factors affecting its distribution as well as on foraging behaviour is limited. In austral summer 1998, 12 crabeater seals of both sexes and different age classes were equipped with satellite-linked dive recorders at Drescher Inlet (72.85A degrees S, 19.26A degrees E), eastern Weddell Sea. To identify suitable habitat conditions within the Weddell Sea, a maximum entropy (Maxent) modelling approach was implemented. The model revealed that the eastern and southern Weddell Sea is especially suitable for crabeater seals. Distance to the continental shelf break and sea ice concentration were the two most important parameters in modelling species distribution throughout the study period. Model predictions demonstrated that crabeater seals showed a dynamic response to their seasonally changing environment emphasized by the favoured sea ice conditions. Crabeater seals utilized ice-free waters substantially, which is potentially explained by the comparatively low sea ice cover of the Weddell Sea during summer 1998. Diving behaviour was characterized by short (> 90 % = 0-4 min) and shallow (> 90 % = 0-51 m) dives. This pattern reflects the typical summer and autumn foraging behaviour of crabeater seals. Both the distribution and foraging behaviour corresponded well with the life history of the Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba), the preferred prey of crabeater seals. In general, predicted suitable habitat conditions were congruent with probable habitats of krill, which emphasizes the strong dependence on their primary prey.

Six experimental diets were prepared using a low-temperature FM diet as control. The other diets included northern krill where 20, 40 or 60% of the dietary FM protein was replaced with protein from northern krill, and two diets where the FM protein was replaced with protein from Antarctic krill or Arctic amphipod at 40% protein replacement level. All diets were iso-nitrogenous and iso-caloric. Atlantic salmon grew from 410 g to approximately 1500 g during the 160 day experiment, and Atlantic halibut grew from 345 g to 500-600 g during the 150 day experiment. Inclusion of krill in the diets enhanced specific. c growth rate in salmon, especially during the first 100 days (P < 0.01), and in a dose-response manner in halibut for over the 150 day feeding period (P < 0.05). Feed conversion ratio did not differ between dietary treatments, and no difference was found in dry matter digestibility, protein digestibility and fish muscle composition. Good growth rates, blood parameters within normal ranges and low mortalities in all experimental treatments indicted that fish health was not affected either Atlantic salmon or Atlantic halibut fed the various zooplankton diets.

Role of krill versus bottom-up factors in controlling phytoplankton biomass in the northern Antarctic waters of South Georgia	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												The extent to which Antarctic phytoplankton stocks are controlled by 'bottom-up' and/or 'top-down' factors is highly variable. Here we consider data collected at South Georgia during 3 summer surveys that recorded substantial hydrographic variability. A suite of bottom-up and top-down controlling factors were measured simultaneously at the mesoscale. Sea surface temperature varied by >2 degrees C, macronutrients ranged from near-winter concentrations to near-depleted, while mean densities of a major grazer, krill Euphausia superba, varied between near-zero and >400 g wet mass m(-2). A general linear model was used to identify the main factors implicated in the observed differences in phytoplankton biomass. Despite east-to-west and on- to off-shelf temperature gradients, temperature per se was not implicated in phytoplankton variability. Also, while there was an abundance of NO3-N in surface waters, NH4-N was the key nutrient throughout. A domed relationship between phytoplankton and krill peaked between 2 and 4 mg chlorophyll a m(-3) and 6 and 30 g krill m(-2). The positive side of this dome was represented by the west off-shelf region downstream of South Georgia. Here, an ample supply of micro- and macronutrients promoted high primary production, and low densities of krill presumably had little grazing effect, This positive relationship between krill and phytoplankton biomasses was interpreted as krill accumulating in areas of good feeding conditions. The negative side of the dome was typified by the east off-shelf region, where macronutrients remained high, primary production rates were low, and krill densities were very high. The grazing rates calculated here suggested that krill affect their food stocks severely, and the negative krill-phytoplankton relationship in this region may reflect locally high krill densities driving down their food supply.

To examine their foraging strategy, we studied foraging trip patterns and diving behaviour of chinstrap penguins breeding at Signy Island, Antarctica, using time-depth recorders. Foraging trips of penguins could be divided into 2 groups, short diurnal (7.8 h) and longer overnight (19.9 h) trips, with diurnal trips (74%) being dominant in number (263 out of 355 trips). The diving depths of our study birds were much deeper (to 179 m) than previous studies on this species, with modal maximum dive depth at around 90 to 100 m. Diving patterns and profiles included typical pelagic dives, but also included series of consecutive square-wave shaped dives reaching similar maximum depth, the typical characteristics of benthic dives. These benthic-type dives were more abundant in diurnal foraging trips than overnight trips. Analysis of stomach contents showed that penguins on both types of trip fed almost exclusively on Antarctic krill. There was a positive relationship between indices of the proportion of benthic feeding and of foraging efficiency (stomach content mass divided by foraging trip duration). These results highlight the potential importance of benthic feeding on Antarctic krill, the first such recorded instance for chinstrap penguins. This previously undescribed foraging strategy by one of the major avian consumers of Antarctic krill provides a new insight into the predator-prey interactions of the Antarctic coastal marine ecosystem.

Distribution, abundance and ecological relevance of pelagic fishes in the Lazarev Sea, Southern Ocean	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												The distribution and abundance of larval and postlarval fishes was investigated in the Lazarev Sea, Southern Ocean, in March and April 2004. The upper 200 m of the water column were sampled with an 8 m(2) rectangular midwater trawl at 93 stations. The larval species community clustered in a diverse coastal community with high densities of Antarctic silverfish Pleuragramma antarcticum larvae and a less diverse offshore community dominated by Antarctic jonasfish Notolepis coatsi and the lanternfish Electrona antarctica. No postlarval fish were caught in coastal areas. The offshore community of postlarval fishes consisted of the deep-sea smelt Bathylagus antarcticus, and the lanternfishes Gymnoscopelus braueri, G. nicholsi and E. antarctica. The latter species clearly dominated, occurring at mean individual and wet mass densities of 0.17 individuals m(-2) and 0.26 g m(-2), respectively. A generalized additive model significantly related the density of postlarval E. antarctica to the abundance of Antarctic krill Euphausia superba, ocean depth and sea surface temperature. The diet of E. antarctica was dominated by copepods and euphausiid larvae. Mean energy density of E. antarctica in the upper 200 m was 2.8 kJ m(-2), which is equivalent to 36% of the energy stored in Antarctic krill stocks and probably would be considerably higher if a greater depth range were considered. This suggests that E. antarctica is a major energy transmitter in the food web of the Lazarev Sea, challenging the classical krill-dominated food web paradigm of the Southern Ocean.

Environmental drivers of the physiological condition of mature female Antarctic krill during the spawning season: implications for krill recruitment	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												Southern Ocean pelagic productivity relies on the abundance of Antarctic krill Euphausia superba, which fluctuates on a 5-7 yr cycle and is driven by interannual variability in recruitment. The western Antarctic Peninsula (wAP) is home to a significant proportion of the circum-Antarctic krill biomass and is the focus of the krill fishery. The wAP is warming at a rate quicker than most other places on Earth, with notable regional changes in the pelagic ecosystem. There is a major gap in our understanding of how environmental variability affects the reproductive success of krill. We used historical krill population data collected at the wAP (January 1993-2008, Palmer Antarctica Long Term Ecological Research) to assess the effects of environmental variability on the condition of mature female krill during the spawning season and its relationship with krill recruitment. Mature female krill condition during the spawning season was positively correlated with recruitment the subsequent year. Results of generalized additive models indicated that the predominant drivers of krill condition during the spawning season were climatological (Southern Annular Mode and Multivariate El Nino Southern Oscillation Index), though the timing of sea ice advance and retreat, and diatom concentrations were also important Gaining a better understanding of the oceanographic and climatological factors that affect the physiological condition of mature female krill is critical for predicting future demographic patterns and responses to change. Results from our study emphasize the importance of including the effects of climate change in the management models for the Antarctic krill fishery.																	0171-8630	1616-1599				JUL 8	2021	669						65	82		10.3354/meps13720							WOS:000672774400005

Each of these trophic types is represented in the family of the Nototheniidae, represented by 8 species in our investigations. Interspecific competition among the fish species studied appears to be reduced by the vertical structure of their habitat. Food distribution overlap is only slight among fish species with similar feeding styles and behaviours, although krill (Euphausia superba Dana 1852) is almost always an important component of the food supply.																	0944-1921						1994	42	1					17	34									WOS:A1994NP71600002						
J	NORMAN, FI; WARD, SJ				NORMAN, FI; WARD, SJ			FOODS AND ASPECTS OF GROWTH IN THE ANTARCTIC PETREL AND SOUTHERN FULMAR BREEDING AT HOP ISLAND, RAUER-GROUP, EAST ANTARCTICA	EMU												Foods of adult Antarctic Petrels Thalassoica antarctica and Southern Fulmars Fulmarus glacialoides breeding on Hop Island, Rauer Group, East Antarctica, were obtained using water-offloading techniques, from late incubation to late post-guard periods. Both species took mainly krill, particularly Euphausia superba, and fish, almost entirely Pleuragramma antarcticum; other crustaceans and cephalopods were infrequent. The increase of E. crystallorophias, particularly in Southern Fulmars, was associated with increased P. antarcticum in the diet of both species. No significant differences in prey sizes were detected but the smaller Antarctic Petrel tended to contain more fish and less krill. Results are compared with previous studies; all show a restricted number of prey species, and a wide range of prey sizes. Variations in proportions of specific groups may reflect sampling methods, but more likely reflect prey abundance or availability. The importance of ice cover is discussed. Inshore feeding by Southern Fulmars, and differing feeding methods, may allow segregation of foraging: assuming similar rates of digestion, the more digested food in Antarctic Petrels suggests a greater foraging range. This is supported by differences in attendance shifts at nests. Growth rates of chicks deprived a meal were compared with those of chicks given supplementary meals, and controls. Deprivation apparently caused no immediate effects; additional meals tended to increase growth of Antarctic Petrel chicks. Small sample sizes confounded interpretation but suggested that Antarctic Petrels, which typically breed further south than Southern Fulmars, are better adapted to local conditions where sympatric with Southern Fulmars. The slightly larger volumes of oil retrieved with Antarctic Petrel food supports this since oil offers a more efficient method of transporting food to growing chicks. For these two fulmarine petrels, segregation of food requirements may be by foraging differences; where sympatric, segregation of peak demands may also result from separation of laying periods.																	0158-4197					DEC	1992	92		4				207	222		10.1071/MU9920207							WOS:A1992KG65300002

Antarctic Peninsula. Species composition suggested the area was a faunal transition zone between oceanic and nearshore communities. In a comparison between the study area and two oceanic areas, four of the top five numerically dominant species were identical (Euphausia superba, Salpa thompsoni, Thysanoessa macrura and Sagitta gazellae). In the nearshore region a mysid (Antarctomysis ohlinii) replaced the oceanic chaetognath Euhrohnia hamata in numerical ranking. E. superba was primarily responsible for the much higher nearshore biomass values when compared with those of oceanic regions (52.6 vs 2.4-3.1 g DM/m(2)). The ctenophore Callianira antarctica, the mysid A. ohlinii, and the pelagic notothemid fish Pleuragramma antarcticum were important neritic biomass species. Some oceanic species, notably S. thompsoni and the mesopelagic fish Electrona antaretica, were also important contributors to total micronektonic biomass. Fish predation by P. antarcticum and E. antaretica on E. superba (assuming constant fish and krill populations through the season that was sampled, the austral fall (90 d), and using our daily consumption values) is estimated at 2.5% and 2.9% of the total krill numbers, respectively, mostly on the juvenile segment of the population. Krill densities vary considerably in time and space, while available data suggest that pelagic fishes show less seasonal and spatial change. The most likely explanation for those observations is that the fishes are reliably more vulnerable to sampling gear than krill, but it also implies a consistent low level of fish predation on krill throughout the year, particularly on juveniles.

J	Pakhomov, EA				Pakhomov, EA			Salp/krill interactions in the eastern Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY												Spatial distribution and feeding ecophysiology of the Antarctic krill, Euphausia superba, and the tunicate, Salpa thompsoni, were investigated along the 6degreesE meridian between 49 and 65degreesS. Krill and salps displayed pronounced spatial segregation along the transect. Salps clearly dominated north of the 56degreesS parallel, while krill dominated south of it. Overlap in krill/salp distribution occurred only at approximate to56degreesS. This region coincided with the northernmost expansion of the subsurface cold water layer and with the Winter Ice Edge (WIE) region suggesting a clear biotopical separation of these key-stone species in the Antarctic pelagic food web. Krill and salp grazing rates determined using the in situ gut fluorescence technique were low (<1% of daily primary production) to moderate (<25%) in the areas south and north of the WIE region. However, in the region of their overlap, krill and salps alone consumed up to 86% of daily primary production. Assuming that all faecal pellets produced sink, krill and salp would be able to re-package and remove from surface layers <2%, up to 37% and 3-12% of primary production per day in the regions south, within and north of the WIE, respectively. In real terms, krill/salp mediated in situ carbon flux range from 0.01 to 3.7 and from 9.6 to 23.8 mg C m(-2)d(-1) south and north of the WIE region, respectively, and would be as high as 48 mg C m(-2)d(-1) in the WIE region.

Complementary use of stable isotopes and fatty acids for quantitative diet estimation of sympatric predators, the Antarctic pack-ice seals	OECOLOGIA												The quantitative use of stable isotopes (SIs) for trophic studies has seen a rapid growth whereas fatty acid (FA) studies remain mostly qualitative. We apply the Bayesian tool MixSIAR to both SI and FA data to estimate the diet of three sympatric predators: the crabeater (Lobodon carcinophaga), Weddell (Leptonychotes weddellii) and leopard seal (Hydrurga leptonyx). We used SI data of their vibrissae and FA data of their outer blubber to produce comparable diet estimates for the same individuals. Both SI and FA models predicted the same main diet components, although the predicted proportions differed. For the crabeater seal, both methods identified krill, Euphausia superba, as the main, and almost exclusive, food item, although the FA model estimated a slightly lower proportion, potentially due to the low lipid content of krill compared to the fish species used in the model. For the Weddell seal the FA model identified the fish Pleuragramma antarcticum as the most important prey, whereas the SI model was not able to distinguish among prey species, identifying a 'fish-squid' group as the main diet component. For the leopard seal, both models identified krill as the main contributor; however, the predicted proportions for the secondary sources differed. Although vibrissae and outer blubber may not represent the same timeframe, the use of MixSIAR with FA data provides diet estimates comparable to those obtained with SI data, thus, both approaches were complimentary. The use of both biotracers offers a feasible option to study diets of wild animals in a quantitative manner.																	0029-8549	1432-1939															10.1007/s00442-021-05045-z		OCT 2021					WOS:000705695500003	34626270

Linking predator and prey behaviour: contrasts between Antarctic fur seals and macaroni penguins at South Georgia	MARINE BIOLOGY												Antarctic fur seals Arctocephalus gazella and macaroni penguins Eudyptes chrysolophus are the two main land-based krill Euphausia superba consumers in the northern Scotia Sea. Using a combination of concurrent at-sea (predator observations, net hauls and multi-frequency acoustics), and land-based (animal tracking and diet analysis) techniques, we examined variability in the foraging ecology of these sympatric top predators during the austral summer and autumn of 2004. Krill availability derived from acoustic surveys was low during summer, increasing in autumn. During the breeding season, krill occurred in 80% of fur seal diet samples, with fish remains in 37% of samples. Penguin diets contained the highest proportion of fish in over 20 years of routine monitoring (46% by mass; particularly the myctophid Electrona antarctica), with krill (33%) and amphipods (Themisto gaudichaudii; 21%) also occurring. When constrained by the need to return and feed their offspring both predator species foraged to the northwest of South Georgia, consistent with an area of high macrozooplankton biomass, but fur seals were apparently more successful at exploiting krill. When unconstrained by chick-rearing (during March) penguins foraged close to the Shag Rocks shelf-break, probably exploiting the high daytime biomass of fish in this area. Penguins and seals are able to respond differently to periods of reduced krill abundance (in terms of variability in diet and foraging behaviour), without detriment to the breeding success of either species. This highlights the importance of myctophid fish as an alternative trophic pathway for land-based predators in the Scotia Sea ecosystem.

The pattern of exploitation has shifted from one group of resources to another. The recent efforts of the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources are considered in relation to management of finfish exploitation and to the development of a scientifically based management plan for krill. Special emphasis is given to the data required for the effective management of the krill fishery, per se, given the current limited knowledge of the potential yield of the resource and in the face of uncertainty concerning key aspects of the species' biology/ecology. A recent South African initiative aimed at developing a practical management strategy for the Antarctic krill resource is described.																	0257-7615						1991	10						321	339									WOS:A1991GP22400029

Determination of uptake of metals and hypothesis testing for differences that could be attributed to contamination required the establishment of baseline metal concentrations in P. walkeri. Baseline metal concentrations from two reference locations in the Windmill lslands are presented here. P. walkeri was a found to be a sensitive bioaccumulating organism that recorded spatial and temporal variability at the reference sites. Measurement of metals in P. walkeri required the development of a simple digestion procedure that used concentrated nitric acid. For the first time, rare earth metals were determined with additional clean procedures required to measure ultra low concentrations using magnetic sector ICP-MS.

Here we present experimental evidence that Procellariiform seabirds can use a naturally occurring scented compound, dimethyl sulphide, as an orientation cue, Dimethyl sulphide has been studied intensely for its role in regulating global climate(8-11) and is produced by phytoplankton in response to zooplankton grazing(12). Zooplankton, including Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba)(13), are in turn eaten by seabirds and other animals(14). Results from controlled behavioural experiments performed at sea show that many Procellariiforms can detect dimethyl sulphide, and that some species (for example, storm petrels) are highly attracted to it. To our knowledge, this constitutes the first evidence that dimethyl sulphide is part of the natural olfactory landscape overlying the southern oceans.																	0028-0836					AUG 24	1995	376	6542					680	682		10.1038/376680ao							WOS:A1995RQ67200058

Trends, cycles, interannual variability for three pelagic species west of the Antarctic Peninsula 1993-2008	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												The Palmer Long Term Ecological Research study region west of the Antarctic Peninsula is experiencing warming and changing seasonal sea ice dynamics. Abundance patterns of 3 species of pelagic secondary producers were analyzed for trends, cycles, range extensions or shifts in the location of highest density, and for changes in population dynamics over a 16 yr period (1993-2008). Species analyzed represented different hydrographic regimes and are known to have contrasting responses to seasonal sea ice dynamics: krill Euphausia superba, seasonal sea ice zone; tunicates Salpa thompsoni, warmer waters with minimal sea ice; and larval Antarctic silverfish Pleuragramma antarcticum, cold continental shelf waters. Cycles were observed in grid-wide abundance and recruitment for E. superba. Maximum grid-wide densities did not decrease, but the location of highest densities shifted southward 200 km, away from Adelie penguin rookeries at the northern end. A distinct change post-1999 was apparent in the frequency of occurrence and abundance of S. thompsoni. Mixtures of krill and salps became common, but neither peak densities nor the frequency of peak years for salps increased. As with Antarctic krill, highest salp densities shifted southward alongshore. Larval P. antarcticum were abundant in the northern coastal region in the early 1990s, but virtually disappeared in that region after 1999/2000. Possible mechanisms underlying these observations include the southerly movement of the sea ice edge during spring, changes in proximity of source populations (salps), and changes in transport pathways (larval P. antarcticum). Patterns are compared to those in the SW Atlantic.				Newberger, Timothy/AAR-7103-2020													0171-8630	1616-1599					2014	515						11	32		10.3354/meps10965							WOS:000345703500002

Box-Behnken Design including independent variables such as extraction time, extraction temperature, and ratio of mixed solvents was used. The optimal conditions for lipids extraction were the use of petroleum ether:ethyl acetate (2.3:1, v/v) with 62 min of extraction at 52 degrees C. Under the optimal conditions, the extraction yields of lipids from Euphausia superba, Penaeuschinesis, Macrobranchium nipponense, and M. rosenbergii were 4.39, 2.80, 2.98, and 3.30%, respectively. Gas chromatographic analysis showed that M. rosenbergii presented the highest level of polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) (48.28%) among the shrimps studied. In addition, the 20:5n3 (EPA) + 22:6n3 (DHA) value (26.43%) was second only to E. superba (31.27%).

Euphausiids, especially Euphausia superba, proved to be a staple food for Adelie penguins irrespective of the ice condition. Body length and maturity-stage compositions of euphausiids were different among seasons, probably reflecting sea-ice condition in summer. The mean body length decreased and maturity regressed during each season in E. superba, which was partly attributable to the selective feeding on large, mature female krill by Adelie penguins. The 1995/1996 year class of E. superba, which was spawned when the sea ice was most developed, was strong and conspicuous in the 1996/1997 and 1997/1998 seasons. This vigor indicates that sea ice provided females with good spawning conditions and larvae with good growth and survival rates.

Marine and terrestrial factors affecting Adelie penguin Pygoscelis adeliae chick growth and recruitment off the western Antarctic Peninsula	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												An individual-based bioenergetics model that simulates the growth of an Adelie penguin Pygoscelis adeliae chick from hatching to fledging was used to assess marine and terrestrial factors that affect chick growth and fledging mass off the western Antarctic Peninsula. Simulations considered the effects on Adelie penguin fledging mass of (1) modification of chick diet through the addition of Antarctic silverfish Pleuragramma antarcticum to an all-Antarctic krill Euphausia superba diet, (2) reduction of provisioning rate which may occur as a result of an environmental stress such as reduced prey availability, and (3) increased thermoregulatory costs due to wetting of chicks which may result from increased precipitation or snow-melt in colonies. Addition of 17% Antarctic silverfish of Age-Class 3 yr (AC3) to a penguin chick diet composed of Antarctic krill increased chick fledging mass by 5%. Environmental stress that results in > 4% reduction in provisioning rate or wetting of just 10% of the chick's surface area decreased fledging mass enough to reduce the chick's probability of successful recruitment. The negative effects of reduced provisioning and wetting on chick growth can be compensated for by inclusion of Antarctic silverfish of AC3 and older in the chick diet. Results provide insight into climate-driven processes that influence chick growth and highlight a need for field research designed to investigate factors that determine the availability of AC3 and older Antarctic silverfish to foraging Adelie penguins and the influence of snowfall on chick wetting, thermoregulation and adult provisioning rate.																	0171-8630	1616-1599					2011	436						273	289		10.3354/meps09242							WOS:000294619800020

The enzymatic resistance and transport of DTDSEEEIR-iron during gastrointestinal digestion and absorption as well as the relationship between the DTDSEEEIR stability and the enhancement of iron absorption were further explored. Results revealed that iron ions spontaneously bound to the carboxyl, hydroxyl, and amino groups of the DTDSEEEIR peptide, which induced the folding of DTDSEEEIR to form a more orderly structure. The DTDSEEEIR peptide remained stable to a certain extent (79.60 +/- 0.19%) after gastrointestinal digestion and the coordination of iron improved the digestive stability of the DTDSEEEIR peptide (93.89 +/- 1.37%). Moreover, the stability of DTDSEEEIR across intestinal epithelium had a positive effect on iron absorption, which implied that DTDSEEEIR might carry iron ions through intestinal epithelial cells.																	0021-8561	1520-5118				OCT 7	2020	68	40					11290	11300		10.1021/acs.jafc.0c03223							WOS:000580512000025	32914618					
J	Hill, SL				Hill, Simeon L.			From strategic ambiguity to technical reference points in the Antarctic krill fishery: the worst journey in the world?	ENVIRONMENTAL CONSERVATION												The goals of ecosystem based management (EBM) are strategically ambiguous, meaning that they require interpretation to identify objectives for ecosystem state. Ecosystem states that are useful for achieving such objectives are known as reference points. Soft reference points specify both a state and a probability of the ecosystem being in that state. They are used with simulation models to identify management measures for which the risk of the ecosystem entering an undesirable state is below a specified level. The Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR) is responsible for the EBM of Antarctic krill fisheries. CCAMLR used soft reference points for the krill stock in the Scotia Sea and southern Drake Passage to set a regional catch limit. However, this catch limit needs spatial subdivision to protect predators from localized depletion. Model-based evaluations of different options for subdividing the catch limit used illustrative reference points to assess the depletion risk to multiple predators. This study demonstrates that the apparent risk is sensitive to the choice of reference point and method for aggregating modelled predators. EBM practitioners and stakeholders need to be aware that these factors could therefore bias comparisons of management measures. Nonetheless, qualitative distinctions between different spatial subdivision options are relatively consistent except at high levels of aggregation and extreme reference points. This study also demonstrates a lack of generality in the relationship between current and future ecosystem state. Thus, the EBM goal of maintaining ecosystem resilience implies different reference points for the current state of different ecosystem components. Despite early progress in defining soft reference points for the krill stock, CCAMLR has not yet defined reference points for krill predators. Structured dialogue aimed at identifying collective objectives might be necessary to achieve further progress in CCAMLR and other EBM organizations.

J	Muhlebach, A; Albers, C; Kattner, G				Muhlebach, A; Albers, C; Kattner, G			Differences in the sterol composition of dominant Antarctic zooplankton	LIPIDS												The composition of free sterols was determined in Antarctic zooplankton species with various feeding behaviors. In the Southern Ocean, the dominant calanoid copepods Calanoides acutus, Calanus propinquus, Metridia gerlachei, and Euchaeta antarctica were investigated during different seasons and compared with the euphausiids Euphausia superba, E. crystallorophias, and Thysanoessa macrura. In addition, the Arctic copepods Calanus hyperboreus, C. glacialis, and C. finmarchicus were studied for comparison. Analyses were performed using gas chromatography and mass spectrometry. The zoo; plankton species exhibited a simple sterol content of up to six sterols. In the copepods, cholest-5-en-3 beta-ol (22.1 to 60.5%, range of sample means), cholesta-5,24-dien-3 beta-ol (22.3 to 45.2%), and cholesta-5,22 E-dien-3 beta-ol (4.3 to 33.4%) contributed most, while in euphausiids the sterol composition was less complex with cholest-5-en-3 beta-ol always accounting for more than 75% of the total. Although sterols are membrane constituents and are expected not to vary considerably, differences in the abundance of sterols were observed between the species and the seasons. In herbivorous copepods, cholesta-5,24-dien-3 beta-ol increased by a factor of 1.5 to about 45% during the main feeding period in summer; this sterol is a metabolic precursor of cholest-5-en-3 beta-ol in the process of the dealkylation of dietary C-24 alkylated phytosterols. Cholest-5-en-3 beta-ol decreased by the same proportion. Omnivorous and carnivorous copepods showed average levels of cholesta-5,24-dien-3 beta-ol below 25%. These changes in sterol composition between copepod species seem to reflect their different feeding modes.																	0024-4201					JAN	1999	34	1					45	51		10.1007/s11745-999-336-1							WOS:000078635200007	10188596

A.			Seasonal changes in the diet and feeding behaviour of a top predator indicate a flexible response to deteriorating oceanographic conditions	MARINE BIOLOGY												Shifts in the diet of top predators can be linked to changes in environmental conditions. In this study, we tested relationships between environmental variation and seasonal changes in diet of a top predator, the grey-headed albatross Thalassarche chrysostoma, breeding at Bird Island, South Georgia in an austral summer of 1999/2000. Oceanographic conditions in that year around South Georgia were abnormal (i.e. anomalously high sea surface temperature to a relative 19-year long-term mean). The diet of grey-headed albatrosses showed high seasonal variation, shifting from cephalopods (42.9 % by mass) in late February to Antarctic krill Euphausia superba (58.3 %) in late April, and grey-headed albatrosses breeding performance was low (16.8 %). This study shows these albatrosses did not manage to find sufficient alternative prey and highlight the risk to top predators if there is an increase in the frequency or severity of food shortages in Antarctic waters.

We used a related species, Meganyctiphanes, North Atlantic krill, to visualize the flow field produced by tethered shrimps in an aquarium. In this situation, the propulsion jet flow some centimeters behind the shrimp is surrounded by a vortex ring of recoiling water motion from which, if the vortex is also produced by unrestrained swimming shrimp, a following shrimp hypothetically can draw forces of lift and propulsion to decrease energy expense in long-distance migration. Two antennular sensitivities to water vibration in frequency ranges 5-40 and 40-150 Hz were calibrated, and the activity of connected interneurons was traced into the abdominal pleopod-carrying segments. Water oscillation of 3-10 Hz frequency, applied to the antennules, was shown to entrain a closely synchronous pleopod beat in the stimulated specimens.

J	ARNOULD, JPY; WHITEHEAD, MD				ARNOULD, JPY; WHITEHEAD, MD			THE DIET OF ANTARCTIC PETRELS, CAPE PETRELS AND SOUTHERN FULMARS REARING CHICKS IN PRYDZ BAY	ANTARCTIC SCIENCE												The breeding season diet of the three surface-nesting petrel species on the Rauer Islands, Prydz Bay were examined. The stomach contents of cape petrel (Daption capense), Antarctic petrel (Thalassoica antarctica), and southern fulmar (Fulmarus glacialoides) were sampled by collecting regurgitates and by stomach flushing during the 1987/88 early chick-rearing period. Pleuragramma antarcticum and Euphausia superba dominated the diets of all species. By mass they constituted 78% and 22% of Antarctic petrel diet, 63% and 36% of southern fulmar diet, and 14% and 85% of cape petrel diet respectively. P. antarcticum increased in importance in the diet of Antarctic petrels during the course of the study, while E. superba became increasingly important in the diets of southern fulmars and cape petrels. Previous studies conducted during incubation consistently reported the diets as comprising chiefly cephalopods and euphausiids, whilst studies during chick-rearing have reported fish and euphausiids dominating, and very little cephalopod material.																	0954-1020					MAR	1991	3	1					19	27		10.1017/S0954102091000056							WOS:A1991FB09900004

Samples were collected in October/November 1988 with a multiple RMT1 + 8 net during the European Polarstern Study (EPOS). Multivariate analysis resulted in two distinct site clusters, a northern one mainly located in the open water/marginal ice zone and a southern one extending from the marginal ice zone into the consolidated pack-ice. Clusters were, however, faunistically coherent with a high degree in positive covariation of species. There was no basis for the separation into communities, but differences occurred on the population level in numerical abundances, biomass (wet weight) and in a shift in species dominance. Different ice zones and vertical layers were tested among each other with regard to their relative species abundance. Significant differences were found between the upper 60 m layer of the open sea, the upper 60 m layer of the closed pack-ice and the so called transitional zone. Species richness and diversity was lowest directly under the closed pack-ice. Abundance and biomass was highest in the surface layer of the open water, while both variables decreased dramatically under the ice. Copepods dominated numerically in open water, while salps dominated in biomass. Euphausia superba and Thysanoessa macrura were the dominant species in the upper water column of the closed pack-ice zone. Krill was the only species with increasing abundance in the sub-ice area and a dominance in biomass of more than 91% demonstrated its unique importance for the sub-ice habitat.																	0722-4060					APR	1992	12	1					15	24									WOS:A1992HT73100003

Champsocephalus gunnari fed almost exclusively on krill (Euphausia superba) in all years. The importance of other taxa (Themisto gaudichaudii, mysids, myctophids) in the diet was negligible. The average feeding rate of Champsocephalus gunnari inferred from an exponential gastric evacuation model was between 1.0 and 1.5% body weight per day. Most of the stomachs of Chaenocephalus aceratus were empty. Stomachs with food contained mainly krill, mysids and fish. Among the fish taken, locally abundant species formed the bulk of the diet: Gobionotothen gibberifrons in 2001, Lepidonotothen larseni and Champsocephalus gunnari in 2002 and L. larseni in 2003. An ontogenetic shift in feeding preference of Chaenocephalus aceratus was observed: fish smaller than 30 cm fed on krill and mysids, while larger animals relied primarily on fish.

J	Dahood, A; Watters, GM; de Mutsert, K				Dahood, Adrian; Watters, George M.; de Mutsert, Kim			Using sea-ice to calibrate a dynamic trophic model for the Western Antarctic Peninsula	PLOS ONE												The pelagic ecosystems of the Western Antarctic Peninsula are dynamic and changing rapidly in the face of sustained warming. There is already evidence that warming may be impacting the food web. Antarctic krill, Euphausia superba, is an ice-associated species that is both an important prey item and the target of the only commercial fishery operating in the region. The goal of this study is to develop a dynamic trophic model for the region that includes the impact of the sea-ice regime on krill and krill predators. Such a model may be helpful to fisheries managers as they develop new management strategies in the face of continued sea-ice loss. A mass balanced food-web model (Ecopath) and time dynamic simulations (Ecosim) were created. The Ecopath model includes eight currently monitored species as single species to facilitate its future development into a model that could be used for marine protected area planning in the region. The Ecosim model is calibrated for the years 1996-2012. The successful calibration represents an improvement over existing Ecopath models for the region. Simulations indicate that the role of sea ice is both central and complex. The simulations are only able to recreate observed biomass trends for the monitored species when metrics describing the sea-ice regime are used to force key predator-prey interactions, and to drive the biomasses of Antarctic krill and the fish species Gobionotothen gibberifrons. This model is ready to be used for exploring results from sea-ice scenarios or to be developed into a spatial model that informs discussions regarding the design of marine protected areas in the region.				de Mutsert, Kim/AAV-1035-2020	de Mutsert, Kim/0000-0002-7902-3787; Dahood, Adrian/0000-0001-5346-8537												1932-6203					APR 2	2019	14	4							e0214814	10.1371/journal.pone.0214814							WOS:000462993900041	30939156

The horizontal and vertical scattering layers in the upper 200 m of the water column were known with the existence of predominant ice krill ( > 95%) in this region. Acoustic identification using a two-frequency dB window between S-v at 38 and S-v at 120 kHz separated echoes originating from dominant ice krill from other zooplankton species. The frequency dependence of ice krill at 38 and 120 kHz was examined and the result presented that ice krill might have different acoustic characteristics from other Southern Ocean zooplanlcton species including Euphausia superba. This result could be applied to improve the ability of acoustic identification and precise density estimation of ice krill in the high-latitude coastal waters of Antarctica. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Bengtson, JL; Stewart, BS				Bengtson, JL; Stewart, BS			Diving patterns of a Ross seal (Ommatophoca rossii) near the eastern coast of the Antarctic Peninsula	POLAR BIOLOGY												In January 1987 we documented the diving patterns of a female Ross seal (Ommatophoca rossii) in the marginal pack-ice zone near the eastern coast of the Antarctic Peninsula for 2 days using a microprocessor-based time-depth recorder. The seal hauled out during the day and dived continually when in the water at night. Dives averaged 110 m deep and 6.4 min long; the deepest dive was 212 m and the longest 9.8 min. Dives were deepest near twilight and shallowest at night; this pattern suggests that the seal's prey, presumably midwater squid and fish, may have been making vertical migrations or changing predator-avoidance behavior in response to diel light patterns. The dives of this Ross seal were substantially deeper, on average, than those of crabeater seals (Lobodon carcinophagus), which forage in the same areas on Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba).																	0722-4060					SEP	1997	18	3					214	218		10.1007/s003000050178							WOS:A1997XR39800007

Results from 34 birds showed that foraging penguins with eggs and with brooded and creching chicks spent mean periods away from the nest of 96, 36 and 21 h, respectively, during which time means of 29.0 h (30%), 11.2 h (31%) and 2.7 h (13%), respectively, were spent under water at depths > 5 m. Time under water was positively correlated with time absent from nest. Maximum depth reached was 170 m but overall birds spent most time at shallower depths. Birds foraging for brooded chicks dived deeper than birds foraging for creching chicks. Stomach-pumping indicated that the principal prey caught at this time was krill, Euphausia superba. Mean mass changes of adults during single foraging trips indicated that krill were caught at a mean rate of 7.2 g min-1 spent under water.																	0025-3162						1991	109	2					181	189		10.1007/BF01319385							WOS:A1991FT43700001						
J	Fallon, NG; Fielding, S; Fernandes, PG				Fallon, Niall G.; Fielding, Sophie; Fernandes, Paul G.			Classification of Southern Ocean krill and icefish echoes using random forests	ICES JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE												Target identification remains a challenge for acoustic surveys of marine fauna. Antarctic krill, Euphausia superba, are typically identified through a combination of expert scrutiny of echograms and analysis of differences in mean volume backscattering strengths (S-V; dB re 1 m(-1)) measured at two or more echosounder frequencies. For commonly used frequencies, however, the differences for krill are similar to those for many co-occurring fish species that do not possess swimbladders. At South Georgia, South Atlantic, one species in particular, mackerel icefish, Champsocephalus gunnari, forms pelagic aggregations, which can be difficult to distinguish acoustically from large krill layers. Mackerel icefish are currently surveyed using bottom-trawls, but the resultant estimates of abundance may be biased because of the species' semi-pelagic distribution. An acoustic estimate of the pelagic component of the population could indicate the magnitude of this bias, but first a reliable target identification method is required. To address this, random forests (RFs) were generated using acoustic and net sample data collected during surveys. The final RF classified as krill, icefish, and mixed aggregations of weak scattering fish species with an overall estimated accuracy of 95%. Minimum S-V, mean aggregation depth (m), mean distance from the seabed (m), and geographic positional data were most important to the accuracy of the RF. Time-of-day and the difference between S-V at 120 kHz (S-V 120) and that at 38 kHz (S-V 38) were also important. The RF classification resulted in significantly higher estimates of backscatter apportioned to krill when compared with widely applied identification methods based on fixed and variable ranges of S-V 120-S-V 38. These results suggest that krill density is underestimated when those S-V-differencing methods are used for target identification. RFs are an objective means for target identification and could enhance the utility of incidentally collected acoustic data.

There was no correlation between biomass delta C-13 or delta N-15 with ON content, and consequently both 6(13)C and delta N-15 values were useful in evaluating trophic relationships. delta N-15 values of the fauna ranged from 3.1 to 12.5 parts per thousand, with lowest values recorded in suspension feeders (e.g., bryozoans) and highest values in Adelie penguins (12.5 parts per thousand) collected in 1989. The comparatively lower delta N-15 value for a Chinstrap penguin (6.9 parts per thousand) collected in 1997 is attributed to the different dietary food sources consumed by these species as reflected in their respective delta C-13 values. Significant amounts of benthic macroalgal carbon Is incorporated into the tissues of invertebrates and fishes that occupy up to four trophic levels. For many benthic and epibenthic species, including various crustaceans and molluscs, assimilation of benthic algal carbon through detrital pathways ranges from 30 to 100%. Consequently, the trophic Importance of benthic brown algae may well extend to many pelagic organisms that are key prey species for birds, fishes, and marine mammals. These data support the hypothesis that benthic seaweeeds, together with their associated epiphytic diatoms, provide an important carbon source that is readily incorporated Into Antarctic peninsula food webs.																	0003-1569					FEB	2001	41	1					99	112		10.1668/0003-1569(2001)041[0099:NACMOA]2.0.CO;2							WOS:000172505600009						
J	Hewitt, R				Hewitt, R			An index of per capita recruitment	CCAMLR SCIENCE												An index of per capita recruitment (PCR) is proposed such that PCRy-1 = R1(y)/(1-R1(y))e(M) where R1 is the proportion of age-1 animals sampled in year y and M is the post-recruit mortality rate. The intent of the index is to facilitate investigation of reproductive success and the factors postulated to affect it. The formulation of PCX is based on the assumptions that: (i) post-recruit mortality does not vary over age or between years; (ii) 100% of age-1 animals spawn; (iii) a representative sample of the population is available; and (iv) the proportion of age-1 animals in the sample can be determined unambiguously. Normal, lognormal and uniform probability distributions of R1, and three levels of M were assumed in order to investigate the resulting distributions of PCX. Distributions of PCX are skewed toward higher values such that the dynamic range of PCR is largest with high values of R1; increasing M tends to offset this effect but only slightly: A simple population model was then constructed to test the sensitivity of PCR to relaxation of its underlying assumptions. PCX is not biased relative to recruits per spawner when mortality is constant over all ages and years, and when all age-1 animals spawn. These conclusions are insensitive to changes in the shape of the functional relationship between spawners and recruits. PCR is biased low with age-specific decline in mortality and reduction in the proportion of age-1 spawners. Introducing year-to-year random variability in both mortality and proportion of age-1 spawners resulted in broader distributions of PCX relative to recruits per spawner but did not appear to introduce additional bias. On average, PCR will underestimate recruits per spawner by 30% if reasonable assumptions are made regarding the variability of mortality and the proportion of age-1 spawners. The effectiveness of PCX to track changes in recruits per spawner over time was confirmed by introducing cycles in the shape of the functional relationship between spawners and recruits. PCX was also able to track cycles in recruits per spawner after a 20% random sampling error was added to the value of R1 used in the calculation of PCX and year-to-year random variability in mortality and proportion of age-1 spawners was introduced, although errors were larger. A time series of PCX for Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) sampled in the vicinity of the South Shetland Islands from 1979 to 1998 is presented.																	1023-4063						2000	7						179	196									WOS:000166295500011

Managing this fishery sustainably, against a backdrop of rapid regional climate change, requires information on distribution and time trends. Many data on the abundance of both taxa have been obtained from net sampling surveys since 1926, but much of this is stored in national archives, sometimes only in notebooks. In order to make these important data accessible we have collated available abundance data (numerical density, no. m(-2)) of postlarval E. superba and salp individual (multiple species, and whether singly or in chains). These were combined into a central database, KRILLBASE, together with environmental information, standardisation and metadata. The aim is to provide a temporal-spatial data resource to support a variety of research such as biogeochemistry, autecology, higher predator foraging and food web modelling in addition to fisheries management and conservation. Previous versions of KRILLBASE have led to a series of papers since 2004 which illustrate some of the potential uses of this database. With increasing numbers of requests for these data we here provide an updated version of KRILLBASE that contains data from 15 194 net hauls, including 12 758 with krill abundance data and 9726 with salp abundance data. These data were collected by 10 nations and span 56 seasons in two epochs (1926-1939 and 1976-2016). Here, we illustrate the seasonal, inter-annual, regional and depth coverage of sampling, and provide both circumpolar-and regional-scale distribution maps. Krill abundance data have been standardised to accommodate variation in sampling methods, and we have presented these as well as the raw data. Information is provided on how to screen, interpret and use KRILLBASE to reduce artefacts in interpretation, with contact points for the main data providers.

J	Murphy, EJ; Reid, K				Murphy, EJ; Reid, K			Modelling Southern Ocean krill population dynamics: biological processes generating fluctuations in the South Georgia ecosystem	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												Variability is a key feature of the pelagic ecosystems of the Southern Ocean and an important aspect of the variation is fluctuation in the abundance of krill Euphausia superba Dana, the major prey item of many of the higher predators. Direct impacts of variability in the large-scale physical environment, such as changes in ocean circulation, have been suggested as the main factor generating the observed fluctuations, So far, however, there has been little quantitative assessment of the importance of krill population dynamics in the observed variation. Here, analyses of a model of krill population development and predator diet data from South Georgia have been used to examine seasonal changes in the population structure of krill. The krill population model was combined with a size-based selection function and used to generate expected length-frequency distributions in the predator diet through a summer season. Comparison of the model solutions with the predator diet data indicates that the model can reproduce the observed pattern of variation and emphasizes that adult population changes are a key aspect of the interannual fluctuations observed during some years. Low krill abundance was associated with reduced representation of the 3+ age group (3 to 4 yr old), whereas when krill were abundant the 3+ age class was the major age group present. The seasonal changes in the population structure in the predator diet involve a complex interaction of relative year class strength, timing of immigration, fluctuations in growth rates and dynamic predator-selective effects, Development of the model to examine the interactive effects of changing krill growth and mortality rates will be a valuable next step. The dominance of the changes in krill population age structure underlines the fact that to understand the variability of the South Georgia ecosystem we must identify the major factors generating variability in population dynamics throughout the Scotia Sea.																	0171-8630						2001	217						175	189		10.3354/meps217175							WOS:000170790300016

Seasonal prey switching in non-breeding gentoo penguins related to a wintertime environmental anomaly around South Georgia	POLAR BIOLOGY												Information is needed on how anomalous environmental conditions affect important Antarctic ecological sentinels during the winter. Using a non-invasive method (scats), the diet of non-breeding gentoo penguins Pygoscelis papua at Bird Island, South Georgia, was examined during the winter of 2009 when local environmental conditions were abnormal (e.g. warmer sea surface waters). Scats were collected every 2 weeks from May until October 2009 (N = 168); the diet was dominated by the amphipod Themisto gaudichaudii by frequency of occurrence (77.5% of the samples) and by number (70.5% of the total individuals). By mass, different species of crustaceans (T. gaudichaudii and Antarctic krill Euphausia superba) and fish (Champsocephalus gunnari, Lepidonotothen larseni and Pseudochaenichthys georgianus) were the most important in different periods. Numerically, prey switching occurred at the end of winter, when E. superba became more abundant in the penguins' diets in late September and early October (austral spring), when sea surface temperatures became colder. T. gaudichaudii is sub-optimal prey for gentoo penguins and its consumption most likely reflects a lack of E. superba in local waters. The consumption of T. gaudichaudii and fish, in place of E. superba, was probably insufficient for the penguins to maintain a body condition suitable for reproduction, contributing to the observed late commencement of breeding (i.e. 2-3 weeks) that year. Our results highlight the sensitivity of gentoo penguin populations to variations in environmental conditions, particularly in terms of how these conditions affect the availability of preferred dietary items and potential follow-on effects in the subsequent breeding season.

Oceanic circumpolar habitats of Antarctic krill	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												Surveys of Euphausia superba often target localised shelves and ice edges where their growth rates and predation losses are atypically high. Emphasis on these areas has led to the current view that krill require high food concentrations, with a distribution often linked to shelves. For a wider, circumpolar perspective, we compiled all available net-based density data on postlarvae from 8137 mainly summer stations from 1926 to 2004. Unlike Antarctic zooplankton, the distribution of E. superba is highly uneven, with 70% of the total stock concentrated between longitudes 0 degrees and 90 degrees W. Within this Atlantic sector, krill are abundant over both continental shelf and ocean. At the Antarctic Peninsula they are found mainly over the inner shelf, whereas in the Indian-Pacific sectors krill prevail in the ocean within 200 to 300 km of the shelf break. Overall, 87% of the total stock lives over deep oceanic water (> 2000 m), and krill occupy regions with moderate food concentrations (0.5 to 1.0 mg chl a m(-3)). Advection models suggest some northwards loss from these regions and into the low chlorophyll belts of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC). We found possible evidence for a compensating southwards migration, with an increasing proportion of krill found south of the ACC as the season progresses. The retention of krill in moderately productive oceanic habitats is a key factor in their high total production. While growth rates are lower than over shelves, the ocean provides a refuge from shelf-based predators. The unusual circumpolar distribution of krill thus reflects a balance between advection, migration, top-down and bottom-up processes.																	0171-8630	1616-1599					2008	362						1	23		10.3354/meps07498							WOS:000257849900001

Detection of tropomyosin and determination of proteins in crustacean oils	FOOD CHEMISTRY												Tropomyosin is known to be the main allergen in crustaceans and the objective of this study was to investigate if this protein could be detected in commercial crustacean oils from Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) and the zooplankton Calanus finmarchicus. We also examined the possibility of determining the protein content in the oils by direct amino acid analysis. Western blotting showed that a commercial antibody against shrimp tropomyosin cross-reacted with a protein of similar size in Antarctic krill and C. finmarchicus. The protein tentatively identified as tropomyosin, was also detected in krill oil products, but not in oils from C. finmarchicus. The acetone-heptane method used for extracting proteins in the oils is however not optimal. Other extraction methods should therefore be considered when investigating the presence of allergenic proteins in oils. Direct amino acid analysis on oils should be further explored as a method for determining the total amount of proteins present. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Fishes were the most important prey by mass in 1995 (81.1%) and 1996 (60.5%) while crustaceans predominated in 1993 (70% by mass). Among fishes, species of the family Nototheniidae predominated in the diet with G. gibberifrons the most important prey by mass in 1993 and 1995 and N. nybelini in 1996. Other nototheniid fish such as L. nudifrons and T. newnesi were also well represented in the three sampling periods. Krill (Euphausia superba) was largely the most important prey among the eleven crustacean taxa identified in the samples. A total of 1,628 squid lower beaks was found, 97% identified as Psychroteuthis glacialis. Diet composition in terms of frequency of occurrence, mass and number is compared with previous studies.																	0738-6028						2000	23	3					511	517		10.2307/1522192							WOS:000166519000021

Antarctic krill and salps generally display pronounced spatial segregation at all spatial scales. This appears to be the result of a clear biotopical separation of these key species in the Antarctic pelagic food web. Krill and salps are found in different water masses or water mass modifications, which are separated by primary or secondary frontal features. On the small-scale (<100 km), Antarctic krill and salps are usually restricted to the specific water parcels, or are well segregated vertically. Krill and salp grazing rates estimated using the in situ gut fluorescence technique are among the highest recorded in the Antarctic pelagic food web. Although krill and salps at times may remove the entire daily primary production, generally their grazing impact is moderate (less than or equal to50% of primary production). The regional ecological consequences of years of high salp densities may be dramatic. If the warming trend, which is observed around the Antarctic Peninsula and in the Southern Ocean, continues, salps may become a more prominent player in the trophic structure of the Antarctic marine ecosystem. This likely would be coupled with a dramatic decrease in krill productivity, because of a parallel decrease in the spatial extension of the krill biotope. The high Antarctic regions, particularly the Marginal Ice Zone, have, however, effective physiological mechanisms that may provide protection against the salp invasion. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Because considerable uncertainty surrounds recent estimates of stock size, there is a need to consider novel approaches that may give insight into the population dynamics of this species. We derive two indices of recruitment based on the occurrence of mackerel icefish in gentoo penguin diets, one of which is scaled by a survey estimate of the density of Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba), an alternative prey species for gentoo penguins. The closure of the fishery for much of the 1990s allowed the relationship between environmental conditions and recruitment to be studied without the confounding effects of fishing mortality. The recruitment indices were positively correlated with sea surface temperature with a lag time equal to the age of the fish. These results suggest strong links between mesoscale environmental processes and the smaller scale interaction between gentoo penguins and their mackerel icefish prey.

Spatial niche partitioning may promote coexistence of Pygoscelis penguins as climate-induced sympatry occurs	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION												Climate-induced range overlap can result in novel interactions between similar species and potentially lead to competitive exclusion. The West Antarctic Peninsula (WAP) is one of the most rapidly warming regions on Earth and is experiencing a poleward climate migration from a polar to subpolar environment. This has resulted in a range expansion of the ice-intolerant gentoo penguins (Pygoscelis papua) and a coincident decrease in ice-obligate Adelie penguins (P.adeliae) near Palmer Station, Anvers Island, WAP. Ecologically similar species that share a limited prey resource must occupy disparate foraging niches in order to co-exist. Therefore, we determined the extent of foraging and dietary niche segregation between Adelie and gentoo penguins during the austral breeding season near Palmer Station. This research was conducted across six breeding seasons, from 2009 to 2014, which allowed us to investigate niche overlap in the context of interannual resource variability. Using biotelemetry and diet sampling, we found substantial overlap in the diets of Adelie and gentoo penguins, who primarily consumed Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba); however, our results showed that Adelie and gentoo penguins partitioned this shared prey resource through horizontal segregation of their core foraging areas. We did not find evidence that Antarctic krill were a limiting resource during the breeding season or that climate-induced sympatry of Adelie and gentoo penguins resulted in competition for prey or caused the subsequent differing population trajectories. This apparent absence of resource competition between Adelie and gentoo penguins throughout this study implies that current population trends in this region are governed by other biological and physical factors. Our results highlight the importance of understanding the mechanistic processes that influence top predator populations in the context of climate-driven ecosystem shifts.																	2045-7758					OCT	2018	8	19					9764	9778		10.1002/ece3.4445							WOS:000448803000017	30386573					
J	Zhou, L; Wang, Y; Wang, XL; Liang, Y; Huang, Z				Zhou, Li; Wang, Yan; Wang, Xiaolin; Liang, Yi; Huang, Zheng			Determination of Phosphatidylcholine in Shrimp by High-Resolution Mass Spectrometry	ANALYTICAL LETTERS												The molecular species of phosphatidylcholine from freshwater sources (Macrobranchium nipponense and Macrobranchium rosenbergii) and marine sources (Euphausia superba and Penaeus chinesis) were characterized by high-resolution mass spectrometry. The tandem secondary mass spectrometry (MS/MS) fragmentation allowed for the identification of fatty acyl residues of phosphatidylcholine molecular species. (16:0-18:1)Phosphatidylcholine was the main phosphatidylcholine molecular species determined in all shrimp samples, especially in E. superba. Macrobranchium rosenbergii phosphatidylcholine was particularly rich in (16:0-20:5)phosphatidylcholine and (16:0-22:6)phosphatidylcholine. The proportion of the two molecular species was next to the phosphatidylcholine of E. superba. Therefore, M. rosenbergii appears to be a potential freshwater source for the supplementation of polyunsaturated fatty acids, particularly eicosapentaenoic acid (20:5) and docosahexaenoic acid (22:6). This approach may be used as an efficient method for the identification of natural phosphatidylcholine sources from the broad range of plant, animal, and marine origins.																	0003-2719	1532-236X				JAN 22	2019	52	2					308	319		10.1080/00032719.2018.1459658							WOS:000459887700006

Parameter estimation using randomized phases in an integrated assessment model for Antarctic krill	PLOS ONE												An integrated model assessing the status and productivity of Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba, hereafter krill) was configured to estimate different subsets of 118 potentially estimable parameters in alternative configurations. We fixed the parameters that were not estimated in any given configuration at pre-specified values. The model was fitted to over forty years of fisheries and survey data for krill in Subarea 48.1, a statistical reporting area around the Antarctic Peninsula used by the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR). The number of estimated parameters was gradually increased across model configurations. Configurations that estimated more parameters fitted the data better, but the order in which the parameters were estimated became more important in finding the best fit. Twenty-two configurations estimating from 48 to 107 parameters were able to obtain an invertible Hessian matrix that was subsequently used to estimate parameter uncertainty. Parameter uncertainties calculated using asymptotic approximation around the maximum likelihood estimates were often larger than uncertainties based on Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling for the same parameters. Diagnostics applied to MCMC samples in the best model of each configuration that obtained an invertible Hessian indicated that the most highly parameterized configurations did not reach stationary distributions. A 96-parameter configuration was the best fitting model of those that passed the MCMC diagnostics. The Delta AIC and Delta BIC scores indicated essentially no support relative to the best model for the alternative models that also passed MCMC diagnostics. Simulated data using the configurations as operating models showed that while all configurations passed "self-tests" for spawning biomass and recruitment, there was a small negative bias due to model penalties in the fishing mortality estimates for years with the highest fishing mortalities. "Cross-tests" of configurations that estimated different parameters often differed from the operating model values.																	1932-6203					AUG 17	2018	13	8							e0202545	10.1371/journal.pone.0202545							WOS:000442282700033	30118523

POLAR BIOLOGY												The analysis of 523 scats collected at Harmony Point, Nelson Island, South Shetland Islands, from January to March in 2001 and 2002, indicated that the diet of non-breeding male Antarctic fur seals Arctocephalus gazella was diverse and composed of both pelagic and benthic-demersal prey. Overall, the Antarctic krill Euphausia superba and fish were the most frequent and numerous prey, followed by penguins, cephalopods (mainly squid) and gastropods. Myctophids represented 86.5% and 65.8% of the fish mass in 2001 and 2002 respectively, with Gymnoscopelus nicholsi being the main prey. Interestingly, penguin remains were present in 39.0% and 31.9% of the samples in 2001 and 2002, respectively and these birds were the main prey by reconstituted mass (74.0% and 76.1% in both seasons). The occurrence of penguins in the diet of A. gazella at Harmony Point is discussed in terms of the foraging strategy employed by seals and the temporal availability of prey.																	0722-4060					JAN	2004	27	2					59	65		10.1007/s00300-003-0559-z							WOS:000187918600001

As expected, the North Sea shrimps Crangon crangon and Crangon allmani showed in their midgut glands high proteolytic activities. However, the majority of animals lacked trypsin and chymotrypsin. Conversely, a minority of about 10% of the animals had elevated trypsin activities. The appearance of trypsin was neither related to the mode of feeding nor to the nutritive state of the animals. When present, trypsin was expressed in both species as a single isoform of apparently 20 kDa. The lack of serine proteinases was also confirmed by inhibitor assays. AEBSF, a serine proteinase inhibitor, slightly reduced total proteinase activity by less than 10%. In contrast E 64, a cysteine proteinase inhibitor, caused a reduction of more than 70% of total proteinase activity, indicating that a substantial share of proteolytic activity is caused by cysteine proteinases. Cathepsin L-like proteinases were identified as major cysteine proteinases. A comparison with the eucarid crustaceans Pandalus montagui, Pagurus bernhardus, Cancer pagurus and Euphausia superba showed a similar high level of total proteinase activity in all species. Trypsin, however, varied significantly between species showing lowest activities in Caridea and the highest activity in E. superba. E 64 suppressed total proteinase activity by more than 70% in Crangon species but not in C. pagurus and E. superba. In contrast, the serine proteinase inhibitor AEBSF had only little effect in Caridea but was most effective in P. bernhardus, C. pagurus and E. superba. The results may indicate different traits of food utilization strategies in some eucarid crustaceans. Caridea may express predominantly cysteine proteinase, while in Anomura, Brachyura and Euphausiacea, serine proteinases may prevail. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Brierley, AS; Ward, P; Watkins, JL; Goss, C				Brierley, AS; Ward, P; Watkins, JL; Goss, C			Acoustic discrimination of Southern Ocean zooplankton	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY												Acoustic surveys in the vicinity of the sub-Antarctic island of South Georgia during a period of exceptionally calm weather revealed the existence of a number of horizontally extensive yet vertically discrete scattering layers in the upper 250 m of the water column. These layers were fished with a Longhurst-Hardy plankton recorder (LHPR) and a multiple-opening 8 m(2) rectangular mid-water trawl (RMT8). Analysis of catches suggested that each scattering layer was composed predominantly of a single species (biovolume > 95%) of either the euphausiids Euphausia frigida or Thysanoessa macrura, the hyperiid amphipod Themisto gaudichaudii, or the eucalaniid copepod Rhincalanus gigas. Instrumentation on the nets allowed their trajectories to be reconstructed precisely, and thus catch data to be related directly to the corresponding acoustic signals. Discriminant function analysis of differences between mean volume backscattering strength at 38, 120 and 200 kHz separated echoes originating from each of the dominant scattering layers, and other signals identified as originating from Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba), with an overall correct classification rate of 77%. Using echo intensity data alone, gathered using hardware commonly employed for fishery acoustics, it is therefore possible to discriminate in situ between several zooplanktonic taxa, taxa which in some instances exhibit similar gross morphological characteristics and have overlapping length-frequency distributions. Acoustic signals from the mysid Antarctomysis maxima could also be discriminated once information on target distribution was considered, highlighting the value of incorporating multiple descriptors of echo characteristics into signal identification procedures. The ability to discriminate acoustically between zooplankton taxa could be applied to provide improved acoustic estimates of species abundance, and to enhance field studies of zooplankton ecology, distribution and species interactions.

The potential role of Antarctic krill faecal pellets in efficient carbon export at the marginal ice zone of the South Orkney Islands in spring	POLAR BIOLOGY												Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) play a central role in the food web of the Southern Ocean, forming a link between primary production and large predators. Krill produce large, faecal pellets (FP) which can form a large component of mesopelagic particulate organic carbon (POC) fluxes. However, the patchy distribution of krill swarms, highly variable pellet composition, and variable sinking and attenuation rates means that these episodic, but potentially large, carbon fluxes are difficult to sample or model. We measured particle flux and type using Marine Snow Catchers (MSC) in the marginal ice zone near the South Orkneys, Antarctica. Krill FP were the dominant component of the POC flux in the upper 200 m (typically 60-85%). FP sinking velocities measured onboard were highly variable (15-507 m d(-1)) but overall high, with mean equivalent velocities of 172, 267, and 161 m d(-1) at our three stations. The high numbers of krill FP sinking through the mesopelagic suggest that krill FP can be transferred efficiently and/or that rates of krill FP production are high. We compared our direct MSC-derived estimates of krill FP POC flux (33-154 mg C m(-2) d(-1)) and attenuation to estimates of krill FP production based on previous measurements of krill density and literature FP egestion rates, and estimated net krill FP attenuation rates in the upper mesopelagic. Calculated attenuation rates are sensitive to krill densities in the overlying water column but suggest that krill FP could be transferred efficiently through the upper mesopelagic, and, in agreement with our MSC attenuation estimates, could make large contributions to bathypelagic POC fluxes. Our study contrasts with some others which suggest rapid FP attenuation, highlighting the need for further work to constrain attenuation rates and assess how important the contribution of Antarctic krill FP could be to the Southern Ocean biological carbon pump.

Micro- and mesozooplankton successions in an Antarctic coastal environment during a warm year	PLOS ONE												The rapid increase in atmospheric temperature detected in the last decades in the Western Antarctic Peninsula was accompanied by a strong glacier retreat and an increase in production of melting water, as well as changes in the sea-ice dynamic. The objective of this study was to analyze the succession of micro- and mesozooplankton during a warm annual cycle (December 2010-December 2011) in an Antarctic coastal environment (Potter Cove). The biomass of zooplankton body size classes was used to predict predator-prey size relationships (i.e., to test bottom-up/top-down control effects) using a Multiple Linear Regression Analysis. The micro- and mesozooplanktonic successions were graphically analyzed to detect the influence of environmental periods (defined by the degree of glacial melting, seaice freezing and sea-ice melting) on coupling/uncoupling planktonic biomass curves associated to possible predator-prey size relationship scenarios. At the beginning of the glacial melting, medium and large mesozooplankton (calanoid copepods, Euphausia superba, and Salpa thompsoni) exert a top-down control on Chl-a and microzooplankton. Stratification of the water column benefitted the availability of adequate food-size (Chl-a <20) for large microzooplankton (tintinnids) development observed during fall. High abundance of omnivores mesozooplankton (Oithona similis and furcilia of E. superba) during sea-ice freezing periods would be due to the presence of available heterotrophic food under or within the sea ice. Finally, the increase in microzooplankton abundance in the middle of spring, when seaice melting starts, corresponded to small and medium dinoflagellates and ciliates species, which were possibly part of the biota of sea ice. If glacier retreat continues and the duration and thickness of the sea ice layer fluctuates as predicted by climate models, our results predict a future scenario regarding the zooplankton succession in Antarctic coastal environments.

The collection of diet samples on three occasions over a 2-week period was compared with collecting all samples during a single session, as current CCAMLR Ecosystem Monitoring Programme protocols recommend. Some differences in the mass of food recovered from penguins were found but this was attributed to the mass of penguin sampled. There were no differences in diet composition between protocols and although body mass was a significant determinant of the mean length of krill Euphausia superba recovered from penguins, there were no differences between sampling protocols. This study has shown that; differences between sampling frequencies are small and a variety of sampling protocols can produce results acceptable for inter-annual monitoring. The mass of sampled individuals can account for significant variation and should be recorded, especially if sampling frequencies and sizes are low.																	0722-4060					SEP	1999	22	3					156	163		10.1007/s003000050405							WOS:000082423000002

The vertical distribution and developmental stage composition of Rhincalanus gigas, Calanoides acutus, Calanus propinquus and krill, Euphausia superba larvae, were a good index for a general assessment of the seasonal condition of the plankton communities. There were five zones differing in seasonal situation: (1) The Polar Front and the southern ACC (not studied in detail), (2) The Weddell Front, (3) The Weddell Gyre interior, (4) The Maud Rise area, and (5) The Coastal Current zone. In the Weddell Front, the planktonic community resembled an autumnal situation with moderate phytoplankton biomass; the overwintering stock of copepods was not completely formed and the occurrence of calyptopes larvae of E. superba indicated that krill continued to reproduce until May. In the Weddell Gyre interior, a typical winter plankton community was found even before sea ice had formed. The specific hydrographic regime of the Maud Rise (governed by the mesoscale circulation over the seamount) support the late autumn conditions similar to the Weddell Front (but without early krill larvae). The plankton of the Coastal Current was a winter community. We conclude that in the eastern part of the Weddell Front (compared to the western part) seasonal development of both phytoplankton and herbivorous zooplankton is delayed in spring but prolonged in late autumn. Furthermore, it appears that the Weddell Sea ecosystem exhibits a much higher degree of spatial and temporal variability than thought before. This may have an impact on seasonal pattern of organic carbon transport from the pelagic realm to deeper water layers and to the sediment.

J	Rombola, E; Marschoff, E; Coria, N				Rombola, Emilce; Marschoff, Enrique; Coria, Nestor			Interannual study of chinstrap penguin's diet and reproductive success at Laurie Island, South Orkney Islands, Antarctica	POLAR BIOLOGY												Inter-annual variability in the diet of Chin-strap penguins (Pygoscelis antarctica) at Laurie Island, South Orkney Islands was examined based on stomach contents of adults coming ashore during the 1997/1998-2001/2002 breeding seasons. Krill (Euphausia superba) dominated the diet either as frequency of occurrence (in 100% of samples), number (> 99%), and percentage contribution in weight (> 99.5%). Other prey items were minor but did vary between years. The contribution in weight of fish, amphipods and cephalopods ranged between 0.01-0.5, < 0.01-0.14 and 0-0.03, respectively. Although minor components varied slightly along the years, the weight of stomach contents was significantly different. It was found that for a given weight the maximum observed percentage of undigested krill resulted negatively correlated with the stomach contents total weight. The proportion of whole krill observed in individual penguins, expressed as a fraction of the maximum corresponding to its weight was used to characterize the prevailing conditions in each season.																	0722-4060	1432-2056				MAY	2006	29	6					502	509		10.1007/s00300-005-0081-6							WOS:000238425400007

In invertebrates, AK is the major phosphagen kinase that modulates the energy metabolism. Here, the full-length cDNA sequence encoding arginine kinase (EcAK) was obtained from the Exopalaemon carinicauda. The complete nucleotide sequence of EcAK contained a 1068 bp open reading frame (ORF) encoding EcAK precursor of 355 amino acids. The genomic DNA fragment of EcAK with the corresponding cDNA sequence is composed of 4 exons and 3 introns. The domain architecture of the deduced EcAK protein contained an ATP-gua_PtransN domain and an ATP-gua_Ptrans domain. EcAK mRNA was predominantly expressed in the muscle. The expression of EcAK in the prawns challenged with Vibrio parahaemolyticus and Aeromonas hydrophila changed in a time-dependent manner. Then, EcAK was recombinantly expressed in Pichia pastoris and the purified recombinant EcAK had the same enzymatic characterization as AK from the muscle of Euphausia superba. In conclusion, EcAK may play the same biological activity in E. carinicauda as those from other crustaceans.																	1050-4648	1095-9947				FEB	2021	109						82	86		10.1016/j.fsi.2020.12.009							WOS:000612087300002	33352337

Predicting krill swarm characteristics important for marine predators foraging off East Antarctica	ECOGRAPHY												Open ocean predator-prey interactions are often difficult to interpret because of a lack of information on prey fields at scales relevant to predator behaviour. Hence, there is strong interest in identifying the biological and physical factors influencing the distribution and abundance of prey species, which may be of broad predictive use for conservation planning and evaluating effects of environmental change. This study focuses on a key Southern Ocean prey species, Antarctic krill Euphausia superba, using acoustic observations of individual swarms (aggregations) from a large-scale survey off East Antarctica. We developed two sets of statistical models describing swarm characteristics, one set using underway survey data for the explanatory variables, and the other using their satellite remotely sensed analogues. While survey data are in situ and contemporaneous with the swarm data, remotely sensed data are all that is available for prediction and inference about prey distribution in other areas or at other times. The fitted models showed that the primary biophysical influences on krill swarm characteristics included daylight (solar elevation/radiation) and proximity to the Antarctic continental slope, but there were also complex relationships with current velocities and gradients. Overall model performance was similar regardless of whether underway or remotely sensed predictors were used. We applied the latter models to generate regional-scale spatial predictions using a 10-yr remotely-sensed time series. This retrospective modelling identified areas off east Antarctica where relatively dense krill swarms were consistently predicted during austral mid-summers, which may underpin key foraging areas for marine predators. Spatiotemporal predictions along Antarctic predator satellite tracks, from independent studies, illustrate the potential for uptake into further quantitative modelling of predator movements and foraging. The approach is widely applicable to other krill-dependent ecosystems, and our findings are relevant to similar efforts examining biophysical linkages elsewhere in the Southern Ocean and beyond.

Phospholipid characteristics and neutral lipid fatty acid composition related to temperature and nutritional conditions in ecologically important amphipod species from the northern Baltic Sea	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY												Lipid composition of the benthic, stenothermal amphipod Monoporeia affinis collected from constantly cold deep-water (>80 m) regions of the northern Baltic Sea was analysed in detail to study phospholipid characteristics, its relation to thermal adaptation as well as potential effects of food quality and seasonal variability. Similar measurements were performed on the littoral, eurythermic amphipod Gammarus spp. Fatty acid (FA) composition of storage lipids of Pontoporeia femorata, a sibling species of M. affinis, was also studied. Interannual and interspecies variability in selected FA was observed both in triacylglycerols (TAG) and phospholipids (PL). Differences in monounsaturated vs. polyunsaturated (MUFA/PUFA) FA combinations of phosphatidyl ethanolamine (PE) diacyl and alkylacyl subgroups were also observed. Seasonal variability in M. affinis was considerably lesser compared to Gammarus spp. A literature synopsis shows that in diacyl PE the share of the FA combination MUFA/PUFA increases with lowering body temperature (40-55% in cold-adapted organisms vs. 5-15% in warm adapted ones), signifying that this characteristic is probably in key position concerning regulation of membrane fluidity in temperature adaptation. According to this feature M. affinis belongs to the group of cold-adapted stenothermic species (Group 1) while eurythermic Gammarus spp. settles in the Group 2 (cold-acclimatized) or 3 (warm-acclimatized/tropical) depending on the status of temperature adaptation. Omnivory and/or periodical food item switching is an important strategy in benthic organisms in high-latitude areas characterised by recurring long poor-nutritional periods. Since many benthic species utilise a time-averaged, integrated food source from phytal and animal matter from various sources the FA composition of TAG of the amphipod species measured here do not exclusively point towards any specific feeding mode or food source. In general, using selected FA as food source markers to assess the diet of field collected more-or-less omnivoric species cannot be considered as an optimal approach. The current study gives more insight to the biochemistry of biological membranes of aquatic crustaceans that is essential in estimation of the capacity of the thermal adaptation/acclimatization of organisms as well as the potential effects of food quality on storage lipids.

Here, we present a framework for assessing the status and trends of key ocean habitat components using synoptic data sources. It aims to quantify ecosystem variability and long-term change, and to provide summaries and indicators of change at scales that are both ecologically meaningful and relevant for management. We illustrate our approach using the Southern Ocean as a case-study and assess habitat based on remotely-sensed sea ice concentration, sea surface temperature (SST) and chlorophyll-a. We use Antarctic krill Euphausia superba as an illustrative example of how thresholds and optimum ranges for key taxa (and the ranges they define) can be used to delimit areas that are likely to constitute "good" habitat. Availability of "good" habitat, in terms of area, provides a simple indicator for quantifying change through time, and for assessing regional differences. Our assessment of sea ice reveals that the absence of a strong trend in the mean annual duration of sea ice cover around Antarctica masks a loss of areas with the longest periods of cover. In the polar latitudinal zone of the East Pacific, the area with the longest ice coverage has declined by 123,533 km(2) over the past four decades. Our assessment of chlorophyll-a and SST highlights that the area of "good" habitat for krill has increased in the high-latitude zone, but decreased in the polar zone close to the continent in all sectors other than the East Pacific, where the reverse has been true. These examples demonstrate how our general approach can visualise and identify (i) known trends in mean values but also diagnose where changes in the habitat area over time may not match the mean trend; (ii) key habitat thresholds across a range of variables and in different seasons; and (iii) changes in the degree of spatial overlap of areas with desirable ranges for different habitat components. Our approach provides a versatile method to generate summaries of status and trends of ocean habitats at scales meaningful to decision makers. It can readily be adapted to other habitat variables and for other areas, supporting ongoing efforts to assess status and trends of open ocean habitats worldwide.

Feeding ecology and metabolism of the Antarctic cydippid ctenophore Callianira antarctica	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												The chemical composition, metabolism, and feeding ecology of the cydippid ctenophore Callianira antarctica (Chun 1897) were investigated during autumn and winter 2001 and 2002 in the vicinity of Marguerite Bay, an embayment on the western Antarctic Peninsula shelf. C. an tarctica had relatively high carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) values (average: 8.4% C and 1.8% N [% dry weight, DW]), further suggesting that polar ctenophores are more C-rich than tropical species. Winter oxygen consumption and ammonium excretion rates ranged from 0.059 to 0.411 mu l O-2 mg(-1) DW h(-1) and 0.043 to 2.22 nmol N mg(-1) DW h(-1), respectively, at 0 degrees C. Calanoid copepods, larval and juvenile Antarctic krill Euphausia superba and a mixture of prey were offered to ctenophores during feeding incubations. Ingestion rates based on preliminary feeding experiments were linearly related to prey densities, with rates ranging from 9 to 39 prey ind.(-1) d(-1) and from 3.5 to 4.0 prey ind.(-1) d(-1) for 1 larger and I smaller C. antarctica, respectively. Daily rations varied between 22 and 136% of body C for the larger ctenophore and 6 to 22 % of body C for the smaller individual. Digestion time (median: 11.5 h) was dependent on prey elemental content and prey number, and was independent of ctenophore size. Gut content analyses indicated that C. antarctica preyed predominantly on larval euphausiids and copepods. Diver observations, net collections, and diet analyses suggest that this species is an opportunistic predator that feeds both during the day and night, and appears to be well adapted to the prey patchiness found in Antarctic waters.																	0171-8630						2006	317						111	126		10.3354/meps317111							WOS:000239896600011

We examined the delta(15)N and delta(13)C values of Antarctic euphausiids and copepods from the Polar Front, Lazarev Sea, and Marguerite Bay against their foodweb baseline of particulate organic matter (POM). Interpretations of trophic level were helped by comparison with other approaches and by calibration experiments with Euphausia superba fed known diets: Results for well-known mesozooplankters (e.g., Calanoides acutus and Metridia gerlachei) were internally consistent and corresponded to those derived from independent methods. This gave confidence in the isotope approach for copepods and probably larval euphausiids. Among the dominant yet poorly known species, it suggested mainly herbivory for Rhincalanus gigas but omnivory for Calanus simillimus and furcilia larvae of Thysanoessa spp. and Euphausia frigida. The delta(15)N values of adult copepods were up to 3parts per thousand higher than those of early copepodites, pointing to ontogenetic shifts in diet. In the Lazarev Sea in autumn, the isotopic signals of E. superba larvae suggested pelagic, mainly herbivorous, feeding rather than feeding within the ice. In contrast to the mesozooplankton, some anomalous results for postlarval krill species indicated problems with this method for micronekton. The experiments showed that postlarval E. superba did not equilibriate with a new diet within 30 d. We suggest that the slower turnover of these larger species, partly in combination with their ability to migrate, has confounded trophic effects with those of a temporally/spatially changing food-web baseline. Interpretations of food sources of micronekton could be helped by analyzing their molts or fecal pellets, which responded faster to a new diet.

Aspects of the foraging behaviour of the Antarctic Tern Sterna vittata gaini at Harmony Point, South Shetland Islands	POLAR BIOLOGY												During January and February of 2002 and 2003, we studied the diet of the Antarctic Tern Sterna vittata gaini at two colonies in Nelson Island, South Shetland Islands, by identifying the prey fed to chicks by breeders. The fish Notothenia coriiceps was the main prey in both seasons, followed by the myctophid Electrona antarctica, Antarctic krill Euphausia superba and gammarid amphipods. The contribution of fish to the diet increased as chicks grew older. Fish and amphipods were brought to chicks during the day, whereas adults brought Antarctic krill at sunrise and sunset. Both the duration of the feeding trips and the number of trips per foraging bout varied according to the type of prey caught. Preliminary information suggests that, among other causes, the foraging strategy is strongly influenced by the predation pressure of skuas on chicks. Results are compared with the only two previous study on the diet of the Antarctic Tern at the South Shetland Islands.																	0722-4060	1432-2056				FEB	2008	31	3					327	331		10.1007/s00300-007-0362-3							WOS:000252193100009

Therefore, we review some examples of exploited fishery stocks in which environmental control is a major contributor to structuring the abundance and distribution of the stock. Four examples, taken from studies of northern cod (Gadus morhua), cod and haddock (Melanogrammus aeglefinus) larvae, the eastern oyster (Crassostrea virginica), and Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba), are given that clearly illustrate environmental control on the fishery. From these examples, we argue that future management strategies for exploited fisheries must include effects of environmental variability. In particular, management strategies must be flexible enough to include delayed responses to environmental variations that result from the transfer of perturbations from larger to smaller scales and vice versa. This capability requires an understanding of where linkages between the physical environment and the species of interest occur. Development of this knowledge requires input from a variety of disciplines, coordinated research programs, and considerable cooperation at national and international levels.																	1051-0761					FEB	1998	8	1		S			S23	S32		10.1890/1051-0761(1998)8[S23:EVEOMF]2.0.CO;2							WOS:000072166600004

The German research icebreaker Polarstern operated in heavy pack ice along the Greenwich Meridian between the northern sea ice boundary and the Antartic coast. Crabeater seals (Lobodon carcinophagus), minke whales (Balaenoptera acutorostrata), Adelie penguins (Pygoscelis adeliae), Antarctic petrels (Thalassoica antarctica) and snow petrels (Pagodroma nivea) were found to be more abundant in the vicinity of the submarine Maud Rise, about 700 km north of the continental margin, than in other areas of substantial ice cover traversed during that cruise. The aggregations of birds and mammals are expected to reflect aggregations of their principal food, krill (Euphausia superba) wintering underneath the ice cover. The distribution pattern of krill predators coincides with the course of a warm water belt upwelling near Maud Rise. This upwelling could induce local ice melting which in turn may result in an increased release of sea ice algae.																	0722-4060	1432-2056				SEP	1991	11	5					305	309									WOS:A1991GG91200003

The excretion of protease was maximal at temperatures from 5 to 10 degrees C, i.e. below the temperature optimum for the strain growth (15 degrees C). The highly purified enzyme was a metalloprotease [sensitivity to ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA)] and showed maximal activity against proteins at 20-30 degrees C and pH 6.5-7.0, and towards N-benzoyl-tyrosine ethyl ester (BzTyrOEt) at pH 8.0. At 0 degrees C the enzyme retained as much as 47% of maximal activity in hydrolysis of urea denatured haemoglobin (Hb) (at pH 7.0), and at -5 and -10 degrees C, 37 and 30%, respectively. The metalloprotease was stable up to 30 degrees C for 15 min and up to 20 degrees C for 60 min. These results indicate that the proteinase from S. paucimobilis 116 is a cold-adapted enzyme.

Overwinter habitat selection by Antarctic krill under varying sea-ice conditions: implications for top predators and fishery management	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												Climate change will affect Antarctic krill Euphausia superba, krill-dependent predators, and fisheries in the Southern Ocean as areas typically covered by sea ice become ice-free in some winters. Research cruises conducted around the South Shetland Islands of the Antarctic Peninsula during winters with contrasting ice conditions provide the first acoustic estimates of krill biomass, habitat use, and association with top predators to examine potential interactions with the krill fishery. Krill abundance was very low in offshore waters during all winters. In Bransfield Strait, median krill abundance was an order of magnitude higher (8 krill m(-2)) compared to summer (0.25 krill m(-2)), and this pattern was ob served in all winters regardless of ice cover. Acoustic estimates of krill biomass were also an order of magnitude higher (similar to 5 500 000 metric tons [t] in 2014) than a 15 yr summer average (520 000 t). Looking at krill-dependent predators, during winter, crabeater seals Lobodon carcinophagus were concentrated in Brans-field Strait where ice provided habitat, while Antarctic fur seals Arctocephalus gazella were more broadly distributed. Krill overwinter in coastal basin environments independent of ice and primary production and in an area that is becoming more frequently ice-free. While long-term projections of climate change have focused on changing krill habitat and productivity declines, more immediate impacts of ongoing climate change include increased risks of negative fishery-krill-predator interactions, alteration of upper trophic level community structure, and changes in the pelagic ecology of this system. Development of management strategies to mitigate the increased risk to krill populations and their dependent predators over management timescales will be necessary to minimize the impacts of long-term climate change.

In the Southern Ocean, there is an extensive fishery for Antarctic krill Euphausia superba that is projected to increase further. Comparing distribution and prey selection of fishing operations versus predators is needed to predict fishery-related impacts on krill-dependent predators. In this context, it is important to consider not only predators breeding near the fishing grounds but also the ones breeding far away and that disperse during the non-breeding season where they may interact with fisheries. In this study, we first quantified the overlap between the distribution of the Antarctic krill fisheries and the distribution of a krill dependent seabird, the Antarctic petrel Thalassoica antarctica, during both the breeding and non-breeding season. We tracked birds from the world biggest Antarctic petrel colony (Svarthamaren, Dronning Maud Land), located >1000 km from the main fishing areas, during three consecutive seasons. The overall spatial overlap between krill fisheries and Antarctic petrels was limited but varied greatly among and within years, and was high in some periods during the non-breeding season. In a second step, we described the length frequency distribution of Antarctic krill consumed by Antarctic petrels, and compared this with results from fisheries, as well as from diet studies in other krill predators. Krill taken by Antarctic petrels did not differ in size from that taken by trawls or from krill taken by most Antarctic krill predators. Selectivity for specific Antarctic krill stages seems generally low in Antarctic predators. Overall, our results show that competition between Antarctic petrels and krill fisheries is currently likely negligible. However, if krill fisheries are to increase in the future, competition with the Antarctic petrel may occur, even with birds breeding thousands of kilometers away.

Diet variability and reproductive performance of macaroni penguins Eudyptes chrysolophus at Bird Island, South Georgia	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												We analysed summer diet and fledging mass of macaroni penguins Eudyptes chrysolophus breeding at Bird Island, South Georgia, during the creche period (January and February) between 1989 and 2010. Crustaceans were the main prey accounting, for over 90% of the diet by mass. Antarctic krill Euphausia superba was the main prey, in 17 out of 22 years. Amphipods Themisto gaudichaudii were the main prey in 1994 and 2009, fish in 2004, and the euphausiids Thysanoessa spp. and Euphausia frigida in 2000. There was no clearly dominant prey group in 1999. Prey diversity and the frequency occurrence of T. gaudichaudii both increased with a decreasing proportion of E. superba in the diet. There was strong evidence that macaroni penguins have a sigmoidal functional response, indicating that this kind of response should be accounted for when devising ecosystem-based management reference points for seabirds. The energy and mass of all euphausiids combined (rather than E. superba in particular) in the diet were the most reliable predictors of chick fledging mass; the correlation between model-predicted and observed values was 0.84. The gross energy content of individual meals was often above average in years when the diets contained fewer euphausiids, but fledging mass was always below average in these years. Although macaroni penguins are able to feed on a variety of prey types, chick growth was always severely impacted by a shortage of euphausiids due to higher energy or time costs associated with feeding on alternative prey types. Given their reliance on euphausiids, macaroni penguins would be particularly vulnerable to potential climate-driven declines in krill stocks.

Modelling three-dimensional directivity of sound scattering by Antarctic krill: progress towards biomass estimation using multibeam sonar	ICES JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE					ICES Symposium on the Ecosystem Approach to Fisheries Acoutics and Complementary Technologies	JUN 16-20, 2008	Bergen, NORWAY	ICES				Target strength (TS) estimation is a principal source of uncertainty in acoustic surveys of Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba). Although TS is strongly dependent on krill orientation, there is a paucity of information in this regard. This paper considers the potential for narrow-bandwidth, multibeam-echosounder (MBE) data to be used for estimating the orientations of krill beneath survey vessels. First, software was developed to predict MBE measurements of the directivity patterns of acoustic scattering from individual or aggregated krill in any orientation. Based on the distorted-wave, Born approximation model (DWBA), scattering intensities are predicted vs. MBE angles for specified distributions of krill orientations (pitch, roll, and yaw angles) and swarm densities. Results indicate that certain distributions of orientations, perhaps indicative of particular behaviour, should be apparent from the sonar data. The model results are compared with measurements on krill made using a 200-kHz MBE deployed from a small craft off Cape Shirreff, Livingston Island, Antarctica, in summer 2006. The stochastic DWBA model is then invoked to explain disparities between the model predictions and MBE measurements.

Distribution, growth, diet and foraging behaviour of the yellow-fin notothen Patagonotothen guntheri (Norman) on the Shag Rocks shelf (Southern Ocean)	JOURNAL OF FISH BIOLOGY												The distribution, total length (L-T) frequency and diet of Patagonotothen guntheri are described from 14 bottom trawl surveys conducted on the Shag Rocks and South Georgia shelves in the austral summers from 1986 to 2006. Patagonotothen guntheri (80-265 mm L-T) were caught on the Shag Rocks shelf from depths of 111 to 470 m, but no specimens were caught on the South Georgia shelf. Multiple cohorts were present during each survey and L-T-frequency analysis of these cohorts suggests that growth was slow (von Bertalanffy K = 0.133). Evidence from stomach contents and acoustic data (2005 and 2006) showed that P. guntheri is primarily a pelagic feeder, migrating from the sea floor towards the surface to feed during daylight. The diet of smaller fish (< 140 mm) was dominated by copepods, predominantly Rhincalanus gigas, whilst larger fish principally consumed the pelagic hyperiid amphipod, Themisto gaudichaudii and Antarctic krill Euphausia superba. Some larger fish also took benthic prey. (C) 2008 The Authors Journal compilation (C) 2008 The Fisheries Society of the British Isles.

In one objective technique for identifying Antarctic krill, the difference between mean volume-backscattering strength at two frequencies is used, but can misclassify small krill and other plankton. Here, we investigate ways to improve target identification by including characteristics of backscattering energy and morphology of aggregations. To do this, multi-frequency acoustic data were collected concurrently with target fishing of Antarctic krill and other euphausiid and salp aggregations. Parameter sets for these known aggregations were collated and used to develop empirical classifications. Both linear discriminant-function analysis (DFA) and the artificial neural network technique were employed. In both cases, acoustic-backscattering energy parameters were most important for discriminating between Antarctic krill and other zooplankton. However, swarm morphology and other parameters improved the discrimination, particularly between krill and salps. Our study suggests that for krill-biomass estimates, a simple DFA based on acoustic-energy parameters is a substantial improvement over current dB-difference acoustic methods; but studies requiring the discrimination of zooplankton other than krill must still be supported by target fishing.

To investigate the physiological and biochemical adaptations that may enable seabirds to break down this ''prey defense,'' we estimated chitin digestibilities for Sooty Albatrosses (Phoebetria fusca), White-chinned Petrels (Procellaria aequinoctialis), Rockhopper Penguins (Eudyptes chrysocome), Gentoo Penguins (Pygoscelis papua), King Penguins (Aptenodytes patagonicus) and Leach's Storm-Petrels (Oceanodroma leucorhoa) fed Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba). These species retain a substantial proportion (46.5 +/- SD of 13.1%, 39.1 +/- 4.9%, 52.8 +/- 37.6%, 45.3 +/- 5.6%, 84.8 +/- 11.7% and 35 +/- 12.2%, respectively) of ingested chitin. We also obtained preliminary estimates of chitinolytic activity in the gastric mucosae of the above six species by incubating extracts of tissue samples with a chitin substrate and measuring the production of the end product of chitin hydrolysis, N-acetyl-D-glucosamine (NAG). Chitinolytic activity (up to 5,000 mug NAG h-1 g-1 expressed per gram tissue) was measured from proventricular tissue and within the activity range (1,350 to 61,650,ug NAG h-1 g-1) reported for eight other avian species. In order to assess the energetic and nutritional benefits of chitinolytic activity in seabirds, we studied gastrointestinal absorption of the end products of chitinolysis in Leach's Storm-Petrels. The overall absorption efficiency of NAG and its deacetylated precursor, glucosamine (Gln), in this species was 44.0 +/- 3.0% and 11.0 +/- 1.9%, respectively. These absorption efficiencies were significantly less than for glucose, which was absorbed with an efficiency of 90.6 +/- 2.5%. No absorption of NAG and Gln occurred in the proventriculus. Overall, we showed that seabirds have a capacity to assimilate a considerable portion of the carbon and nitrogen present as chitin in the exoskeleton of their prey, but we have not demonstrated that assimilation actually occurs. The potential costs and benefits of chitin hydrolysis, as well as the absorption of the breakdown products, need to be assessed.

Histological results showed that AKO promoted longitudinal bone growth, increased skeletal mineral content and strength, enhanced entochondrostosis supported by higher longitudinal bone growth rate and growth plate height. Then, the potential mechanisms responsible for these observations were measured, results showed that AKO increased the secretion of the GH-IGF-1 pathway and entochondrostosis-related factors in serum increased the expression of IGF-1 in the liver and bone, which promoted proliferation and differentiation of chondrocytes, vascular invasion and bone formation related gene expression. AKO promoted longitudinal bone growth, using the GH-IGF-1 pathway, suggesting that AKO might be a potential functional food to improve growth potential of adolescents.																	2212-4292	2212-4306				APR	2019	28						170	176		10.1016/j.fbio.2019.02.002							WOS:000460408800023

Not only is it a significant grazer of phytoplankton, but it is also a major food item for charismatic megafauna such as whales and seals and an important Southern Ocean fisheries crop. Ecological data suggest that this species is being affected by climate change and this will have considerable consequences for the balance of the Southern Ocean ecosystem. Hence, understanding how this organism functions is a priority area and will provide fundamental data for life history studies, energy budget calculations and food web models. Methodology/Principal Findings: The assembly of the 454 transcriptome of E. superba resulted in 22,177 contigs with an average size of 492bp (ranging between 137 and 8515bp). In depth analysis of the data revealed an extensive catalogue of the cellular chaperone systems and the major antioxidant proteins. Full length sequences were characterised for the chaperones HSP70, HSP90 and the super-oxide dismutase antioxidants, with the discovery of potentially novel duplications of these genes. The sequence data contained 41,470 microsatellites and 17,776 Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs/INDELS), providing a resource for population and also gene function studies. Conclusions: This paper details the first 454 generated data for a pelagic Antarctic species or any pelagic crustacean globally. The classical "stress proteins'', such as HSP70, HSP90, ferritin and GST were all highly expressed. These genes were shown to be over expressed in the transcriptomes of Antarctic notothenioid fish and hypothesized as adaptations to living in the cold, with the associated problems of decreased protein folding efficiency and increased vulnerability to damage by reactive oxygen species. Hence, these data will provide a major resource for future physiological work on krill, but in particular a suite of "stress'' genes for studies understanding marine ectotherms' capacities to cope with environmental change.

J	Fraser, WR; Hofmann, EE				Fraser, WR; Hofmann, EE			A predator's perspective on causal links between climate change, physical forcing and ecosystem response	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												The mechanisms by which variability in sea ice cover and its effects on the demography of the Antarctic krill Euphausia superba cascade to other ecosystem components such as apex predators remain poorly understood at all spatial and temporal scales, yet these interactions are essential for understanding causal links between climate change, ecosystem response and resource monitoring and management in the Southern Ocean. To address some of these issues, we examined the long-term foraging responses of Adelie penguins Pygoscelis adeliae near Palmer Station, western Antarctic Peninsula, in relation to ice-induced changes in krill recruitment and availability. Our results suggest that (1) there is a direct, causal relationship between variability in ice cover, krill recruitment, prey availability and predator foraging ecology, (2) regional patterns and trends detected in this study are consistent with similar observations in areas as far north as South Georgia, and (3) large-scale forcing associated with the Antarctic Circumpolar Wave may be governing ecological interactions between ice, krill and their predators in the western Antarctic Peninsula and Scotia Sea regions. Another implication of our analyses is that during the last 2 decades in particular, krill populations have been sustained by strong age classes that emerge episodically every 4 to 5 yr. This raises the possibility that cohort senescence has become an additional ecosystem stressor in an environment where ice conditions conducive to good krill recruitment are deteriorating due to climate warming. In exploring these interactions, our results suggest that at least 1 'senescence event' has already occurred in the western Antarctic Peninsula region, and it accounts for significant coherent decreases in krill abundance, predator populations and predator foraging and breeding performance. We propose that krill longevity should be incorporated into models that seek to identify and understand causal links between climate change, physical forcing and ecosystem response in the western Antarctic Peninsula region.																	0171-8630	1616-1599					2003	265						1	15		10.3354/meps265001							WOS:000188774900001

Squid in the diet of Antarctic fur seals: potential links to oceanographic conditions and Antarctic krill abundance	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												Understanding how changes in oceanographic conditions affect predators and their prey is fundamental for interpreting variability in natural marine ecosystems. At South Georgia, Antarctic fur seals Arctocephalus gazella are known cephalopod predators and potential indicators of changes in regional environment conditions and prey availability. The cephalopod component of the diet of Antarctic fur seals at South Georgia was assessed using lower beaks found in scats collected over 5 consecutive years (2009-2013) under known variable oceanographic conditions. In years of unusually warm oceanographic conditions around South Georgia and low Antarctic krill Euphausia superba density, the number of squids Slosarczykovia circumantarctica increased in the seals' diet. Moreover, stable isotope analysis of beaks showed that S. circumantarctica exhibited higher delta N-15 values in years that were associated with an offshore habitat (lower delta C-13 values) where Antarctic fur seals had been foraging. This study provides evidence of the ecological links between the feeding behaviour of Antarctic fur seals, their main cephalopod prey, Antarctic krill densities and oceanographic conditions.

Productivity and linkages of the food web of the southern region of the western Antarctic Peninsula continental shelf	PROGRESS IN OCEANOGRAPHY												The productivity and linkages in the food web of the southern region of the west Antarctic Peninsula continental shelf were investigated using a multi-trophic level mass balance model. Data collected during the Southern Ocean Global Ocean Ecosystem Dynamics field program were combined with data from the literature on the abundance and diet composition of zooplankton, fish, seabirds and marine mammals to calculate energy flows in the food web and to infer the overall food web structure at the annual level. Sensitivity analyses investigated the effects of variability in growth and biomass of Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) and in the biomass of Antarctic krill predators on the structure and energy fluxes in the food web. Scenario simulations provided insights into the potential responses of the food web to a reduced contribution of large phytoplankton (diatom) production to total primary production, and to reduced consumption of primary production by Antarctic krill and mesozooplankton coincident with increased consumption by microzooplankton and salps. Model-derived estimates of primary production were 187-207 g C m(-2) y(-1), which are consistent with observed values (47-351 g C m(-2) y(-1)). Simulations showed that Antarctic krill provide the majority of energy needed to sustain seabird and marine mammal production, thereby exerting a bottom-up control on higher trophic level predators. Energy transfer to top predators via mesozooplanton was a less efficient pathway, and salps were a production loss pathway because little of the primary production they consumed was passed to higher trophic levels. Increased predominance of small phytoplankton (nanoflagellates and cryptophytes) reduced the production of Antarctic krill and of its predators, including seabirds and seals. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The model describes the energetic requirements of the chick. with growth resulting from the difference between assimilated energy and respiration. Parameterizations of these metabolic processes are based upon experimental and field observations. Ingestion of Antarctic krill by the chick is dependent on the frequency of food delivery to the chick by the adults, which is based on measured foraging times. The mass, size, and size frequency distribution of Antarctic krill fed to the chick are specified using empirical data. The energy content of the Ant arctic krill provided to the chick is taken to be constant or allowed to vary with size. The simulations show that food availability is most critical in the latter portion of chick development, when growth rates and food demands are high. Low food availability during this time must be compensated by either feeding chicks with larger krill of higher caloric value or by increased assimilation efficiency. Periods when small krill with lower caloric value dominate require more frequent. feeding of the chicks in order to attain their observed fledging weight. Thus, although the total food energy given to the chick is the main factor determining chick growth, the distribution of food availability relative to chick size (i.e., different net growth rates) and food quality are also factors influencing the fledging weight of penguin chicks. The simulations provide insight into the compensating effects of food delivery, food quality, and metabolic processes that allow Adelie penguin chicks to reach their observed fledging weight in spite of considerable environmental variability in food supply.

Long-term (1993-2013) changes in macrozooplankton off the Western Antarctic Peninsula	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART I-OCEANOGRAPHIC RESEARCH PAPERS												The Western Antarctic Peninsula (WAP) is one of the most rapidly warming regions on Earth, and where a high apex predator biomass is supported in large part by macrozooplankton. We examined trends in summer (January-February) abundance of major taxa of macrozooplankton along the WAP over two decades (1993-2013) and their relationship with environmental parameters (sea ice, atmospheric climate indices, sea surface temperature, and phytoplankton biomass and productivity). Macrozooplankton were collected from the top 120 m of the water column in a mid-Peninsula study region divided into latitudinal (North, South, and Far South) and cross-shelf (coastal, shelf, slope) sub-regions. Trends for krill species included a 5-year cycle in abundance peaks (positive anomalies) for Euphausia superba, but no directional long-term trend, and an increase in Thysanoessa macrura in the North; variability in both species was strongly influenced by primary production 2-years prior. E. crystallorophias abundance was best explained by the Southern Annular Mode (SAM) and Multivariate El Nino Southern Oscillation Index (MEI), and was more abundant in higher ice conditions. The salp Salpa thompsoni and thecosome pteropod Limacina helicina cycled between negative and positive anomalies in the North, but showed increasing positive anomalies in the South over time. Variation in salp and pteropod abundance was best explained by SAM and the MEI, respectively, and both species were more abundant in lower ice conditions. There was a long-term increase in some carnivorous gelatinous zooplankton (polychaete worm Tomopteris spp.) and amphipods. Abundance of Pseudosagitta spp. chaetognaths was closely related to SAM, with higher abundance tied to lower ice conditions. Longterm changes and sub-decadal cycles of WAP macrozooplankton community composition may affect energy transfer to higher trophic levels, and alter biogeochemical cycling in this seasonally productive and sensitive polar ecosystem.

Monounsaturated C-21 n-alkenes and highly branched polyunsaturated C-25 n-alkenes were analysed in the aliphatic fraction of the lipids of Antarctic pelagic and inshore marine organisms. Cluster analysis of the species-based data set produced four main groups: phytoplankton, epipelagic herbivores, epipelagic carnivores and mesopelagic omnivores. The detailed pattern of alkenes exhibited differences within the groups and also with tissue type (krill, Euphausia superba). The origin of alkenes in Antarctic biota appeared to be either synthesis de novo or due to the condensation of smaller molecules. Formation of alkenes by the decarboxylation of fatty acids was not consistent with the hydrocarbon and fatty acid composition of Antarctic zooplankton. There was no evidence for direct assimilation of C-21 and C-25 alkenes by zooplankton or higher predators from their diet. Zooplankton C-25 alkenes are probably transported unaltered directly to the sediment as detritus or via predators in faecal material. Sedimentary C-25 alkenes are proposed as biomarkers of recent zooplankton activity in the water column.																	0722-4060					APR	1995	15	4					253	259									WOS:A1995QV57000003

Observations of cetaceans in the south-east Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean, during summer 2008	POLAR BIOLOGY												Knowledge of cetacean species composition and their distribution in the south-east Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean is scarce. During a survey in February-March 2008, systematic whale sightings were carried out along transect lines following the 5 degrees and 15 degrees E meridians between 35 degrees and 67 degrees S. In total, 67 toothed whales and 126 baleen whales were observed. Both fin whales (four animals) and Antarctic minke whales Balaenoptera bonaerenses (three animals) in addition to 16 individuals of unidentified species were among the observed baleen whales. The dominating baleen whale species in our study was humpback whales Megaptera novaeangliae with 108 individuals observed. They occurred single or in groups up to seven individuals (N-mean = 2.5 ind) and eight of the counts were of calves. The relationship between humpback whale occurrence and environmental variables including Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) abundance from acoustic recordings, hydrography, bathymetry and production was tested using general additive models. Only temperature increased the predictive power of the model with whale occurrence increasing with the decreasing temperature in more southern areas.																	0722-4060	1432-2056				JUN	2014	37	6					891	895		10.1007/s00300-014-1477-y							WOS:000338278200012						
J	RODHOUSE, PG; WHITE, MG				RODHOUSE, PG; WHITE, MG			CEPHALOPODS OCCUPY THE ECOLOGICAL NICHE OF EPIPELAGIC FISH IN THE ANTARCTIC POLAR FRONTAL ZONE	BIOLOGICAL BULLETIN												Recent data from research cruises and exploratory fishing in the Antarctic Polar Frontal Zone (APFZ) of the Scotia Sea, together with data from dietary studies of Antarctic vertebrate predators, have revealed a large, previously overlooked trophic system in the Southern Ocean (Fig, 1). The nipper trophic levels of this open-ocean epipelagic community are exceptional in that they contain no fish species. Fishes are replaced by cephalopods, including the ommastrephid squid, Martialia hyadesi. This squid preys on mesopelagic myctophids (lanternfish), which feed largely on copepods. We identify here a geographically distinct, Antarctic, open-ocean food chain which is of importance to air breathing predator species but where Antarctic krill, Euphausia superba, is absent. This system is probably prevalent in al eas of higher primary productivity, especially the Scotia Sea and near the peri-Antarctic islands, Squid stocks in the APFZ may have potential for commercial exploitation, but they, and the predators they support, are likely to be sensitive to overfishing. Squid have a short, semelparous lifecycle, so overfishing in a single year can cause a stock to collapse.

Macrofauna under sea ice and in the open surface layer of the Lazarev Sea, Southern Ocean	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY												A new fishing gear was used to sample the macrozooplankton and micronekton community in the surface layer (0-2 m) under ice and in open water, the Surface and Under Ice Trawl (SUIT). In total, 57 quantitative hauls were conducted in the Lazarev Sea (Southern Ocean) during 3 different seasons (autumn 2004, winter 2006, summer 2007/2008). At least 46 species from eight phyla were caught in all 3 seasons combined. Biomass density was dominated by Antarctic krill Euphausia superba. The average biomass density was highest under the winter sea ice and lowest under the young ice in autumn. In summer, macrozooplankton biomass was dominated by ctenophores in open water and by Antarctic krill under ice. The community composition varied significantly among seasons, and according to the presence of sea ice. The response of the community composition to the presence of sea ice was influenced by species that were significantly more abundant in open water than under ice (Cyllopus lucasii, Hyperiella dilatata), only seasonally abundant under ice (Clione antarctica), or significantly associated with sea ice (Eusirus laticarpus). A number of abundant species showed distinct diel patterns in the surface occurrence both under ice and in open water, indicating that the surface layer serves as a foraging ground predominantly at night. Our results emphasize the potential of a number of non-euphausiid macrozooplankton and micronekton species to act as energy transmitters between the production of sea ice biota and the pelagic food web. By providing a regional-scale quantitative record of macrofauna under Antarctic sea ice covering 3 seasons, this study adds new and direct evidence that the ice-water interface layer is a major functional node in the ecosystem of the Antarctic seasonal sea ice zone.

Sars, 1857) was investigated in 3 contrasting (in terms of climatic and trophic conditions) areas: the Ligurian Sea, the Clyde Sea and the Kattegat. Seasonal differences in the lipid content of krill were closely related to food supply coupled with the krill reproductive state in both the Ligurian Sea and in the Clyde Sea. In the Kattegat, the lipid reserves of reproductive krill were low and probably used continuously over a longer reproduction period and successive spawning cycles. In the Ligurian and Clyde Seas, female krill lost 55 and 33% of their cephalothorax (CT) lipids through spawning. The content of triacylglycerol (TAG) and phosphatidylcholine (PC), both major lipids in the CT, were higher when food conditions were optimal at the 3 sites, and were correlated to chlorophyll a (chl a) concentration in the Ligurian and Clyde Seas. The influence of reproduction on lipid-class distribution in the Clyde and Ligurian Seas was expressed by a large decrease in PC and TAG throughout spawning, while in the Kattegat PC and TAG levels were low irrespective of the reproductive state. The relative influence of environmental and physiological factors on the lipid distribution of krill in the CT and abdomen (AB) among the 3 locations was evaluated using principal components analysis. In the CT, TAG and PC along with minor lipids were major discriminating factors and were strongly correlated to total lipid content and chl a concentrations. For reproducive krill, marked differences in the CT and AB indicated covariation between reproduction and trophic conditions. The influence of the physical environment on M. norvegica at sexual rest found expression in variation in the membrane lipids in the AB across the different temperature and salinity regimes at the 3 sites. The results are discussed in terms of adaptive mechanisms involving lipid distribution and metabolism developed by the species.																	0171-8630	1616-1599					2003	253						217	232		10.3354/meps253217							WOS:000183487200020

Bacterial epibiont communities of panmictic Antarctic krill are spatially structured	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY												Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) are amongst the most abundant animals on Earth, with a circumpolar distribution in the Southern Ocean. Genetic and genomic studies have failed to detect any population structure for the species, suggesting a single panmictic population. However, the hyper-abundance of krill slows the rate of genetic differentiation, masking potential underlying structure. Here we use high-throughput sequencing of bacterial 16S rRNA genes to show that krill bacterial epibiont communities exhibit spatial structuring, driven mainly by distance rather than environmental factors, especially for strongly krill-associated bacteria. Estimating the ecological processes driving bacterial community turnover indicated this was driven by bacterial dispersal limitation increasing with geographic distance. Furthermore, divergent epibiont communities generated from a single krill swarm split between aquarium tanks under near-identical conditions suggests physical isolation in itself can cause krill-associated bacterial communities to diverge. Our findings show that Antarctic krill-associated bacterial communities are geographically structured, in direct contrast with the lack of structure observed for krill genetic and genomic data.

Seasonal variation in the diet of Antarctic fur seals, Arctocephalus gazella, at 25 de Mayo/King George Island, South Shetland Islands, Antarctica	POLAR BIOLOGY												Assessing the trophic ecology of fur seals is essential for defining their roles as a top predator in Antarctic marine ecosystems. To this end, we examined the diet of Antarctic fur seals, Arctocephalus gazella, in the South Shetlands. While previous studies have considered the diet of this species at this location in summer, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to report on the diet of this population in winter, thus adding essential information on the extent of seasonal variation. A total of 224 scats were collected in the winter 2004 (n = 118) and summer 2004/2005 (n = 106) on the coasts of Stranger Point, Isla 25 de Mayo/King George. For the total study period krill (Euphausia superba) was the main prey taxon, followed by fish, cephalopods and penguins. During winter Pleuragramma antarcticum was dominant, while myctophids were almost absent. Conversely, in summer Electrona antarctica and Gymnoscopelus nicholsi, followed by P. antarcticum, dominated the fish diet. It is concluded that fur seals centred their foraging activity on a krill community and fish associated with krill aggregations.																	0722-4060	1432-2056				FEB	2017	40	2					471	475		10.1007/s00300-016-1959-1							WOS:000393761500020						
J	Nygard, T; Lie, E; Rov, N; Steinnes, E				Nygard, T; Lie, E; Rov, N; Steinnes, E			Metal dynamics in an Antarctic food chain	MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN												The concentrations of copper, zinc, cadmium, selenium and mercury were determined in eggs, muscle, liver, kidney and stomach content of nestlings and adults of the Antarctic petrel, Thalassoica antarctica, and its predator, the south polar skua, Chataracta maccormicki, from Svarthamaren, Dronning Maud Land, Antarctica. The dominant food of the petrels is krill, Euphausia superba. The results show relatively high levels of cadmium in krill, which is assumed to be the main reason for the high levels of cadmium in petrels and skuas. Cadmium is almost absent in eggs, but accumulates very rapidly with age in nestlings. The copper concentrations in livers of nestling petrels reach very high levels during growth. This may be seen in connection with physiological development processes. Mercury seems to be accumulated with age and between trophic levels. Among the nestlings, the mercury levels decrease with increasing age, which may be accomplished by the excretion of mercury through the growth of feathers and as a dilution effect during growth. Selenium and mercury are inversely correlated in nestlings. The levels of zinc were similar for different nestling stages and between nestlings and adults in skuas and petrels.

From 18 February to 9 March 2002, mean total target strengths (TTS 10 log(sigma(t)/4pi)), were measured from groups of 57-1169 krill (average standard length 31.6 turn; standard deviation = 6.6 mm) at the Cape Shirreff field station, Livingston Island, Antarctica, and aboard RV "Yuzhmorgeologiya". Chirp pulses were transmitted sequentially by an omni-directional emitter into one of three glass carboys containing groups of krill swimming in 9.3, 19.3, or 45.9 liters of seawater (0.6degreesC less than or equal totemperatureless than or equal to 4.0degreesC). Between each pulse the krill moved within the fixed-boundary tank and the modulated reverberations were sensed bi-statically with three omni-directional receivers. At each center frequency (f(c)) the coherent energy in 200-pulse ensembles identified sound scattered by the tank. The incoherent energy described total sound scattering from the krill, Thus, the TTS at each f(c) was extracted from a correlation analysis of energy reverberated in the tank. Measurement bias was determined to be +/-0.4 dB from an experiment using metal sphere reference targets, and the precision was estimated as +/-0.8 dB from the variability in the krill TTS (f(c)) measurements. The empirical estimates of mean sigma(t) corroborated a krill-scattering model based on the distorted-wave Born approximation (DWBA), enhanced by the authors to account for the stochastic nature of sound scattering (SDWBA), integrated over all scattering angles and averaged over all incident angles (SDWBA(TTS)). The SDWBA, solved for target strength of Antarctic krill, may be the best predictor of backscatter for this important species and may also provide backscattering spectra for improving their acoustic identification. These advances may help to reduce uncertainty in krill-biomass estimation using multi-frequency echosounder data and echo-integration methods.

After a 9-week feeding trial, results showed that the specific growth rate and feed efficiency ratio were not negatively affected by dietary krill meal levels. Increasing levels of dietary krill meal linearly and quadratically increased significantly FI (P < .05). Significant positive linear trends were found between the increasing levels of dietary krill meal and carotenoid concentrations, redness (a*), yellowness (b*) in skin (P < .05). And the color can be distinguished by the human eye when 15% fishmeal protein was replaced by krill meal protein due to the total color difference (Delta E) was > 3. Texture and pH in muscle were not negatively affected, however, liquid holding capacity linearly decreased (P < .05). The increasing dietary krill meal resulted in a linear decrease in most of free amino acids and a linear increase in inosinic acid (P < .05). The concentrations of EPA was linearly increased with the increasing krill meal level, n-3/n-6 ratio ranged from 0.68-0.91 within the human dietary requirements. Total amino acid profile kept unchanged among all the treatments. Although the increase of dietary krill meal significantly linearly increased the content of fluorine in muscle (P < .05), the highest content was within the safe edible limit for human. The expression levels of mTOR, 4E-BP1, eIF4E, S6K1, S6 genes related to TOR signaling pathway and phosphorylation of mTOR were not significantly changed among all treatment. These results suggested that Antarctic krill meal could be a viable alternative dietary protein source for large yellow croaker. And 6.59%-32.93% of dietary krill meal can result in a better skin color and fatty acid nutritional value in muscle without negative effects on growth performance of large yellow croaker.																	0044-8486	1873-5622				OCT 15	2019	512								734281	10.1016/j.aquaculture.2019.734281							WOS:000491992200013

Sensitivity analysis identifies high influence sites for estimates of penguin krill consumption on the Antarctic Peninsula	ANTARCTIC SCIENCE												Krill consumption by natural predators represents a critical link between surveys and models of standing krill biomass and the design of a sustainable krill fishery for the Scotia Sea. Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) is a significant component of diet for penguins breeding in this region and, consequently, uncertainties regarding penguin population abundances contribute to uncertainties in krill predation estimates. We use a comprehensive database of Antarctic penguin abundances to identify 14 breeding colonies that contribute most significantly to uncertainty regarding the total number of pygoscelid penguins breeding in this region. We find that a high quality survey of Zavodovski Island alone would decrease uncertainty in total population by 24.8%, whereas high quality surveys of all 14 "high-influence" locations would decrease uncertainty by almost 72%. Updated population estimates at these sites should be considered top priority for future fieldwork in the region. Our results are based on a robust quantitative method for assessing data priorities in estimating krill consumption that is easily extended to other groups of krill predators.																	0954-1020	1365-2079				FEB	2013	25	1					19	23		10.1017/S0954102012000600							WOS:000314147700004

Habitat partitioning in Antarctic krill: Spawning hotspots and nursery areas	PLOS ONE												Antarctic krill, Euphausia superba, have a circumpolar distribution but are concentrated within the south-west Atlantic sector, where they support a unique food web and a commercial fishery. Within this sector, our first goal was to produce quantitative distribution maps of all six ontogenetic life stages of krill (eggs, nauplii plus metanauplii, calyptopes, furcilia, juveniles, and adults), based on a compilation of all available post 1970s data. Using these maps, we then examined firstly whether "hotspots" of egg production and early stage nursery occurred, and secondly whether the available habitat was partitioned between the successive life stages during the austral summer and autumn, when krill densities can be high. To address these questions, we compiled larval krill density records and extracted data spanning 41 years (1976-2016) from the existing KRILLBASE-abundance and KRILLBASE-length-frequency databases. Although adult males and females of spawning age were widely distributed, the distribution of eggs, nauplii and metanauplii indicates that spawning is most intense over the shelf and shelf slope. This contrasts with the distributions of calyptope and furcilia larvae, which were concentrated further offshore, mainly in the Southern Scotia Sea. Juveniles, however, were strongly concentrated over shelves along the Scotia Arc. Simple environmental analyses based on water depth and mean water temperature suggest that krill associate with different habitats over the course of their life cycle. From the early to late part of the austral season, juvenile distribution moves from ocean to shelf, opposite in direction to that for adults. Such habitat partitioning may reduce intraspecific competition for food, which has been suggested to occur when densities are exceptionally high during years of strong recruitment. It also prevents any potential cannibalism by adults on younger stages. Understanding the location of krill spawning and juvenile development in relation to potentially overlapping fishing activities is needed to protect the health of the south-west Atlantic sector ecosystem.

Data collected during 14 demersal fish surveys, from 1986 to 2006, are analysed to investigate biomass, distribution, growth and diet. Biomass estimates from a swept area method ranged from 4,462 to 28,740 tonnes on the South Georgia and Shag Rock shelves although few fish were caught at Shag Rocks. Analysis of length frequency data indicated that growth was fast in the first five years with males and females attaining lengths at first spawning of 440 mm TL and 520 mm TL. The diet was comprised of fish and crustaceans, with an ontogenetic shift in diet from Euphausia superba and mysids to benthic fish and decapods observed to begin at 250 mm TL. In larger fish (> 500 mm TL) the diet was dominated by fish. C. aceratus diet is sufficiently different from the other species of channichthyids around South Georgia to suggest that these species have undergone resource partitioning.				, Martin/ABE-6728-2020; Collins, Martin A/J-8560-2017; Reid, William/J-8528-2013	Reid, William/0000-0003-0190-0425												0722-4060	1432-2056				NOV	2007	30	12					1523	1533		10.1007/s00300-007-0313-z							WOS:000249920800002						
J	Nicol, S; Endo, Y				Nicol, S; Endo, Y			Krill fisheries: Development, management and ecosystem implications	AQUATIC LIVING RESOURCES												There are currently at least six commercial fisheries harvesting six different species of euphausiid, or krill: Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba), fished in the Antarctic; North Pacific krill (Euphausia pacifica), fished off Japan and off western Canada; Euphausia nana, fished off the coast of Japan; Thysanoessa inermis, fished off the coast of Japan and off eastern Canada; and Thysanoessa raschii and Meganyctiphanes norvegica which have been experimentally harvested off eastern Canada. The current world catch of all species of krill is over 150 000 tonnes per annum but few fisheries are being exploited to their maximum theoretical potential. The size of the world krill harvest is currently limited by lack of demand, although some fisheries are being deliberately managed at low levels because of ecological concerns. We have outlined the history of these krill fisheries to determine where there are common trends and issues which will affect their future development. Krill products are currently mostly used for the aquaculture and sport fishing market but considerable effort has also been put into developing products for human consumption, particularly from Antarctic krill. The future development of krill fisheries is examined in the light of information on trends in krill products which include pharmaceutical and industrial uses in addition to nutritional products. Because of the central ecological role of krill in many marine ecosystems, the subject of krill harvesting is a sensitive issue and krill fisheries require careful management. This requirement has spawned an innovative international management regime in the Antarctic - the Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR) - which has developed procedures for managing the harvest of Antarctic krill that may be applicable to other fisheries. The common problems of managing krill fisheries are outlined particularly those relating to the role of krill in many coastal ecosystems, and as prey for many other species which are commercially fished.

Variability of euphausiid larvae densities during the 2011, 2012, and 2014 summer seasons in the Atlantic sector of the Antarctic	POLAR SCIENCE												Euphausiid larvae were collected in the Weddell Scotia Confluence region in summer 2011, in the West Antarctic Peninsula and Scotia Sea in 2012, and in the South Orkneys Shelf in 2014. From 2011 to 2014 the larval stages geographic distribution and the distribution of water masses were consistent with published information. The densities observed were compared between the cruises and with the 1981 and 1995 values by means of a kernel estimate of absolute and relative densities at a fixed grid of points. The values of Thysanoessa macrura were higher in 2011 and 2012 and those of Euphausia superba were lower than those observed in 1981 and 1995. Euphausia frigida did not show significant variations in absolute density but their relative values were higher than those of E. superba. No significant variations were observed in absolute values between 1981 and 1995. The opposite pattern was found in 2014, with significantly higher densities of E. superba than those of T. macrura. No single factor could be identified to explain these variations in density, suggesting the existence of complex mechanisms coupling the reproductive biology with oceanographic phenomena. Their description will require ample spatial and temporal monitoring rather than locally detailed observations.

J	HOSIE, GW				HOSIE, GW			DISTRIBUTION AND ABUNDANCE OF EUPHAUSIID LARVAE IN THE PRYDZ BAY REGION, ANTARCTICA	ANTARCTIC SCIENCE												In January 1985 a net sampling survey was carried out on the distribution and abundance of euphausiid larvae in the Prydz Bay region. Euphausia superba occurred in low abundance, probably due to sampling preceding the main spawning period. Thysanoessa macrura occurred thorughout the study area in consistently high abundance. Euphausia crystallorophias was marginally more abundant within its restricted range. Distinct north-south variations in larval age and developmental stages of T. macrura were observed indicating regional differences in spawning. Euphausia frigida was mainly confined to the upper 200 m of the antarctic Circumpolar Current. E. superba larvae produced north of the shelf break, between 70-degrees-83-degrees-E, moved north-east into the Antarctic Circumpolar Current. Larvae originating on the shelf moved rapidly west in the East Wind drift. E. crystallorophias has the same westward dispersion, but some larvae appeared to return eastward via the Prydz Bay Gyre and remain in the region. The data indicate that most E. superba larvae, providing they survive injurious cold temperature and food deprivation, will leave the area, suggests that Prydz Bay krill may not be a self maintaining stock.																	0954-1020					JUN	1991	3	2					167	180		10.1017/S0954102091000202							WOS:A1991FR41900005

Ross seal (Ommatophoca rossii) annual distribution, diving behaviour, breeding and moulting, off Queen Maud Land, Antarctica	POLAR BIOLOGY												Six out of ten adult Ross seals that were tagged with Argos satellite-linked dive recorders off Queen Maud Land, just after the moult in February, provided data on location and diving activity throughout a year. Shortly after tagging, the animals headed 2,000 km north and stayed pelagic in the area south of the Antarctic Polar Front, until October when they went south into the pack-ice. Throughout the year they made about 100 dives a day, most to a depth of 100-300 m, the deepest dive on record being 792 m, while some dives were very shallow during their stay in the pack-ice. Most dives, outside the breeding and moulting period, lasted for 5-15 min throughout the year. This diving behaviour is consistent with feeding on mid-water fish, like Pleurogramma antarcticum, squid, and to some extent krill (Euphausia superba), when in the pack-ice, and myctophid fish and several species of squid, when in the open ocean. The nursing period was 13 days in mid-November, and moulting occurs in late January-early February, which is the period when sightings surveys for this species should be done.																	0722-4060	1432-2056				OCT	2007	30	11					1449	1458		10.1007/s00300-007-0306-y							WOS:000249306800009

The ecotoxicological risk of zooplanktonic communities, estimated by the modern methodological approach of biomarkers, can be used as an early warning signal of ecosystem health. The aim of this project is to estimate the potential use of several biomarkers (esterases, mixed function oxidases, porphyrins) in zooplanktonic organisms. Studies were carried out with different zooplanktonic crustaceans: the copepods Acartia margalefi and Acartia latisetosa collected in Ganzirri Lake (Messina); the mysid Siriella clausi collected in Faro Lake (Messina); the mysids Diamysis bahirensis, Siriella armata and Mysidopsis gibbosa collected in Stagnone di Marsala (Palermo); the Antarctic euphausiids Euphausia crystallorophias and Euphausia superba; the amphipod Streetsia challengeri and the euphausiid Meganycthiphanes norvegica collected after a shore-stranding along Messina's Ionian coast. Moreover, experiments were carried out with the benthic decapods Eriphia verrucosa and Pachygrapsus marmoratus from a rocky shore of Messina's Ionian coast. Acetylcholinesterase activity (AChE) was determined in homogenates of whole organisms. The key result of this project concerns the different AChE activity basal values of different crustacean species. Particular attention should be paid to the difference in basal activity found between the Antarctic and the Mediterranean species.

The diet of both species was dominated by crustaceans, in particular euphausiids (mainly Euphausia superba and some Thysanoessa), which contributed 47-76% of the biomass of crustaceans in the diet of P. georgicus, and copepods, which contributed 71% of the biomass of crustaceans in the diet of P. urinatrix. Calanoides acutus was the most numerous copepod in the diet of both species; however, Rhincalanus gigas was more common in P. urinatrix than in P. georgicus. The dominant amphipod in the diet of P. georgicus, Primno macropa, was absent from the diet of Pelecanoides urinatrix, in which Themisto gaudichaudii (rare in Pelecanoides georgicus) dominated. Dietary differences were maintained in the period (2 weeks of a total of 10 weeks) when both species were simultaneously rearing chicks. Knowledge of the prey species and of the diving abilities and foraging habits of diving petrels suggests that at South Georgia Pelecanoides urinatrix feeds closer inshore and dives deeper than Pelecarnoides georgicus.																	0722-4060					JAN	1997	17	1					17	24		10.1007/s003000050100							WOS:A1997VW97200003

Advective pathways near the tip of the Antarctic Peninsula: Trends, variability and ecosystem implications	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART I-OCEANOGRAPHIC RESEARCH PAPERS												Pathways and rates of ocean flow near the Antarctic Peninsula are strongly affected by frontal features, forcings from the atmosphere and the cryosphere. In the surface mixed layer, the currents advect material from the northwestern Weddell Sea on the eastern side of the Peninsula around the tip of the Peninsula to its western side and into the Scotia Sea, connecting populations of Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) and supporting the ecosystem of the region. Modelling of subsurface drifters using a particle tracking algorithm forced by the velocity fields of a coupled sea ice-ocean model (ORCA025-LIM2) allows analysis of the seasonal and interannual variability of drifter pathways over 43 years. The results show robust and persistent connections from the Weddell Sea both to the west into the Bellingshausen Sea and across the Scotia Sea towards South Georgia, reproducing well the observations. The fate of the drifters is sensitive to their deployment location, in addition to other factors. From the shelf of the eastern Antarctic Peninsula, the majority enter the Bransfield Strait and subsequently the Bellingshausen Sea. When originating further offshore over the deeper Weddell Sea, drifters are more likely to cross the South Scotia Ridge and reach South Georgia. However, the wind field east and southeast of Elephant Island, close to the tip of the Peninsula, is crucial for the drifter trajectories and is highly influenced by the Southern Annular Mode (SAM). Increased advection and short travel times to South Georgia, and reduced advection to the western Antarctic Peninsula can be linked to strong westerlies, a signature of the positive phase of the SAM. The converse is true for the negative phase. Strong westerlies and shifts of ocean fronts near the tip of the Peninsula that are potentially associated with both the SAM and the El Nino-Southern Oscillation restrict the connection from the Weddell Sea to the west, and drifters then predominantly follow the open paths to South Georgia and the east. Over the 43-year time series, the number of drifters advected into the Bellingshausen Sea decreases significantly by 23% and the travel time to South Georgia shortens significantly by 19% which corresponds to 56 days. We propose that these trends are linked, at least in part, to the increasingly positive trend in the SAM and, as such, this suggests an additional anthropogenic source of change to the regional ecosystem.

Within the Southern Ocean, Antarctic krill (Euphausia Superba) support many marine predators and play a key role in the biogeochemical cycle. Ocean acidification and plastic pollution have been acknowledged to hinder Antarctic krill development and physiology in singularity, however potential multi-stressor effects of plastic particulates coupled with ocean acidification are unexplored. Furthermore, Antarctic krill may be especially vulnerable to plastic pollution due to their close association with sea-ice, a known plastic sink. Here, we investigate the behaviour of nanoplastic [spherical, aminated (NH2), and yellow-green fluorescent polystyrene nanoparticles] in Antarctic seawater and explore the single and combined effects of nanoplastic (160 nm radius, at a concentration of 2.5 mu g ml(-1)) and ocean acidification (pCO(2) similar to 900, pH(T) 7.7) on the embryonic development of Antarctic krill. Gravid female krill were collected in the Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean (North Scotia Sea). Produced eggs were incubated at 0.5 degrees C in four treatments (control, nanoplastic, ocean acidification and the multi-stressor scenario of nanoplastic presence, and ocean acidification) and their embryonic development after 6 days, at the incubation endpoint, was determined. We observed that negatively charged nanoplastic particles suspended in seawater from the Scotia Sea aggregated to sizes exceeding the nanoscale after 24 h (1054.13 +/- 53.49 nm). Further, we found that the proportion of embryos developing through the early stages to reach at least the limb bud stage was highest in the control treatment (21.84%) and lowest in the multi-stressor treatment (13.17%). Since the biological thresholds to any stressors can be altered by the presence of additional stressors, we propose that future nanoplastic ecotoxicology studies should consider the changing global ocean under future climate scenarios for assessments of their impact and highlight that determining the behaviour of nanoplastic particles used in incubation studies is critical to determining their toxicity.																		2296-7745				AUG 3	2021	8								709763	10.3389/fmars.2021.709763							WOS:000686142500001

Biology of the Antarctic dragonfish Vomeridens infuscipinnis (Notothenioidei: Bathydraconidae)	ANTARCTIC SCIENCE												Nineteen specimens of the rare dragonfish Vomeridens infuscipinnis were evaluated for meristic counts, morphometric measurements, vomerine teeth and the supratemporal canal, anatomical and histological observations of bone, cartilage and lipid, diet, and reproductive status. Seven individuals were measured for buoyancy. All specimens had small vomerine teeth that varied in number. There was also variability in the arrangement of the supratemporal pores and canals. Vomeridens possess a body with little bone and considerable amounts of cartilage and lipid. A mean percentage buoyancy of 1.61% indicated that Vomeridens is nearly neutrally buoyant. Inferences from measurements of buoyancy and from morphological data suggest that Vomeridens lives in an epibenthic water column habitat at 400-900 m. Facilitated by its reduced body density, Vomeridens are likely to forage in the water column by hovering above the substrate. The stomach contents consisted of krill (Euphausia superba), some as large as 46-50 mm. The absolute and relative fecundity in seven female was 1576-2296 oocytes (mean 1889) and 21.3-28.9 oocytes g(-1) body weight (mean 25.3), respectively. The reproductive effort in terms of egg diameter, GSI, and absolute and relative fecundity is similar to that for other bathydraconids.

The glacially sculpted coastline along the peninsula is highly convoluted and characterized by deep embayments that are often interconnected by channels that facilitate transport of heat and nutrients into the shelf domain. The ecosystem is divided into three subregions, the continental slope, shelf and coastal regions, each with unique ocean dynamics, water mass and biological distributions. The WAP shelf lies within the Antarctic Sea Ice Zone (SIZ) and like other SIZs, the WAP system is very productive, supporting large stocks of marine mammals, birds and the Antarctic krill, Euphausia superba. Ecosystem dynamics is dominated by the seasonal and interannual variation in sea ice extent and retreat. The Antarctic Peninsula is one among the most rapidly warming regions on Earth, having experienced a 2 degrees C increase in the annual mean temperature and a 6 degrees C rise in the mean winter temperature since 1950. Delivery of heat from the Antarctic Circumpolar Current has increased significantly in the past decade, sufficient to drive to a 0.6 degrees C warming of the upper 300 m of shelf water. In the past 50 years and continuing in the twenty-first century, the warm, moist maritime climate of the northern WAP has been migrating south, displacing the once dominant cold, dry continental Antarctic climate and causing multi-level responses in the marine ecosystem. Ecosystem responses to the regional warming include increased heat transport, decreased sea ice extent and duration, local declines in ice-dependent Adelie penguins, increase in ice-tolerant gentoo and chinstrap penguins, alterations in phytoplankton and zooplankton community composition and changes in krill recruitment, abundance and availability to predators. The climate/ecological gradients extending along the WAP and the presence of monitoring systems, field stations and long-term research programmes make the region an invaluable observatory of climate change and marine ecosystem response.

J	MAKAROV, RR; MENSHENINA, LL				MAKAROV, RR; MENSHENINA, LL			LARVAE OF EUPHAUSIIDS OFF QUEEN-MAUD-LAND	POLAR BIOLOGY												In a March 1981 study of the Lazare Sea, a sector of the Southern Ocean along Queen Maud Land, Euphausia superba and Thysanoessa macrura larvae were abundant in the north and northwest part of the region near the frontal zone between the Weddell Warm Countercurrent (WWC) and Weddell Gyre, 5-degrees-W-15-degrees-E. Toward the south, E. superba and E. crystallorophias larvae were numerous in the frontal zone between the WWC and the Antarctic Coastal Current. Only T. macrura larvae occurred in the central part of the sea. The age composition of larvae was most advanced in T. macrura, probably due to the drift of larvae from the northwest. Because the ice cover diminishes later in the flow from the Weddell Gyre (northernmost area of the region) than in the south, E. superba larvae were younger in that oceanic subregion than near the shore. T. macrura larvae were sparse near the coast and an onshore-offshore age difference was not pronounced. Both frontal zones correspond to reproductive areas of E. superba and T. macrura. E. crystallorophias spawns only in the southern area.																	0722-4060	1432-2056				MAR	1992	11	8					515	523									WOS:A1992HN49900001

The seals primarily foraged within two depth layers, these being from the sea surface to 160 m where temperature and salinity varied considerably, and near the bottom from 340 to 450 m where temperature was lowest and salinity highest. While both pelagic and benthic diving occurred during daylight, the seals foraged almost exclusively in the upper water column at night. Trawling during daytime confirmed that Pleuragramma antarcticum were by far the most abundant fish both in the pelagial and close to the bottom. Pelagic night hauls at 110-170 m depth showed highly variable biomass of P. antarcticum. The temporal changes in the local abundance of P. antarcticum, particularly in the pelagial, may explain the trends in the seals' pelagic and benthic foraging activities. This study describes the Jaw movements of a hunting seal, which are presumably indicative of feeding events. Trophic links from the Weddell seal to fish, zooplankton and krill, Euphausia superba, are discussed.

Acoustic determination of the distribution of fish and krill across the Scotia Sea in spring 2006, summer 2008 and autumn 2009	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY												Multifrequency acoustic backscatter data were examined from transects at eight stations across the Scotia Sea, from the South Orkneys to the north west of South Georgia. These transects were repeated in austral spring (November 2006), summer (December 2007/January 2008) and autumn (March 2009). A dB identification window (Sv120-38) identified two types of scatterers dominating the acoustic backscatter; a positive Sv120-38 indicative of Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) and a negative Sv120-38 indicative of mesopelagic fish with swim bladders, such as myctophids. Acoustic backscatter attributed to schooling myctophid fish was greater at stations in the north of the Scotia Sea across all seasons and found to increase significantly with increasing mean sea temperature and absolute dynamic height. A schools analysis identified more fish schools at the stations with high fish acoustic backscatter. The number of fish schools increased, were distributed further south, and occurred deeper from spring through to autumn. Krill density, calculated using a target strength model, was similar in spring (27.7 g m(-2)) and summer (27.2 g m(-2)), but lower (2.2 g m(-2)) in autumn 2009. An analysis of swarm characteristics showed that during the spring cruise the high mean krill density resulted from a small number of swarms containing a large number of small krill, particularly in the south of the survey region. In contrast in the summer cruise the high mean krill density resulted from a large number of swarms containing a low number of large krill. Finally, in autumn the low krill density resulted from a small number of swarms containing a small number of large krill. Krill swarms were located at a mean depth of 58 m in spring, 94 m in summer and 123 m in autumn and were generally further apart, deeper, contained fewer krill and smaller in the north of the survey region. Large-scale shifts in the latitudinal and vertical distribution of krill and schooling mesopelagic fish in the Scotia Sea were observed. This seasonal reorganisation in both horizontal and vertical distribution will alter the role of these prey items in the ecosystem. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Total body oxygen stores were estimated from measures of hematocrit, hemoglobin, myoglobin, and total blood volume and were used to calculate an aerobic dive limit (ADL). Movement patterns and diving behavior were measured by equipping the seal with a Satellite Relay Data Logger that transmitted data from 8-31 August 2002. The seal remained in a focal area, in contrast to crabeater seals tracked simultaneously. The seal displayed short, shallow dives (mean 2.0 +/- 1.4 min, 44 +/- 48 m) and spent 99.9% of its time within the estimated ADL of 7.4 min. The shallow diving behavior contradicts previous diet research suggesting Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) is the primary prey of leopard seals during the winter months as krill were found at deeper depths during this period. These measurements of diving and movement of a leopard seal provide valuable preliminary data necessary to develop future research on the at-sea behavior of an apex predator in the Antarctic ecosystem.

Blocking primers to enhance PCR amplification of rare sequences in mixed samples - a case study on prey DNA in Antarctic krill stomachs	FRONTIERS IN ZOOLOGY												Background: Identification of DNA sequence diversity is a powerful means for assessing the species present in environmental samples. The most common molecular strategies for estimating taxonomic composition depend upon PCR with universal primers that amplify an orthologous DNA region from a range of species. The diversity of sequences within a sample that can be detected by universal primers is often compromised by high concentrations of some DNA templates. If the DNA within the sample contains a small number of sequences in relatively high concentrations, then less concentrated sequences are often not amplified because the PCR favours the dominant DNA types. This is a particular problem in molecular diet studies, where predator DNA is often present in great excess of food-derived DNA. Results: We have developed a strategy where a universal PCR simultaneously amplifies DNA from food items present in DNA purified from stomach samples, while the predator's own DNA is blocked from amplification by the addition of a modified predator-specific blocking primer. Three different types of modified primers were tested out; one annealing inhibiting primer overlapping with the 3' end of one of the universal primers, another annealing inhibiting primer also having an internal modification of five dI molecules making it a dual priming oligo, and a third elongation arrest primer located between the two universal primers. All blocking primers were modified with a C3 spacer. In artificial PCR mixtures, annealing inhibiting primers proved to be the most efficient ones and this method reduced predator amplicons to undetectable levels even when predator template was present in 1000 fold excess of the prey template. The prey template then showed strong PCR amplification where none was detectable without the addition of blocking primer. Our method was applied to identifying the winter food of one of the most abundant animals in the world, the Antarctic krill, Euphausia superba. Dietary item DNA was PCR amplified from a range of species in krill stomachs for which we had no prior sequence knowledge. Conclusion: We present a simple, robust and cheap method that is easily adaptable to many situations where a rare DNA template is to be PCR amplified in the presence of a higher concentration template with identical PCR primer binding sites.

Density and distribution of euphausiid larvae in the Scotia Sea in the 2011 summer	POLAR BIOLOGY												Monitoring of early euphausiid larvae provides valuable information on the mechanisms involved in recruitment to the adult populations. As the Antarctic is undergoing rapid environmental change, these mechanisms are key to ecosystem-based management of the krill fishery. We analyzed the distribution and abundance of early euphausiid larvae (calyptopes I to late furciliae) from 76 plankton samples from surface to 300 m depth in the Atlantic sector in January 2011 in relation with a previous survey and published information. Thysanoessa macrura (mean density: 209 ind m(-2)) dominated the sampling while Euphausia superba (mean density: 13.63 ind m(-2)) and Euphausia frigida (mean density: 10.05 ind m(-2)) were also present. T. macrura density increased while E. superba experienced a high decrease respect to historical data. Clustering of stations and correspondence analysis showed that the associations of larvae and water masses are in agreement with literature reports, so the differences on the abundance of early larvae are within the observed variability and cannot be attributed to any single factor, suggesting that it is due to more subtle changes such as the stability of the water column and/or vorticity in the fronts.

A vessel-mounted acoustic Doppler current profiler (ADCP) and a calibrated EK-60 echo sounder were used to assess circulation patterns and krill distributions in the bay, and a multiple opening and closing net (with 333 mu m mesh) and environmental sensing system (MOCNESS) was used to collect live samples of mesozooplankton and krill for taxonomic composition analysis. The results from this field study complement a previous one that examined an anticyclonic bay-scale circulation of Antarctic krill. This super-aggregation of krill covered similar to 100 km(2), had a concentration of 1000s of individuals m(-2) and was associated with more than 306 humpback whales present in Wilhelmina Bay. Our results from the mesozooplankton study revealed that krill continuously conducted diel vertical migrations and formed aggregations in the inner bay, while the chlorophyll concentration at the surface decreased from 2.2 to 0.6 g C m(-2) due to the decrease of daylight, and zooplankton concentrations increased from 0.5 to 1.5 g C m(-2) probably from advective influx. Most zooplankton were distributed below 200 m while krill fed in the upper 150 m. The spatial and temporal correlations between krill and small-to medium-sized mesozooplankton imply that krill may become omnivorous when there is a lack of phytoplankton in the late austral fall. Though both phytoplankton and zooplankton biomasses contributed only small fractions of the daily ration needed for krill metabolism in Wilhelmina Bay, it is not clear what caused krill to aggregate on such a large scale, as this led to high mortality as a result of starvation and predation by whales and other top predators.

J	Goss, C; Middleton, D; Rodhouse, P				Goss, C; Middleton, D; Rodhouse, P			Investigations of squid stocks using acoustic survey methods	FISHERIES RESEARCH					1st International Symposium on Pacific Squids	OCT, 1999	TRUJILLO, PERU	IMARPE				Acoustic survey methods are now widely used for stock assessments of finfish, both those with and without swimbladders, but their application to squid stocks has been limited in the past, probably because squid are not particularly strong targets for detection with echosounders. Experience with acoustic stock assessment of krill (Euphausia superba) has revealed that it is possible to survey effectively for a species that is a weaker target than squid; this is partly due to the tendency for krill to form dense aggregations. This paper discusses examples of acoustic studies on different squid species from the South Atlantic (Loligo gahi, Martialia hyadesi) and demonstrates that squid detection is possible in widely differing locations. L gahi observed during a survey on the Falkland Shelf were shown to have acoustic characteristics in common with smaller organisms which may enable them to be distinguished acoustically from finfish encountered in these waters. When a species has been characterised acoustically, the technique permits rapid surveys of large areas to determine the geographic range of a population, both outside the usual area that can be surveyed using fishing methods and within areas that are inaccessible to nets for some reason.

J	Catard, A; Weimerskirch, H; Cherel, Y				Catard, A; Weimerskirch, H; Cherel, Y			Exploitation of distant Antarctic waters and close shelf-break waters by white-chinned petrels rearing chicks	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												The foraging ecology of white-chinned petrels Procellaria aequinoctialis rearing chicks was examined at the Crozet Islands in the Southern Ocean. based on satellite tracking, diet and provisioning studies. White-chinned petrels from the Crozet Islands exploit a wide variety of marine environments ranging from sub-tropical waters to the limit of pack-ice at the edge of the Antarctic continent. This capability was made possible by the use of a 2-fold strategy whereby adults exploit alternatively distant oceanic waters and neritic slope waters in the vicinity of the breeding grounds. On average the birds conducted a long foraging trip followed by 2.2 short trips. During trips of long duration over oceanic waters, birds tended to commute mainly to cold, deep Antarctic waters where most foraging activity took place. They commuted from and returned to Crozet at high speeds (mean 31 and 34 km h(-1) respectively) with a mean foraging range of 1868 km (maximum 2421 km). In Antarctic waters, the white-chimed petrel appears to feed mainly on pelagic fishes and on Antarctic krill Euphausia superba and concentrates its efforts in waters with sea-surface temperatures of 2 degrees C. During short trips the birds commuted to the Crozet shelf break, where they fed mainly on fish. Diet samples delivered to chicks after short trips indicate that adults relied at least in part on food made available by longliners as baits and discards. Despite its small size compared to albatrosses, the white-chinned petrel from Crozet appears to be a particularly wide-ranging species and an opportunistic feeder in terms of the marine environment exploited, which explains its wide distribution in the Southern Ocean. This study highlights the particular importance of Antarctic waters for this sub-Antarctic species during the chide-rearing period, i.e. in summer when the retreat of the pack-ice makes abundant resources such as Antarctic krill available.

ENZYME REGULATION OF SELECTED CRUSTACEANS WITH REGARD TO TEMPERATURE ADAPTATION	JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE PHYSIOLOGY B-BIOCHEMICAL SYSTEMIC AND ENVIRONMENTAL PHYSIOLOGY												The characteristics and properties of chromatographically purified citrate synthase from the euphausiids Euphausia superba (Antarctica) and Meganyctiphanes norvegica (Scandinavian Kattegat and Mediterranean Sea) and from the isopods Serolis polita (Antarctica) and Idotea baltica (Baltic Sea) were used to elucidate biochemical mechanisms of temperature adaptation. Additionally, maintenance experiments were carried out on the euphausiids to determine mechanisms of short term acclimation. Temperature optima (between 37 and 45 degrees C) were unrelated to genotypic cold adaptation, but the activation energy of the Antarctic krill E. superba (10.9 kJ . mol(-1)) was only a quarter of that in other species (41.8-45.1 kJ . mol(-1)). The minima of apparent Michaelis constants (total range: 4-20 mu mol . l(-1) oxaloacetate: 7-45 mu mol . l(-1) acetyl-coenzyme A) showed no relation to natural conditions, and no distinct pH optimum occurred at ambient temperatures. In contrast. apparent Michaelis constants and specific enzyme activities were related to maintenance temperatures in M. norvegica but not in E. superba. The differences between M. norvegica and E. superba can be interpreted as adaptations to the changes in ambient temperature with regard to the respective steno- and eurythermic tolerances of these crustaceans.																	0174-1578	1432-136X				APR	1995	165	1					46	55		10.1007/BF00264685							WOS:A1995QX90900006

Summertime grazing impact of the dominant macrozooplankton off the Western Antarctic Peninsula	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART I-OCEANOGRAPHIC RESEARCH PAPERS												The Western Antarctic Peninsula (WAP) is a region of rapid climate change that is altering plankton community structure. To investigate how these changes may impact carbon and energy transfer in the pelagic food web, grazing rates of the five dominant macrozooplankton species (euphausiids Euphausia superba, Euphausia crystallorophias, and Thysanoessa macrura; the pteropod Limacina helicina, and the salp Salpa thompsoni) in the WAP were measured in January 2009 and 2010 as part of the Palmer Antarctica Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) study. Measurements were made across the coastal-shelf-offshore and north south gradients of the LTER survey grid. Highest grazing rates occurred offshore in both years, and in the south during 2009 and north during 2010, all associated with the presence of large localized salp blooms. During both years, E. superba was the major grazer at the coast, while S. thompsoni dominated grazing offshore. L. helicina was an important grazer throughout the study area during both years, but especially so over the shelf during 2009. During 2009, there was little difference in the relative importance of the rnacrozooplankton grazers along the north south gradient. The presence of a salp bloom in the north during 2010, though, resulted in a distinct shift in the relative importance of major grazers from the euphausiids and L. helicina in the south to salps in the north. Grazing impact was low in coastal waters ( <= 0.3% of phytoplankton standing stock and <= 0.6% of primary productivity). In contrast, in the offshore waters, where salp blooms were observed, grazing impacts of up to 30% of standing stock and 169% of primary productivity were recorded. If S. thompsoni and L helicina continue to expand their ranges and increase in abundance, the associated shift in the food web dynamics of the WAP will alter the regional flow of carbon through the WAP food webs and the export of carbon to depth.

A variety of schemes have been used to partition the Southern Ocean, based variously on frontal positions, sea ice, productivity, water depth and nutrient concentrations. We have tested the utility and robustness of ecosystem bioregionalisation for the Scotia Sea, by classifying spring, summer and autumn stations on the basis of nutrient concentrations, phytoplankton taxa, meso- and macrozooplankton, fish catches and acoustic data. Despite sampling across different seasons and years, at different spatial scales and taxonomic resolutions, cluster analysis indicated basically consistent spatial divisions across this wide range of trophic levels. Stations could be classified into two main groups, lying broadly to the north and south of the Southern Antarctic Circumpolar Current Front (SACCF). In some aspects the 2 station groups were similar, with both having variable but often high phytoplankton biomass as well as similar biomass of fish. However, the colder water southern group, most of which was covered by seasonal sea ice, had a fundamentally different food web structure to that in the northern Scotia Sea. The cold water community had a depleted, cold-adapted fauna characterised by low zooplankton biomass, Euphausia superba and the fish Electrona antarctica and Gymnoscopelus braueri. In contrast the northern group was richer with higher mesozooplankton biomass and a fauna of warmer or more cosmopolitan species such as Thernisto gaudichaudii, Euphausia triacantha and the fish Protomyctophum bolini, Kreffticthys anderssoni and Gymnoscopelus fraseri. The position of the food web transition, broadly consistent with the position of the SACCF, supports a recent circumpolar-scale bioregionalisation. However, there is little evidence that this relatively weak frontal transition represents a significant barrier either here or elsewhere in the Southern Ocean. We suggest that broader-scale factors, namely temperature and possibly the extent of the seasonal ice-zone, within which most of the southern stations lay, were more likely to influence biological zonation.

Objectives were (1) to investigate the adult diet when they feed for themselves by analyzing stomach oil lipids, and (2) to compare the lipid signature of chick and adult oils. Stomach oils mainly consisted of triacylglycerols (TAG), diacylglycerol-ethers (DAGE) and wax esters (WE) (66, 14 and 11%, respectively). The dietary origin of TAG and WE was evaluated by linear discriminant analyses with fatty acid and fatty alcohol fractions. Analyses evidenced that stomach oils did not originate from Antarctic krill, but instead from myctophid fish, thus demonstrating the importance of mesopelagic fish in the nutrition of adult petrels. This result was consistent with the identification of digested remains of myctophids recovered from adult stomach contents after long foraging trips. Large amounts of a rare lipid class, DAGE (up to 76% of total lipids), were identified in two stomach oils, together with fresh remains of the squid Gonatus antarcticus (99% by mass), suggesting that DAGE could have the potential to be trophic markers of cephalopods. Moreover, six oils probably originated from Patagonian toothfish, thus confirming strong interactions between white-chinned petrels and fisheries. Comparison between chick and adult stomach oils indicated no major differences in their biochemical composition suggesting an identical dietary origin of oils, mainly myctophids. Both adult and chick oils can therefore be used to determine the feeding ecology of adult birds when they feed far away from their breeding grounds. Finally, food analysis of chick samples and adult samples collected after short and long trips indicated different foraging grounds during the two kinds of trips, and also between long trips performed in subtropical and Antarctic waters.

J	Berrow, SD; Croxall, JP				Berrow, SD; Croxall, JP			The diet of white-chinned petrels Procellaria aequinoctialis, Linnaeus 1758, in years of contrasting prey availability at South Georgia	ANTARCTIC SCIENCE												The diet of breeding white-chinned petrels was studied during the summers of 1996 and 1998 at South Georgia. Krill abundance/availability was high throughout 1996 but apparently low at the beginning of the 1998 breeding season. The diet of white-chinned petrels was similar between years and consistent with previous studies. Krill Euphausia superba (41-42% by weight) was the single most important prey item followed by fish (39-29%) and squid(19-25%). Meal mass was consistent(110 g in 1996, 119 g in 1998) between years but a significant decrease (46%) in feeding frequency in 1998 (0.54 meals day(-1) compared to 0.75 meals day(-1) in 1996) resulted in 19% less food delivered to chicks in 1998 than in 1996. Breeding success, however, was consistent between years at 44% and similar to that recorded previously at Bird Island. This is in contrast to black-browed and grey-headed albatrosses, both of which experienced almost total breeding failure in 1998. It is suggested that their varied and versatile feeding methods, together with their greater diving ability, capacity to feed at night and extensive foraging range, help white-chinned petrels minimise the effects of krill shortage.																	0954-1020	1365-2079				SEP	1999	11	3					283	292		10.1017/S0954102099000371							WOS:000086753000003

THE USE OF PATENT DATABASES TO PREDICT TRENDS IN THE KRILL FISHERY	CCAMLR SCIENCE												The fishery for Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) caught 210 000 tonnes in 2009/10 with vessels from six of CCAMLR's 25 Members participating in the fishery. Trends in the krill fishery are currently informed by data on annual catches and by CCAMLR's annual notification procedure. There has been considerable discussion within the Scientific Committee over the utility of these sources of information to detect trends in the fishery, and of the need to obtain more information from the krill industry so that developments that affect future catches can be predicted. This paper uses publicly available patent databases to examine both the number and type of patents related to krill that are lodged annually. This information shows similar trends to the catch and notification information, and the three sources of information can be used in combination to provide information to the Commission on potential changes in the krill fishery. The Scientific Committee has recommended that the patent database be maintained by the Secretariat so that it can annually update a register of krill-related patents which will be of use for indicating potential future trends in the krill fishery.

Numbers of grazers were experimentally manipulated in containers with natural phytoplankton assemblages. With natural levels of copepods but no krill a high (700 950 mug C . l-1, ca 30 mug chl a . l-1) phytoplankton biomass developed. In these cultures large diatoms, e.g. Corethron criophilum and chains of Thalassiosira sp., made up 80% of total phytoplankton cell carbon at the end of the experiment. In cultures with elevated numbers of copepods (5X or 10X the natural level) phytoplankton biomass was somewhat reduced (ca 23 mug chl a . l-1) compared to cultures with natural copepod abundance, but still high. Phytoplankton species composition was on the other hand greatly influenced. Instead of large diatoms these cultures were dominated by Phaeocystis pouchetii (70%) together with small Nitszchia sp. and Chaetoceros neogracile (20%). In containers with krill (both juveniles and adults), but without elevated numbers of copepods, phytoplankton biomass rapidly approached zero. With 10X the in situ level of copepods, krill first preyed on these before Corethron criophilum and Thalassiosira sp. were grazed. When krill were removed a plankton community dominated by flagellates (60-90%), e.g. Pyramimonas sp. and a Cryptophycean species, grazed by an unidentified droplet-shaped heterothrophic flagellate, developed. These flagellates were the same as those which dominated the plankton community in the Weddell Sea after the 'spring bloom'. A similar succession was observed in situ when a krill swarm grazed down a phytoplankton 'bloom' in a few hours. Our experiments show that copepods cannot control phytoplankton biomass in shipboard cultures even at artificially elevated numbers. Krill at concentrations similar to those in natural swarms have a great impact on both phytoplankton biomass and species composition in shipboard cultures. Both copepods and krill may have an impact on phytoplankton species composition and biomass in situ since the rates of phytoplankton cell division were probably artificially increased in ship-board cultures compared to natural conditions, where lower growth rates make phytoplankton more vulnerable to grazing. A similarity between phytoplankton successions in containers and in situ, especially with respect to krill grazing, supports the conclusion that grazing may structure phytoplankton communities in the Scotia-Weddell Sea.

The seasonal succession of zooplankton in the Southern Ocean south of Australia, part I: The seasonal ice zone	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART I-OCEANOGRAPHIC RESEARCH PAPERS												Between November 2001 and March 2002 an Australian/Japanese collaborative study completed six passes of a transect line in the Seasonal-Ice Zone (south of 62 degrees S) along 140 degrees E. Zooplankton samples were collected with a NORPAC net on 22-28 November, and a Continuous Plankton Recorder on 10-15 January, 11-12 February, 19-22 February, 25-26 February, and 10-11 March. Zooplankton densities were lowest on 22-28 November (ave = 61 individuals (ind) m(-3)), when almost the entire transect was covered by sea ice. By 10-15 January sea surface temperature had increased by similar to 2 degrees C across the transect line, and the study area was ice-free. Total zooplankton abundance had increased to maximum levels for the season (ave = 1301 ind m(-3); max = 1979 ind m(-3)), dominated by a "Peak Community" comprising Oithona similis, Ctenocalanus citer, Clausocalanus laticeps, foraminiferans, Limacina spp., appendicularians, Rhincalanus gigas and large calanoid copepodites (C1-3). Total densities declined on each subsequent transect, returning to an average of 169 ind m-3 on 10-11 March. The seasonal density decline was due to the decline in densities of "Peak Community" taxa, but coincided with the rise of Euphausia superba larvae into the surface waters, increased densities of Salpa thompsoni, and an increased contribution of C4 to adult stages to the populations of Calanoides acutus, Calanus propinquus and Calanus simillimus. The seasonal community succession appeared to be influenced by the low sea ice extent and southward projection of the ACC in this region. The relatively warm ACC waters, together with low krill biomass, favoured high densities of small grazers during the January/February bloom conditions. The persistence of relatively warm surface waters in March and the seasonal decrease in chlorophyll a biomass provided favorable conditions for salps, which were able to penetrate south of the Southern Boundary.

We hypothesized that the plant-and-krill-based diet would lead to a greater bioavailability of trace minerals and result in better broodfish condition, greater egg fertilization rates, increased survival of embryos to the swim-up stage, and increased egg mineral content. The three diets were fed to three replicate lots of 2-year-old, captive-reared fish for a 10-month period prior to spawning. None of the measured characteristics of broodfish condition differed significantly among diets. We found no significant differences among diets in rates of egg fertilization or survival of embryos to the swim-up stage. Manganese levels were lower in the eggs of fish fed one of the fish meal diets, but that was the only measure of egg content with a significant difference among diets. The experiment did not indicate that the plant-and-krill protein diet was better than fish-meal-based diets relative to the physiological condition of broodfish or the reproductive capabilities of Yellowstone cutthroat trout broodfish reared in captivity.																	1522-2055					JAN	2004	66	1					61	69		10.1577/A03-017							WOS:000188741600010

Assessing the recovery of an Antarctic predator from historical exploitation	ROYAL SOCIETY OPEN SCIENCE												The recovery of whale populations from centuries of exploitation will have important management and ecological implications due to greater exposure to anthropogenic activities and increasing prey consumption. Here, a Bayesian population model integrates catch data, estimates of abundance, and information on genetics and biology to assess the recovery of western South Atlantic (WSA) humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae). Modelling scenarios evaluated the sensitivity of model outputs resulting from the use of different data, different model assumptions and uncertainty in catch allocation and in accounting for whales killed but not landed. A long period of exploitation drove WSA humpback whales to the brink of extinction. They declined from nearly 27 000 (95% PI = 22 800-33 000) individuals in 1830 to only 450 (95% PI = 200-1400) whales in the mid-1950s. Protection led to a strong recovery and the current population is estimated to be at 93% (95% PI = 73-100%) of its pre-exploitation size. The recovery of WSA humpback whales may result in large removals of their primary prey, the Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba), and has the potential to modify the community structure in their feeding grounds. Continued monitoring is needed to understand how these whales will respond to modern threats and to climate-driven changes to their habitats.

Using a weak acid extraction method to dissolve organic material and leach associated but not constitutive trace elements of sediments, fifteen elements were measured from seafloor sediment, seawater particulates, and tissues of benthic (bivalves, brittlestars, sea urchins) and pelagic (demersal and pelagic fishes, krill) organisms collected in the flooded caldera. The highest element concentrations were associated with scafloor sediment, the lowest with seawater particulates and organism tissues. In the case of Ag and Se, concentrations were highest in organism tissue, indicating contamination through the food chain and biomagnification of those elements. The elements Al, Fe, Mn, Sr, Ti, and to a lesser extent Zn, were the most concentrated of the trace elements for all sample types. This indicates that the whole ecosystem of Deception Island is contaminated with trace elements from local geothermal activity, which is also reflected in the pattern of element contamination in organisms. Accordingly, element concentrations were higher in organisms collected at Deception Island compared to those from the neighboring non-active volcanic King George Island, suggesting that volcanic activity enhances bioavailability of trace elements to marine organisms.

SENSITIVITY INVESTIGATION OF THE SDWBA ANTARCTIC KRILL TARGET STRENGTH MODEL TO FATNESS, MATERIAL CONTRASTs AND ORIENTATION	CCAMLR SCIENCE												The distorted-wave Born approximation model is recognised as state-of-the-art in predicting acoustic target strength (TS) from fluid-like marine organisms. A stochastic version, the so-called SDWBA model, is endorsed by CCAMLR to predict the TS of Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) for use in the acoustic echo-integration method. In this study, the SDWBA TS pattern and frequency response behaviours at standard survey frequencies and animal lengths are explored via a sensitivity analysis of some important parameters: number of stochastic realisations, the fatness factor, the material contrasts between the organism and the surrounding seawater and the distribution of animal orientations. Due to the high variability of TS to realistic changes in parameters, it is important that the model should be parameterised according to the potential seasonal variability of krill in the area of investigation. In a multifrequency context, the girth-length relationship for the body shape parameterisation can give a high source of uncertainty, and there is an urgent need for development of accurate and standard procedures to measure both the material property contrasts and the orientation at the time and location of the actual survey. Moreover, a number of incongruities within the CCAMLR SDWBA model package are identified and proposed solutions implemented in an improved package.																	1023-4063						2011	18						97	122									WOS:000208703000007						
J	Pakhomov, EA; Perissinotto, R; McQuaid, CD				Pakhomov, EA; Perissinotto, R; McQuaid, CD			Prey composition and daily rations of myctophid fishes in the Southern Ocean	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												The feeding ecology of myctophids was studied using data collected during 5 South African scientific cruises to the Southern Ocean from 1985 to 1995. A total of 362 specimens, comprising 36 species, were analyzed for gut contents. Myctophid biomass levels, estimated from Bongo net tows, are among the lowest yet recorded for the Southern Ocean. Peak biomass levels were associated with the main frontal zones and with a permanent polynya region in the Lazarev Sea. Results show that all myctophid species are opportunistic mesozooplankton feeders exhibiting a high degree of overlap in their food spectrum and consuming primarily the most abundant species of copepods, euphausiids, hyperiids and pteropods. Daily rations were estimated using 3 different approaches and ranged from 0.2 to 4.4% of dry body weights. Generally, the daily food intake was equivalent to 0.5 (lower mean) to 2.9 (upper mean) of dry body weight for Antarctic and subantarctic species, and between 1.2 and 3.8% for temperate and subtropical species. Antarctic krill, Euphausia superba, was usually poorly represented in the stomachs of all but 1 myctophid species. The results of this study therefore do not support the hypothesis that krill plays a major role in the feeding ecology and budget of myctophids.

The objective of this study was to investigate whether commercial Antarctic krill meal Euphausia superba or hydrolysates enzymatically produced from Pacific hake Merluccius productus could reverse the negative palatability effects of SBM inclusion in juvenile chinook salmon diets. Diets without SBM or with SBM and no added feed attractant were used as positive and negative control diets respectively. Incorporation of 2% krill meal or Alcalase (R)-produced hydrolysates into SBM-containing diets (20% of dry matter by isonitrogenous replacement of fishmeal) significantly (P<0.05) increased feed intake, feed utilization, fish weight gain and thermal growth coefficient during a 5-week trial. Nevertheless, the negative effects on fish performance incurred by dietary inclusion of 20% SBM could not be fully reversed, indicating that most of those effects were likely unrelated to palatability. This study demonstrates the potential for using Pacific hake hydrolysates as a dietary feed attractant for salmonid diets, and supports the need for further research to optimize its application for ideal fish performance.

J	Ono, A; Moteki, M				Ono, Atsushi; Moteki, Masato			Spatial distributions of euphausiid species in the Northern Lutzow-Holm Bay, East Antarctica during the austral summer in 2005 and 2006	POLAR SCIENCE												Understanding the ecology of euphausiids, especially Euphausia superba, is essential for understanding the Southern Ocean ecosystem. To determine the distribution and community structure of euphausiids in north Lutzow-Holm Bay, we used stratified and quantitative sampling from the surface to a depth of 2000 m with an RMT 8 net in January of 2005 and 2006. Euphausiid abundance ranged from 1.2 to 32.2 ind. m(-2), with Thysanoessa macrura and E. superba being dominant, whereas E. triacantha and E. crystallorophias were very scarce. T. macrura was abundant in cold epipelagic waters as well as in the warmer Modified Circumpolar Deep Water (MCDW). E. crystallorophias was also observed in both the cold waters and the MCDW. The juveniles, adult males, and gravid and spent females (IIIC E) of E. superba were observed in the warm MCDW, which supports the possibility of deep water spawning, as suggested by previous studies. The E. superba population in 2005 was composed of large, mature individuals, whereas small, immature specimens were dominant in 2006. A higher chlorophyll a concentration in 2005, resulting from earlier sea ice retreat, may have advanced the maturity of E. superba. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. and NIPR.

J	Jones, CD; Ramm, DC				Jones, CD; Ramm, DC			The commercial harvest of krill in the southwest Atlantic before and during the CCAMLR 2000 Survey	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY												A brief history of the commercial harvest and fishing patterns for krill (Euphausia superba) in the Atlantic sector (Area 48) of the Southern Ocean is presented, with an emphasis on the commercial activities of the krill fishery at the time of the CCAMLR 2000 Survey. During the period of the CCAMLR 2000 Survey, commercial krill fishing activities were centered at the South Shetland Islands in the southern Scotia Sea (Subarea 48.1). Fishing patterns, catches, catch rates, and biological information are also presented for the Japanese stern trawler Chiyo maru No. 5, which conducted krill fishing operations in the CCAMLR Subarea 48.1 from 31 January to 1 March, 2000. Information on length and maturity composition is summarized for five regions adjacent to the South Shetland Islands where the Chiyo maru No. 5 fished. The biological information collected from the commercial fishery agrees well with the findings of the CCAMLR 2000 Survey, as well as with a regional acoustic survey conducted by the US AMLR in Subarea 48.1 from February 22 to March 7, 2000. The relationship between the commercial and survey information emphasizes the value of collecting fine-scale biological information from commercial krill fisheries in the Southern Ocean.

J	Kokubun, N; Kim, JH; Takahashi, A				Kokubun, Nobuo; Kim, Jeong-Hoon; Takahashi, Akinori			Proximity of krill and salps in an Antarctic coastal ecosystem: evidence from penguin-mounted cameras	POLAR BIOLOGY												Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) and salps (mainly Salpa thompsoni) are main components of Southern Ocean ecosystem, but little is known about their coastal distribution at a fine scale (< 1 km). We deployed miniaturised cameras on breeding chinstrap (n = 9 birds) and gentoo penguins (n = 9 birds) in the Antarctic Peninsula region and obtained 2,333 krill images, 93 salp images and 609 sea floor images from 1,843 dives. 51.2 % of penguin dives that had salps present in the images occurred near the dives with krill images (within 5 min). The vertical distribution of salp images showed overlap with the upper depth zone of krill images. While 16.3 % of dives with krill images were associated in time with the sea floor, only 1.2 % of dives with salp images did. These results revealed close proximity between krill and salps within the penguin's foraging range in an Antarctic coastal ecosystem. These results also imply that krill patches were common in both pelagic and benthic habitat, whereas salps were common mainly in pelagic habitat. If the effects of deployments are similar between the years or regions, inter-annual or regional comparison using the penguin-mounted camera will be valid for characterising prey environment in the penguin foraging area.																	0722-4060	1432-2056				DEC	2013	36	12					1857	1864		10.1007/s00300-013-1400-y							WOS:000327393700015

Modern krill stocks have been estimated directly by net hauls and acoustic surveys; the historical krill density especially the long-term one in the Southern Ocean, however, is unknown. Here we inferred the relative krill population changes along the West Antarctic Peninsula (WAP) over the 20th century from the trophic level change of Antarctic fur seal Arctocephalus gazella using stable carbon (delta C-13) and nitrogen (delta N-15) isotopes of archival seal hairs. Since Antarctic fur seals feed preferentially on krill, the variation of delta N-15 in seal hair indicates a change in the proportion of krill in the seal's diets and thus the krill availability in local seawater. For the past century, enriching fur seal delta N-15 values indicated decreasing krill availability. This is agreement with direct observation for the past similar to 30 years and suggests that the recently documented decline in krill populations began in the early parts of the 20th century. This novel method makes it possible to infer past krill population changes from ancient tissues of krill predators.

J	Saborowski, R				Saborowski, Reinhard			Related antipodes: a comparative study on digestive endopeptidases from Northern krill and Antarctic krill (Euphausiacea)	POLAR BIOLOGY												The Antarctic krill, Euphausia superba, and the Northern krill, Meganyctiphanes norvegica, are closely related species but occupy significantly different trophic and climatic environments. E. superba holds a key position as a phytoplankton grazer in the Southern Ocean. The omnivorous M. norvegica is an important member of plankton communities in the Northeast Atlantic. Both species expressed high proteolytic activities which were dominated by serine proteinases. In the stomachs of Antarctic krill, activities of total proteinase, trypsin, and chymotrypsin were significantly higher than in Northern krill. In the midgut glands, however, total proteinase and trypsin activities were similar in both species, but chymotrypsin activity was significantly higher in Antarctic krill. Moreover, Antarctic krill expressed four trypsin isoforms while only one isoform appeared in Northern krill. Chymotrypsin was present in either species as one single isoform. Antarctic krill adapted to the low and patchy distribution of food by elevated enzyme activities and the expression of trypsin isoforms with slightly different catalytic properties. Presumably, these enzymes facilitate in concerted action the efficient utilization of proteins from phytoplankton, the major food. Northern krill, in contrast, seems not to be equipped to face food limitation. It expresses a "simple" or "basic" set of digestive enzymes for utilizing abundant and easily digestible prey.

FORAGING-NICHE SEPARATION OF BREEDING GENTOO AND CHINSTRAP PENGUINS, SOUTH SHETLAND ISLANDS, ANTARCTICA	CONDOR												The realized niches of closely related species must differ if these species are to co-exist stably. The Gentoo (Pygoscelis papua) and Chinstrap Penguins (P. antarctica) breed concurrently in the Scotia Sea and Antarctic Peninsula regions. To identify species- and site-specific foraging niches, we compared the two species' foraging niches, including diet and foraging locations, at two sites in the South Shetland Islands with contrasting marine habitats. Both species fed primarily on Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba), though fish was also a component of the Gentoo Penguin's diet. Gentoo Penguins foraged closer to shore than did Chinstrap Penguins. Gentoo Penguins foraged during the day, while Chinstrap Penguins foraged throughout the diet cycle, sometimes traveling farther from shore on overnight foraging trips. In most cases, these species-specific foraging patterns were consistent with trends seen elsewhere in the region. However, within each species, site-specific differences in foraging niches were still evident. Overall, we observed that Gentoo Penguins traveled within consistent and limited distances from their colonies, but their diets varied by site in both meal mass and content. Chinstrap Penguins, in contrast, had a uniform diet of krill at both sites but varied the distance from shore and times at which they foraged.																	0010-5422					NOV	2010	112	4					683	695		10.1525/cond.2010.090221							WOS:000285727700007

Using geolocation to track the winter dispersion of the macaroni penguin	BIOLOGY LETTERS												Although penguins are key marine predators from the Southern Ocean, their migratory behaviour during the inter-nesting period remains widely unknown. Here, we report for the first time, to our knowledge, the winter foraging movements and feeding habits of a penguin species by using geolocation sensors fitted on penguins with a new attachment method. We focused on the macaroni penguin Eudyptes chrysolophus at Kerguelen, the single largest consumer of marine prey among all seabirds. Overall, macaroni penguins performed very long winter trips, remaining at sea during approximately six months within the limits of the Southern Ocean. They departed from Kerguelen in an eastward direction and distributed widely, over more than 3.10(6) km(2). The penguins spent most of their time in a previously unrecognized foraging area, i.e. a narrow latitudinal band (47-49 degrees S) within the central Indian Ocean (70-110 degrees E), corresponding oceanographically to the Polar Frontal Zone. There, their blood isotopic niche indicated that macaroni penguins preyed mainly upon crustaceans, but not on Antarctic krill Euphausia superba, which does not occur at these northern latitudes. Such winter information is a crucial step for a better integrative approach for the conservation of this species whose world population is known to be declining.

Wintertime overlaps between female Antarctic fur seals (Arctocephalus gazella) and the krill fishery at South Georgia, South Atlantic	PLOS ONE												The diet of Antarctic fur seals (Arctocephalus gazella) at South Georgia is dominated by Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba). During the breeding season, foraging trips by lactating female fur seals are constrained by their need to return to land to provision their pups. Post-breeding, seals disperse in order to feed and recover condition; estimates indicate c.70% of females remain near to South Georgia, whilst others head west towards the Patagonian Shelf or south to the ice-edge. The krill fishery at South Georgia operates only during the winter, providing the potential for fur seal: fishery interaction during these months. Here we use available winter (May to September) tracking data from Platform Terminal Transmitter (PTT) tags deployed on female fur seals at Bird Island, South Georgia. We develop habitat models describing their distribution during the winters of 1999 and 2003 with the aim of visualising and quantifying the degree of spatial overlap between female fur seals and krill harvesting in South Georgia waters. We show that spatial distribution of fur seals around South Georgia is extensive, and that the krill fishery overlaps with small, highly localised areas of available fur seal habitat. From these findings we discuss the implications for management, and future work.

Satellite imagery and historical data have identified the southern boundary of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current(1) as a site of enhanced biological productivity(2). Meso-scale surveys off the Antarctic peninsula have related the abundances of Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) and salps (Salpa thompsoni) to inter-annual variations in sea-ice extent(3). Here we have examined the ecosystem structure and oceanography spanning 3,500 km of the east Antarctic coastline, linking the scales of local surveys and global observations. Between 80 degrees and 150 degrees E there is a threefold variation in the extent of annual sea-ice cover, enabling us to examine the regional effects of sea ice and ocean circulation on biological productivity. Phytoplankton, primary productivity, Antarctic krill, whales and seabirds were concentrated where winter sea-ice extent is maximal, whereas salps were located where the sea-ice extent is minimal. We found enhanced biological activity south of the southern boundary of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current rather than in association with it(2). We propose that along this coastline ocean circulation determines both the sea-ice conditions and the level of biological productivity at all trophic levels.

High lift coefficients are essential for an otter board to maintain favorable fishing efficiency, especially for fishing target like Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) which is often found in layers very close to the sea surface. Response surface method (RSM) was used to optimize the parameters of a rectangular cambered otter board in this study. The aspect ratio (0.8-2.0), maximum relative camber (2%-18%), and maximum camber position (10%-50%) were adopted as the independent variables. Hydrodynamic performances of twenty otter board models were simulated using numerical simulation. Results showed that RSM was applicable to describe the relationship between the selected variables and the maximum lift coefficient. The maximum lift coefficient was significantly affected by these three variables. An optimal otter was extracted in the optimal solutions, and the optimal parameters of aspect ratio, maximum relative camber and maximum camber position were 2.0, 15.5% and 35.1%, respectively. Under the optimal conditions, the maximum lift coefficient was improved by 20.5% compared with the initial otter board. The relative error differed by only 1.6% from RSM model predictions, which indicated the availability of the model experimentally.																	0029-8018	1873-5258				JAN 15	2021	220								108475	10.1016/j.oceaneng.2020.108475							WOS:000607850200057

The composition of the diet was diverse, with both pelagic and benthic-demersal prey represented in the samples. Antarctic krill Euphausia superba was the most frequent and numerous prey at all the study sites except at Cierva Point, followed by fish, penguins and cephalopods. Antarctic krill also predominated by mass, followed by either fish or penguins. Fish were the second most important prey by mass at the Antarctic Peninsula whereas penguins were the second most important prey by mass at the South Shetland and South Orkney Islands. Among fish, Pleuragramma antarcticum was the most important species in the diet of the Antarctic fur seals at the Antarctic Peninsula whereas Gymnoscopelus nicholsi predominated at the South Shetland and South Orkney Islands. The results are compared with previous studies, and the possibility of implementing monitoring studies on the distribution/abundance of myctophids and P. antarcticum based on the analysis of the diet of the Antarctic fur seal is considered.																	0722-4060					DEC	2003	26	12					753	758		10.1007/s00300-003-0554-4							WOS:000186830700001

The measurements of total target strength (TTS; energy scattered in all directions, averaged over all angles of incidence) match the SDWBA model (stochastic distorted-wave Born approximation) recently developed for Antarctic krill, indicating its validity for other euphausiid species with similar size and shape. However, the TTS of crustaceans with markedly different shapes are not well predicted by SDWBA derived with the generic krill shape and scaled to animal length (L). Therefore, crustacean target strength (TS) may not be estimated accurately by a linear function of log(10)(L), irrespective of shape, questioning the validity of the current TS relationship used for Antarctic krill derived from data measured from multiple crustaceans. TTS and TS are dependent upon both L and shape, and different crustaceans have significantly different shapes and width-to-length relationships. In contrast, modelled TTS and TS spectra for gravid and non-gravid krill appear to have differing amplitudes, but similar shapes. Additionally, measurements of absorption spectra from decapods indicate that the absorption cross-section increases with the volume of the animal.

Dominant herbivorous macrozooplankton of this region, the Antarctic krill Euphausia superba and the tunicate Salpa thompsoni, were used in shipboard incubation experiments. The concentration of DMSPd + DMS increased in the water during incubation with krill. The production rate was 2.96 +/- 2.78 nmol DMSPd + DMS.krill(-1.)h(-1) (mean +/- SD). In addition, the DMSPd + DMS production rate was linearly related to the ingestion rate of krill (r(2) = 0.664, p less than or equal to 0.01). Addition of salps to natural surface water, however, did not change the DMSPd + DMS concentrations. During the experiments, both animals fed on phytoplankton cells. The fecal pellets of krill contained broken phytoplankton cells, whereas those of salps contained unbroken cells. These results suggest that sloppy feeding by krill is a more likely mechanism for producing DMS and DMSPd than the direct ingestion of phytoplankton cells by salps. The decrease of DMS concentrations in the upper 200 m of the water column from January to February may be explained, in part, by changes in the composition of the macrozooplankton community.

Spatial and temporal variability in the fish diet of Antarctic fur seal (Arctocephalus gazella) in the Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY-REVUE CANADIENNE DE ZOOLOGIE												The spatial and temporal variability in the fish component of the diet of Antarctic fur seals (Arctocephalus gazella (Peters, 1875)) in the Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean was examined using diet data from 10 sites in the region including a 13-year time series from South Georgia. The fish species composition in the diet at each site showed a strong relationship with the local marine habitat/topography. The absence of formerly harvested fish species indicates a lack of recovery of stocks of Notothenia rossii Richardson, 1844 at South Georgia and Champsocephalus gunnari Lonnberg, 1905 at the South Orkney Islands. At South Georgia, Protomyctophum choriodon Hulley, 1981, Lepidonotothen larseni (Lonnberg, 1905), and C. gunnari were the most important species in the diet between 1991 and 2004. Variability in the occurrence of C. gunnari was driven mainly by annual scale processes, particularly those that influence the availability of Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba (Dana, 1852)). The occurrence of the pelagic P. choriodon was primarily influenced by shorter-term water mass changes within the foraging range of the seals.

The aim of this study was to further our understanding of the distribution and phylogeny of krill species that were collected in the Ross Sea during the XIX PNRA expedition. Krill from 33 net samples were examined by sequencing parts of two mitochondrial genes; 530 bp of the gene 16S from a total of 20 specimens and 983 bp of NADH from 200 specimens. BIO-ENV analysis showed that the distribution of these species correlated best with water temperature than bottom depth and the ice presence. AMOVA analysis, conducted using the NADH data among geographic populations, revealed no significant differences of nucleotide diversity within the two Euphausia species: E. superba (n = 100, h = 0.97533 +/- 0.0472, p(i) = 0.53433 +/- 0.17212), E. crystallorophias (n = 100, h = 0.81762 +/- 0.07431, p(i) = 0.48578 +/- 0.46825). Most of the variability is associated with individuals and may depend on the high polymorphism of the species. AMOVA analysis between net samples showed no significant differences in all species.

Coastal regions of the northern Antarctic Peninsula are key for gentoo populations	BIOLOGY LETTERS												Southern Ocean ecosystems are rapidly changing due to climate variability. An apparent beneficiary of such change in the western Antarctic Peninsula (WAP) is the gentoo penguin Pygoscelis papua, which has increased its population size and expanded its range southward in the last 20 years. To better understand how this species has responded to large-scale changes, we tracked individuals during the non-breeding winter period from five colonies across the latitudinal range of breeding sites in the WAP, including from a recently established colony. Results highlight latitudinal gradients in movement; strong associations with shallow, coastal habitats along the entire Antarctic Peninsula; and movements that are independent of, yet constrained by, sea ice. It is clear that coastal habitats essential to gentoo penguins during the breeding season are similarly critical during winter. Larger movements of birds from northern colonies in the WAP further suggest that leap-frog migration may influence colonization events by facilitating nest-area prospecting and use of new haul-out sites. Our results support efforts to develop a marine protected area around the WAP. Winter habitats used by gentoo penguins outline high priority areas for improving the management of the spatio-temporally concentrated krill (Euphausia superba) fishery that operates in this region during winter.				, Jefferson/AAG-1702-2021	, Jefferson/0000-0002-3600-1414; Juares, Mariana A./0000-0002-6763-0416; Korczak-Abshire, Malgorzata/0000-0001-7695-0588												1744-9561	1744-957X				JAN 27	2021	17	1							20200708	10.1098/rsbl.2020.0708							WOS:000613728500001	33497589					
J	Staniland, IJ; Pond, D				Staniland, IJ; Pond, D			Variability in milk fatty acids: recreating a foraging trip to test dietary predictions in Antarctic fur seals	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY												Using Antarctic fur seals (Arctocephalus gazella (Peters, 1875)) in a feeding trial, we investigated the use of milk fatty acids to determine diet. In a regime designed to replicate an average foraging trip, six female seals were fed on four successive days meals of krill (Euphausia superba Dana, 1850; day 1), mixed krill and icefish (Champsocephalus gunnari Lonnberg, 1905; day 2), and icefish (days 3 and 4). Four milk samples were collected from each female, one every 12 h from the time of the last feed. Fatty acid profiles of samples were analysed using canonical discriminant analysis and classification trees. Milk fatty acids could be used to distinguish between seals fed the experimental diet, which was high in fish, and those feeding naturally, thought to be consuming mostly krill. However, there was significant variation between individual seals, which may have been the influence of feeding prior to the experiment. Milk fatty acids remained relatively unchanged over time, suggesting that the influence of dietary fatty acids was averaged over the suckling period. We conclude that, whilst this technique has potential in studying the diet of higher predators, further work is needed to test the underlying assumptions and mechanisms involved in the transfer of fatty acids from the diet into milk.

Physically stable and homogeneous microcapsuies were obtained with chitosan of different molecular weight. PUFAs were stable during the first 15 days of the study retaining over 95% of the eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid originally present in the oil. Astaxanthin and its ethers were not as stable as the PUFAs, however low.molecular weight chitosan showed a better protective effect than high molecular weight chitosan. The potential application of this micro-particulate system for PUFAs and liposoluble vitamin supplementation of processed human food and aquafeed is discussed. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Both the dominant Calanoida and Cyclopoida and the often neglected Harpacticoida, their abundances in relation to sea-ice formation and decline in presence of Euphausia superba are regarded, in this study. Alteutha potter sp. n. (Peltidiidae) was collected in Potter Cove, King George Island, Antarctica. While its geographical region occurrence and planktonic life style are comparable to many of its congeners, morphological characters such as shape and setation of the maxilliped and the almost complete fusion of the baseoendopod and the exopod of the fifth leg in the female are described for the first time for this genus. Morphological peculiarities such as the lack, the deformation or fusion of setae on only one body side have been detected in several specimens. This copepod species is obviously sea-ice related. Its abundances in the plankton reached a maximum under the winter sea-ice. The year round population structure did not show very high variability whereas ovigerous females mostly occurred in spring and summer. Assuming different possible ecological strategies and environmental temperatures generation times between 46 and 77 days are calculated for A. potter sp. n.

J	Ichii, T; Naganobu, M; Ogishima, T				Ichii, T; Naganobu, M; Ogishima, T			Competition between the krill fishery and penguins in the South Shetland Islands	POLAR BIOLOGY												Among the South Shetland Islands, the potential competition for krill (Euphausia superba) between the Japanese fishery and krill-eating breeding penguins was assessed. A low level of competition was apparent due to several factors. Spatial overlap between the main fishing and foraging areas was insignificant. Firstly, the large colonies of the dominant penguin (chinstrap penguins, Pygoscelis antarctica) occurred where sea ice disappears early in spring, and not necessarily where krill are abundant in summer, i.e, the area of krill fishery. Secondly, overlap between trawling depth and foraging dive depth of penguins was marginal, with the latter depth being shallower. Moreover, overlap in the size-frequency of krill caught by trawlers and those captured by penguins was not complete; the penguins took larger krill on average. Finally, the present small fishery is unlikely to impact upon local krill biomass in the region. Krill biomass was estimated to be 250-1500 x 10(3) tonnes within the preferred fishing areas during summer. The present catch rate by the fishery (less than or equal to 13 x 10(3) tonnes/half-month period) is smaller by an order of magnitude, and the fishing area does not include the main foraging areas of breeding penguins.																	0722-4060					JAN	1996	16	1					63	70		10.1007/BF01876830							WOS:A1996TG15500008						
J	Phleger, CF; Nichols, PD; Virtue, P				Phleger, CF; Nichols, PD; Virtue, P			Lipids and buoyancy in southern ocean pteropods	LIPIDS												The lipids of Clione limacina, a Southern Ocean pteropod (order Gymnosomata), contain 28% diacylglyceryl ether (DAGE) (as percentage of total lipid) whereas the pteropod Limacina helicina (order Thecosomata) lacks DAGE. The alkyl glyceryl ether diols (1-O-alkyl glycerols, GE) of Clione DAGE are dominated by 16:0 (60%) and 15:0 (21%), in contrast with deep-sea shark liver DAGE, which is dominated by 18:1 GE. The fatty acid profiles of Clione and Limacina are similar (28-32% polyunsaturated, 26-34% monounsaturated) as are the sterols, which include 24-methylenecholesterol, transdehydrocholesterol, cholesterol, and desmosterol. This finding probably reflects the fact that Limacina is the major food source for Clione. Spongiobranchaea australis, another Southern Ocean pteropod (order Gymnosomata), has 0.9-1.7% DAGE, but has less lipid (3.3-4.8 mg/g lipid, wet weight) than Clione (50.8 mg/g lipid, wet weight). We propose a buoyancy role for DAGE in Clione since Limacina has bubbles for flotation which Clione lack; DAGE provides 23% more uplift than triacylglycerol at a concentration of 1.025 g/mL seawater.

Winter and summer biogeography of macrozooplankton community structure in the northern Antarctic Peninsula ecosystem	PROGRESS IN OCEANOGRAPHY												Climate forcing is impacting polar marine ecosystems through increased variability of winter sea-ice dynamics, which likely influences the distribution, abundance and structure of zooplankton assemblages, and thereby trophodynamics of marine food webs. Due to the challenges of working in polar marine ecosystems, most knowledge on polar zooplankton community structure is derived from summer surveys. Here we examine the spatial distribution, abundance and community structure of macrozooplankton in relation to sea-ice and oceanclimate dynamics within the Antarctic Peninsula marine ecosystem over five consecutive winters. We compare the patterns revealed during winter with historical data collected in the same region during austral summer. Hydrographic and macrozooplankton data were collected from >100 standard stations off the northern Antarctic Peninsula during summer (2003-2011) and winter (2012-2016). Using multivariate methods, the environmental drivers and geographic structuring of the macrozooplankton community during winter and summer were investigated. Eight taxa made up 90% of total macrozooplankton abundance in winter including Metridia species, post-larval and larval Euphausia superba, post-larval Thysanoessa macrura, Limacina helicina, Chaetognatha, Ostracoda and Radiozoa. Eight slightly different taxa including Calanoides acutus, Salpa thompsoni, T. macrura (post-larvae and larvae), Metridia spp., E. superba larvae, Chaetognatha, and Rhincalanus spp. made up 87% of the total abundance in summer. Macrozooplankton clustered into five groups in winter and seven groups in summer. Winter macrozooplankton structure was more spatially consistent among years compared to summer regardless of sea-ice conditions. Salinity, chlorophyll a biomass, upper mixed layer depth and time of day were most strongly correlated with the multivariate ordination in winter whereas salinity, phaeopigment biomass and year had the highest correlations for summer, indicating the importance of similar physical features in both seasons. However, the importance of time scales differed among seasons. Although environmental determinants of summer and winter macrozooplankton community structure indicate that community structure and occurrence were strongly tied to regional variability of salinity and primary productivity gradients, macrozooplankton community structure is likely much more complex than only a few hydrographic variables can explain. Cluster boundaries are likely driven by dynamic locations of currents, fronts and localized eddies in any given season or year.																	0079-6611	1873-4472				AUG	2021	196								102610	10.1016/j.pocean.2021.102610							WOS:000677549200001

Ecosystem services of the Southern Ocean: trade-offs in decision-making	ANTARCTIC SCIENCE												Ecosystem services are the benefits that mankind obtains from natural ecosystems. Here we identify the key services provided by the Southern Ocean. These include provisioning of fishery products, nutrient cycling, climate regulation and the maintenance of biodiversity, with associated cultural and aesthetic benefits. Potential catch limits for Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba Dana) alone are equivalent to 11% of current global marine fisheries landings. We also examine the extent to which decision-making within the Antarctic Treaty System (ATS) considers trade-offs between ecosystem services, using the management of the Antarctic krill fishery as a case study. Management of this fishery considers a three-way trade-off between fisheries performance, the status of the krill stock and that of predator populations. However, there is a paucity of information on how well these components represent other ecosystem services that might be degraded as a result of fishing. There is also a lack of information on how beneficiaries value these ecosystem services. A formal ecosystem assessment would help to address these knowledge gaps. It could also help to harmonize decision-making across the ATS and promote global recognition of Southern Ocean ecosystem services by providing a standard inventory of the relevant ecosystem services and their value to beneficiaries.

J	Casaux, R; Barrera-Oro, E				Casaux, Ricardo; Barrera-Oro, Esteban			Dietary overlap in inshore notothenioid fish from the Danco Coast, western Antarctic Peninsula	POLAR RESEARCH												We carried out a dietary overlap analysis between notothenioid species by examining the stomach contents of more than 900 specimens collected in a fish assemblage at the Danco Coast, western Antarctic Peninsula, in the summer of 2000. Prey reoccurrences among fish species were 32.2%, with krill Euphausia superba, salps and the gammaridean Prostebeingia longicornis the most reoccurring prey. The diet similarity between species pairs was lower than 55%, in accordance with similar fish assemblages in the South Orkney Islands, the South Shetland Islands and the Antarctic Peninsula. Whereas at those localities the higher prey overlap was between krill-feeding fish species, at the Danco Coast it was between Trematomus bernacchii and Lepidonotothen nudifrons, Notothenia coriiceps and Notothenia rossii, Notothenia coriiceps and Parachaenichthyis charcoti, and Trematomus newnesi and Notothenia rossii, which shared primarily gammaridean amphipods, algae, fish and krill, respectively. Krill is normally the main prey of fish in summer in inshore waters of the western Antarctic Peninsula, but its density in January/February 2000 was notably lower than in previous years. Therefore, at the Danco Coast, under conditions of krill shortage, most of the notothenioid species foraged more intensively on alternative prey, such as gammarideans, fish and algae. The difference between areas in the pattern of dietary overlap might be related to differences in prey availability between years and to the degree of competition for targeted prey.																	0800-0395	1751-8369					2013	32								21319	10.3402/polar.v32i0.21319							WOS:000325892900001						
J	Boyd, IL				Boyd, IL			Estimating food consumption of marine predators: Antarctic fur seals and macaroni penguins	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY												1. Estimating food consumption is central to defining the ecological role of marine predators. This study developed an algorithm for synthesizing information about physiology, metabolism, growth, diet, life history and the activity budgets of marine predators to estimate population energy requirements and food consumption. 2. Two species of marine predators (Antarctic fur seal Arctocephalus gazella and macaroni penguin Eudyptes chrsolophus) that feed on krill in the Southern Ocean were used as examples to test the algorithm. A sensitivity analysis showed that estimates of prey consumed were most sensitive to uncertainty in some demographic variables, particularly the annual survival rate and total offspring production. Uncertainty in the measurement of metabolic rate led to a positive bias in the mean amount of food consumed. Uncertainty in most other variables had little influence on the estimated food consumed. 3. Assuming a diet mainly of krill Euphausia superba, annual food consumption by Antarctic fur seals and macaroni penguins at the island of South Georgia was 3.84 [coefficient of variation (CV) = 0.11] and 8.08 (CV = 0.23) million tonnes, respectively. This was equivalent to a total annual carbon consumption of 0.35 (CV 0.11) and 0.72 (CV = 0.23) G tonnes year(1). Carbon expired as CO2 was 0.26 (CV 0.06) and 0.65 (CV = 0.19) G tonnes year(1) for fur seals and macaroni penguins, respectively. The per capita food consumption varied depending upon sex and age but, overall, this was 1.7 (CV = 0.22) tonnes year(1) for Antarctic fur seals and 0.45 (CV = 0.22) tonnes year for macaroni penguins. 4. The algorithm showed that the seasonal demand for food peaked in both species in the second half of the breeding season and, for macaroni penguins, there was a second peak immediately after moult. Minimum food demand occurred in both species during the first half of the breeding season. 5. As both Antarctic fur seals and macaroni penguins compete for krill with a commercial fishery, these results provide an insight into the seasons and stages of the life cycle in which competition is likely to be greatest.																	0021-8901					FEB	2002	39	1					103	119		10.1046/j.1365-2664.2002.00697.x							WOS:000174307300010						
J	Donnelly, J; Kawall, H; Geiger, SP; Torres, JJ				Donnelly, J; Kawall, H; Geiger, SP; Torres, JJ			Metabolism of Antarctic micronektonic crustacea across a summer ice-edge bloom: respiration, composition, and enzymatic activity	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY												The Antarctic marginal ice zone is an important oceanic front separating the pack-ice and open-water environments. During summer, the retreating pack ice creates a meltwater lens in the euphotic zone, allowing primary producers and microheterotrophs to flourish in a discrete bloom just seaward of the retreating ice edge that lasts about 60 days. The purpose of the present study was to see if the ice-edge bloom had a discernible effect on the metabolism and physiological condition of Antarctic micronekton similar to that observed in zooplankton species. We also wished to assess the importance of the summer season to species' life cycles. Two major data sets were collected on 25 species in the following taxonomic groups: amphipods, cephalopods, decapods, euphausiids, isopods, mysids, ostracods, and polychaetes. The first data set described the metabolic rates of individuals in areas of the marginal ice zone with widely different levels of chlorophyll biomass to investigate the effect of the ice-edge bloom on metabolism. Additionally, summer metabolic rates were compared with data from other seasons. The second data set detailed the levels of protein, water, ash, RNA and DNA, and the activities of metabolic enzymes (citrate synthase and malate dehydrogenase) to examine the efficacy of biochemical indices as predictive tools for metabolism. Results suggested that the mobility of the micronektonic species eliminated most direct effects of the bloom on metabolism. Individuals captured in very different productivity regimes showed few significant differences in the metabolic indicators listed above. Isolated cases of changes in body composition and enzyme activity, however, implied that longer-term effects of the bloom may be exhibited. Seasonal increases in metabolism from winter to summer were observed in the euphausiids Euphausia superba, E. triacantha, and Thysanoessa macrura and the amphipod Vibilia stebbingi. It was concluded that the seasonal shifts were indicative of a "type 2" or compromise overwintering strategy whereby metabolism drops without an accompanying dormant state. Protein content and MDH activity were found to be the best predictors of respiration rate, while nucleic acid measures only correlated with respiration in immature specimens. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Cresswell, KA; Wiedenmann, JR; Mangel, M				Cresswell, Katherine A.; Wiedenmann, John R.; Mangel, Marc			A model of parental conflict: Predicting provisioning behavior of penguin partners in response to local changes in krill	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING												Understanding direct influences of local prey availability on penguin breeding behavior is limited in part because it is extremely challenging to organize a study that collects detailed data for both simultaneously. Models can help us understand the pattern of interaction between penguins and their prey, bridging holes in the data and helping steer future empirical studies. The main goal of our work is to provide an estimate of the functional response for penguins with respect to local changes in Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) around breeding colonies in the Southern Ocean. We use data from field studies on penguins and krill to characterize a state-dependent life-history model where a breeding pair of penguins forage to provision a chick to fledging. Each parent makes decisions that maximize a measure of reproductive success based on quantified estimates for state dynamics, using a probabilistic distribution of how their partner is behaving (determined by successive runs of the model). We predict that the relationships describing total amount of krill eaten and chick survival versus krill available around a breeding colony approximate a Holling Type III functional response. We also found that quantifying the quality of the prey environment, rather than total quantity was a useful and relatively simple way to test changes in krill availability. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

There is now extensive evidence that there are years when there is a very low abundance of Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) in the South Georgia area, and that this variation affects much of the ecosystem, with the most obvious impacts on survival and breeding success of some of the major predators on krill. The open nature of the South Georgia ecosystem means this variability has large-scale relevance, but even though there are unique time series of data available, information on some key processes is limited. Fluctuations in year-class success in parts, or all, of the krill population across the Scotia Sea can generate large changes in the available biomass. The ocean transport pathways maintain the large-scale ecosystem structure by moving krill over large distances to areas where they are available to predator colonies. This large-scale physical system shows strong spatial and temporal coherence in the patterns of the interannual and subdecadal variability. This physical variability affects both the population dynamics of krill and the transport pathways, emphasizing that both the causes and the consequences of events at South Georgia are part of much larger-scale processes.

J	Pusch, C; Hulley, PA; Kock, KH				Pusch, C; Hulley, PA; Kock, KH			Community structure and feeding ecology of mesopelagic fishes in the slope waters of King George Island (South Shetland Islands, Antarctica)	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART I-OCEANOGRAPHIC RESEARCH PAPERS												The role of mesopelagic fishes in the Southern Ocean ecosystem and more particular their trophic effect on the standing stock of mesozooplankton is at present poorly understood. To get a deeper insight in the Antarctic mid-water ecosystem the mesopelagic fish community of the King George Island slope (South Shetland Islands) was sampled with a pelagic trawl in 1996. The community structure was analysed and the feeding ecology was studied of the five most abundant species. A total of 18 mesopelagic fish species in 10 families was identified. Of these, the Nlyctophidae was the most important family by species number (9 species), individual number (98.5% of all individuals) and fish wet weight (87.3% of the total weight). The assemblage was numerically dominated by four myctophids (Electrona antarctica, Gymnoscopelus braueri, Gymnoscopelus nicholsi, Protomyctophum bolini) and one gempilyd (Paradiplospinus gracilis). Multivariate statistical analysis of the mesopelagic fish data reveals two major groups of stations according to the sampled depth: a shallow group of stations (295-450 m depth) and a deeper group of stations (440-825 m depth). The change in relative abundance of mesopelagic fish species at 440-450 m coincides with the presence of warmer and denser Circumpolar Deep Water at and below these depths. Deeper stations were characterized by a higher density and increased diversity of mesopelagic fish species. The community patterns identified correlated well with the vertical depth distribution of the most abundant species. Dietary analysis reveals that myctophids are mostly zooplanktivorous, while the gempilyd P. gracilis is classified as a piscivorous predator. The small P. bolini feed mainly on copepods of the species Metridia gerlachei, while the most important prey item of the larger myctophids E antarctica, G. braueri, and G. nicholsi were various species of euphausiids. Investigation of feeding chronology showed that G. nicholsi and P. bolini were feeding day and night. Daily ration estimates for myctophid species ranged from 0.28% to 3.3% of dry body weight (0.5-5.94% of wet body weight). Krill (Euphausia superba) were the most important food of E antarctica and G. nicholsi, accounting for 53.1% and 58.3% of the total food weight, respectively. The annual removal from the krill stock by both species was estimated to amount to 11.1-26.7% in the South Shetland Islands region. This estimate emphasizes the important role of mesopelagic fish in the Antarctic ecosystem as a prevalent consumer of krill. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

The average swimming angle was 30.4 degrees (s.d.=19.9 degrees), which was about 15 degrees less than that reported for Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba). Parameters for the swimming angle distribution were substituted into the straight cylinder model and the corresponding TS values were determined. The mean TS values of 16.4 mm isada krill for hovering animals were lower than the maximum TS; differences were 7.8-5.0 dB, 14.8-8.6 dB, and 18.1-10.8 dB at 50, 120, and 200 kHz, respectively. These differences will lead to a 1/6-1/3, 1/30-1/7, and 1/65-1/12 proportional difference, respectively, in estimating abundances compared to estimates based on the maximum TS. Measurements carried out al higher frequencies are more influenced by swimming angle than those at lower frequencies. However, the TS is less at lower Frequencies and it is more difficult to filter out noise. Thus, medium frequencies are suggested as the best for krill surveys. Additionally, when conducting resource surveys by echosounding, it is necessary to assign the appropriate swimming angles for different targets. Swimming angles need to be investigated further under a variety of conditions.

R.; Kawaguchi, So			Discovery of gregarine parasitism in some Southern Ocean krill (Euphausiacea) and the salp Salpa thompsoni	POLAR BIOLOGY												The presence and role of endoparasites in pelagic macrozooplankton within the Southern Ocean are poorly understood. Accounts of such parasites are generally restricted to the Antarctic krill species Euphausia superba, with little information on other possible host species. Endoparasitic gregarines were recorded for the first time in the euphausiids Euphausia triacantha and Euphausia valentini and the salp Salpa thompsoni during the Kerguelen Axis Antarctic research cruise (February-March 2016). Gregarines found in E. triacantha and E. valentini were morphologically similar to those previously identified in Antarctic krill, E. superba. Despite overlapping distributions, the smaller euphausiid Thysanoessa macrura possessed a different gregarine endoparasite, indicating parasite-host specificity in Southern Ocean euphausiids. Most notable was the discovery of large gregarines in the stomachs of aggregate individuals of S. thompsoni. The presence of gregarines in these dominant macrozooplankton indicates that endoparasitism within the Southern Ocean is more common than previously thought. Gregarines were observed in guts of krill and salps collected between 57.9 and 63.6A degrees S. The continual presence of gregarines in the species examined indicates that these host-parasite interactions are not isolated events with differing life stages of gregarines within the same intestinal tract of some species indicating periodic infection. The impacts of gregarine parasitism on these newly identified hosts are unclear and require further investigation to understand the spatial and temporal patterns of gregarine-host interactions.

There has been limited direct assessment of these interactions through deployment of cameras on commercial fishing gear especially on demersal longlines. A compact, autonomous deep-sea video system was designed and constructed by the Australian Antarctic Division (MD) for deployment on commercial fishing gear to observe interactions with benthos in the Southern Ocean finfish fisheries (targeting toothfish, Dissostichus spp). The Benthic Impacts Camera System (BICS) is capable of withstanding depths to 2500 m, has been successfully fitted to both longline and demersal trawl fishing gear, and is suitable for routine deployment by non-experts such as fisheries observers or crew. The system is entirely autonomous, robust, compact, easy to operate, and has minimal effect on the performance of the fishing gear it is attached to. To date, the system has successfully captured footage that demonstrates the interactions between demersal fishing gear and the benthos during routine commercial operations. It provides the first footage demonstrating the nature of the interaction between demersal longlines and benthic habitats in the Southern Ocean, as well as showing potential as a tool for rapidly assessing habitat types and presence of mobile biota such as krill (Euphausia superba).

Apparent digestibility of selected marine and terrestrial feed ingredients for tropical spiny lobster Panulirus ornatus	AQUACULTURE												This study reports the dry matter (DM), organic matter (OM), crude protein (CP), total lipid (TL) and gross energy (GE) apparent digestibilities of five marine animal and three terrestrial plant feed ingredients using sub-adult tropical spiny lobster (Panulirus ornatus) of 600-800 g. Apparent digestibility was determined using standard substitution procedures and employing ytterbium as the digestibility marker. Test ingredients were used at a substitution rate of 500 g kg(-1) or 300 g kg(-1) for animal or plant ingredients, respectively. In each of the two digestibility experiments (n = 5, the reference and four substituted diets were fed to lobsters fitted with a balloon fecal collection device. This enabled the collection of voided feces without contact with seawater and subsequent leaching losses. The derived DM, OM, CP, TL and E apparent digestibilities respectively were: 76, 81, 89, 64 and 83% for New Zealand mussel meal; 67, 79, 84, 77 and 81% for Peruvian fish meal; 69, 77, 89, 66 and 78% for spray-dried Antarctic krill meal; 53, 65, 85, 53 and 72% for Chilean langoustine meal; 47, 48, 59 41 and 58% for Japanese squid meal; 71, 66, 81, 41 and 72% for Australian solvent-extracted soybean meal; and 51, 57, 86, 33 and 63% for Australian dehulled lapin kernel meal (cv Wonga).

Investigating the utility of decapod crustacean eyestalks for age determination of two European spider crab species	FISHERIES RESEARCH												Until recently it was not thought possible to directly and accurately age crustacean species as any calcified structure that could preserve a record of chronological age is lost at moulting. Recent research has suggested that it may be possible to directly infer age from the number of endocuticular bands present within the eyestalks of snow crab (Chionoecetes opilio) and Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba). Using captive-reared Mediterranean spider crabs (Maja squinado), and wild-caught north-east Atlantic spider crabs (Maja brachydactyla), the present study aimed to determine if endocuticular bands of potentially annual periodicity are present within the eyestalks of these brachyurans. Although clear and readable bands were present within the endocuticle of their eyestalks, no bands of potentially annual periodicity were identified. The number of endocuticular bands did not correlate with the known-age of the M. squinado individuals; but did correlate positively with carapace length for both M. squinado and M. brachydactyla, suggesting they form as a result of growth and the size of individuals. It is hypothesised that these endocuticular bands, and potentially those identified by other studies purporting them to be annual growth bands, are in fact lamellae that appear due to the layers of calcite crystal aggregates interspersed with chitin and protein fibres that form the mineral of the cuticle in decapod crustaceans. Further research is needed to determine the processes that control and result in the deposition of crustacean cuticle, particularly during the post-moult period.

Bacterial community composition in Ad,lie (Pygoscelis adeliae) and Chinstrap (Pygoscelis antarctica) Penguin stomach contents from Signy Island, South Orkney Islands	POLAR BIOLOGY												Penguin stomach microbiota and its variability are important as these microbes may contribute to the fitness of the host birds and their chicks, and influence the microbial ecosystem of the surrounding soils. However, there is relatively little knowledge in this area, with the majority of studies focused on their deposited faeces. Here we investigated whether similar foraging strategies in adjacent colonies of different penguin species lead to similar temporarily conserved stomach microbiota. To do this, we studied the inter- and intra-specific variations in bacterial community composition in the stomach contents of sympatrically breeding Ad,lie (Pygoscelis adeliae) and Chinstrap (Pygoscelis antarctica) Penguins, which consumed a diet of 100% Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) under a similar foraging regime on Signy Island (maritime Antarctic), using a high-throughput DNA sequencing approach. Our data show that Ad,lie and Chinstrap Penguins shared 23-63% similarity in the stomach bacterial community composition, with no significant differences observed in the alpha-diversity or the assemblages of frequently encountered groups of operational taxonomic units (OTUs). The most frequently encountered OTUs that were shared between the species represented members of the phyla Fusobacteria, Firmicutes, Tenericutes and Proteobacteria. OTUs which were unique to individual birds and to single species formed approximately half of the communities identified, suggesting that stomach microbiota variability can occur in penguins that forage and breed under similar environmental conditions.

J	SINIFF, DB				SINIFF, DB			AN OVERVIEW OF THE ECOLOGY OF ANTARCTIC SEALS	AMERICAN ZOOLOGIST												Four species of seals occupy the pack-ice region of the oceans surrounding the Antarctic Continent. These seals include the crabeater (Lobodon carcinophagus), Leopard (Hydrurga leptonyx), weddell (Leptonychotes weddellii), and ross and are true seals with special adaptations for living in the pack-ice region. Two other seal species, the southern elephant seal (Mirounga leonina) and the fur seal (Arctocephalus gazella) (the only eared seal of this region) generally occur further to the north and use land rather than ice during the period of birth of young. This paper reviews the status of these species, and examines the general ecology of the four species that inhabit the pack-ice zone. In general, the four species that occupy the pack-ice zone have specialized in habitats and habits so that little overlap in diets or habitat use exist among these species. The exception is the interaction between the leopard and the crabeater which occupy the same regions and eat krill (Euphausia superba), particularly during the winter. The impact of the potential harvest of krill by man on these species is discussed. Further, the impact that recovery of the large baleen whales that feed in this region during the summer is discussed with regard to the changes that might occur as competition for krill by the large vertebrate species increases.																	0003-1569						1991	31	1					143	149									WOS:A1991FD12300011						
J	Fauchald, P				Fauchald, Per			Spatial interaction between seabirds and prey: review and synthesis	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												The Ideal Free Distribution theory predicts a close spatial match between predators and prey. Studies have shown that seabird and prey distribution seldom conforms with this prediction. In this study, I review recent theoretical advances in spatial predator-prey interactions and relate these with studies of seabirds and pelagic schooling fish and crustaceans. Studies on seabirds and prey have generally assumed that prey are nonresponsive. Predator-prey interactions should, however, be viewed as a 2-way spatial game where seabirds track concentrations of prey while prey move away from areas with high risk of predation. The outcome of the game depends on how seabirds and prey are spatially constrained. Constraints include the spatial distribution of resources, interspecific competition, the location of spawning and breeding areas, and limitations on diving depth. Although game theoretic models can explain some general aspects of the spatial interaction, the spatial distribution of seabirds and prey is generally much more aggregated and elusive than can be expected from the game theoretic equilibrium. This is because spatial pattern is formed through self-organizing behavior that includes schooling, local enhancement and area-restricted search (ARS). Schooling and local enhancement are processes with strong positive density dependence that destabilize the predator-prey interaction locally. However, the unstable local dynamics might be stabilized by spatial constraints and the effects of ARS processes at large scales.

Seasonal variation in the predatory impact of myctophids on zooplankton in the Scotia Sea (Southern Ocean)	PROGRESS IN OCEANOGRAPHY												Myctophids are the biomass-dominant mesopelagic fishes in the Southern Ocean, but their trophic role within the pelagic food web south of the Antarctic Polar Front is poorly resolved from a seasonal perspective at the ocean-basin scale. In this study, the predatory impact of the predominant Southern Ocean myctophid community (Electrona antarctica, Electrona carlsbergi, Gymnoscopelus braueri, Gymnoscopelus fraseri, Gymnoscopelus nicholsi, Protomyctophum bolini, Protomyctophum tenisoni, Protomyctophum choriodon, Krefftichthys anderssoni and Nannobrachium achirus) on their zooplankton prey was examined during austral spring, summer and autumn in the Scotia Sea, one of the most productive regions of the Southern Ocean. Seasonal variations in diet and predation rates were apparent for all species. Based on the percentage index of relative importance, myctophids had high overlap in their diets, with all species mostly consuming copepods, small euphausiids and amphipods. Myctophid size was a key determinant of diet in the region, with larger species and intra-specific size classes consuming larger prey. Cluster analyses revealed myctophid feeding guilds that appeared to change seasonally, although there was little evidence of dietary specialisation. Myctophid predation on the daily productivity of most copepod species was relatively low across seasons (< 7%), except for Calanus simillimus that was predated upon highly in summer (similar to 26%). From the macrozooplankton component of the prey field, the myctophid community consumed substantial proportions of the euphausiid Thysanoessa spp. in each season (similar to 7 to 76% daily productivity), particularly in summer. Relatively high proportions of the daily Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) productivity (similar to 8-58%) were also consumed by the larger myctophid species, particularly in summer by Electrona antarctica, suggesting increased competition for krill resources during the higher predator breeding season and possible reductions in food web stability during periods of reduced krill availability at this time. The amphipod Themisto gaudichaudii formed an important part of the larger myctophid species' diet in all seasons, with between 10 and 38% of its daily productivity being consumed. Myctophid predation on the daily productivity of salps was up to 4%, whilst their impact on ostracods and pteropods was negligible (< 0.1% of daily productivity) in all seasons. This study demonstrates that Southern Ocean myctophids link secondary productivity to higher predators through both krill-independent and krill-dependent trophic pathways across seasons, with myctophids comprising a more krill-dependent pathway during austral summer.				, Martin/ABE-6728-2020; Simeon, Hill L/B-2307-2008; Collins, Martin A/J-8560-2017	Stowasser, Gabriele/0000-0002-0595-0772; Tarling, Geraint/0000-0002-3753-5899												0079-6611					NOV	2018	168						123	144		10.1016/j.pocean.2018.09.017							WOS:000452943300011

Both are essential components of the Southern Ocean ecosystem, but occupy distinct environmental geographical locations with slightly different temperature regimes. They therefore provide a useful model system for the investigation of adaptations to thermal tolerance. Methodology/Principal Finding Initial CTmax studies showed that E. superba was slightly more thermotolerant than E. crystallorophias. Five Hsp70 mRNAs were characterized from the RNAseq data of both species and subsequent expression kinetics studies revealed notable differences in induction of each of the 5 orthologues between the two species, with E. crystallorophias reacting more rapidly than E. superba. Furthermore, analyses conducted to estimate the evolutionary rates and selection strengths acting on each gene tended to support the hypothesis that diversifying selection has contributed to the diversification of this gene family, and led to the selective relaxation on the inducible C form with its possible loss of function in the two krill species. Conclusions The sensitivity of the epipelagic species E. crystallorophias to temperature variations and/or its adaptation to cold is enhanced when compared with its sister species, E. superba. These results indicate that ice krill could be the first of the two species to be impacted by the warming of coastal waters of the Austral ocean in the coming years due to climate change.				corre, erwan/O-4669-2019; Clark, Melody S/D-7371-2014	corre, erwan/0000-0001-6354-2278; Clark, Melody S/0000-0002-3442-3824; Papot, Claire/0000-0002-8324-2261												1932-6203					APR 2	2015	10	4							e0121642	10.1371/journal.pone.0121642							WOS:000352139000053	25835552					
J	Croxall, JP; Prince, PA; Reid, K				Croxall, JP; Prince, PA; Reid, K			Dietary segregation of krill-eating south Georgia seabirds	JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY												The diets of six of the main seabird species (two petrels, two albatrosses, two penguins) breeding at Bird Island, South Georgia were studied simultaneously during the chick-rearing period in 1986. For five species, Antarctic krill Euphausia superba was the main food (39-98% by mass); grey-headed albatrosses took mainly the ommastrephid squid Martialia hyadesi (71%) and only 16% krill. The size of the krill taken was similar between seabird species, although there were small but significant differences between penguins and the other species. Sex and reproductive status of krill, however, was different between all seabird species, reflecting some combination of differences in foraging ranges, selectivity by predators, or differences in escape responses of krill. For the krill-eating species, the rest of the diet varied substantially between species, comprising Martialia and nototheniid fish (black browed albatross and, along with lanternfish, white-chinned petrel), lanternfish and amphipods (Antarctic prion and macaroni penguin), and icefish (gentoo penguin). Long-term data on breeding success and information on diet in 5-10 other years suggest that in 1986 seabird diet and reproductive performance was indicative of a year of good availability of krill around South Georgia. In such circumstances, ecological segregation between krill-eating species appears to be maintained chiefly by differences in foraging range and feeding methods, which are reviewed. This situation is rather different from the few studies of seabird communities elsewhere, where prey type and size are believed to be the main mechanisms of dietary segregation.

ANTARCTIC RADIOCARBON RESERVOIR: THE CASE OF THE MUMMIFIED CRABEATER SEALS (LOBODON CARCINOPHAGA) IN BODMAN CAPE, SEYMOUR ISLAND, ANTARCTICA	RADIOCARBON												At least 50% of the world's seal population is distributed in the pack-ice region surrounding Antarctica. Among the Antarctic seals, Lobodon carcinophaga (commonly known as "crabeater seals") are the most abundant. This is a krill-feeding species, subsisting primarily on Euphausia superba. The occurrence of mummified seals has been documented since 1900 in several Antarctic regions, and different hypotheses about age and what happened to them have been proposed. Taking into account the depletion of C-14 concentration in marine waters, we dated a recently deceased and a mummified L. carcinophaga along with a mollusk (Nacella concinna) collected alive from different locations around Antarctica. We discuss their relationship in light of the C-14 reservoir. The age obtained for the recently deceased crabeater seals suggests a reservoir age of around 1300 yr for these waters, which is in agreement with the correction value for reservoir age obtained for the same species in the area. We applied this reservoir correction value to the conventional age of 1180 C-14 yr BP obtained for the mummified seal. The results indicate that the death event probably occurred within the last 100 yr. The age obtained for the mollusk specimen confirms that the correction values of the reservoir effect for the Antarctic continent vary according to geographical location and to the type of sample dated.																	0033-8222	1945-5755					2011	53	1					161	166		10.1017/S0033822200034433							WOS:000288745800013

Five hauls were conducted north of the two islands at depths of 149 to 282 m on 21 February 2002. Published and unpublished reports from fishing operations in the 1970s and 1980s by the Fischkombinat in Rostock (former GDR), Sea Fisheries Institute in Gdynia (Poland) and material available from YugNIRO, Kerch (Ukraine) of what is known of fishing activities in the area were analysed. These data were previously unavailable to CCAMLR. Fishing and the extent of fishing was primarily dependant on whether and to what extent the target species of the fishery, the spiny icefish (Chaenodraco wilsoni), formed concentrations. Information on these fishing operations was, however, sparse, being restricted to the two seasons (1978/79 and 1979/80) when Polish and GDR vessels fished in the area. Length compositions from several fishing nations revealed that the fishery targeted primarily fish 25-35 cm long. The fish fauna at the tip of the Antarctic Peninsula represents a combination of low- and high-Antarctic elements. The available information on the biology of C. wilsoni was reviewed. Some new information was available on the reproduction and feeding of some of the species. Krill (Euphausia superba) formed a major element in the diet of icefish.																	1023-4063						2004	11						1	20									WOS:000225324900001

Included in the VE composition was a newly described 'marine-derived' tocopherol (MDT), an unsaturated-isoprenoid derivative of alpha-tocopherol, that is attributed to enhancing antioxidant protection of cellular lipids at low temperature. MDT was found to co-exist with alpha-tocopherol in all Antarctic samples, ranging from 2.8 to 22.3% of the total VE composition. The highest level of VE was found in the liver of G. gibberifrons (VE=416.7 pmol/mg wet tissue) although this tissue had a low MDT composition (7.7%), whereas the greatest MDT composition was measured in the liver of C. gunnari (MDT=22.3%). In notothenioids, the pectoral adductor muscle, which has a high density of mitochondria, contained higher levels of VE than white myotomal muscle, but differences in MDT composition were small. Phytoplankton and krill also contained MDT, which supports the contention that MDT is obtained directly from the primary food chain. Our finding of MDT in Antarctic organisms is consistent with its putatively adaptive function to enhance antioxidant protection in coldwater metabolism. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

Gut pigment levels varied from 1.7 to 40.6 ng chlorophyll a (Chl a) equiv..individual(-1) in adults and from 0.3 to 9.3 ng Chl a equiv..individual(-1) in juveniles. Highest levels were observed at the Subtropical Convergence (Chl a concentrations 0.4-0.6 mug.L-1) and minima in the area north of the Agulhas Front (Chl a concentrations 0.2-0.3 mug.L-1). Gut evacuation rates ranged between 0.59 and 0.96.h(-1). Gut pigment destruction levels were among the highest ever recorded in euphausiids, with 94.2-98.5% of total pigments ingested converted to nonfluorescing end products. Size-selectivity experiments with natural phytoplankton showed that E. spinifera ingests mainly cells in the 0.7- to 20-mum range. The grazing dynamics of this important species are compared with those of subantarctic (Euphausia vallentini) and Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba). Individual ingestion rates, estimated from the autotrophic component of its diet (2.78-4.46 mug Chl a equiv..individual(-1).day(-1)), were just sufficient to account for respiratory requirements. While E. spinifera is clearly able to ingest large amounts of heterotrophic prey, it is not known to what extent these contribute to its total energy budget.																	0706-652X	1205-7533				FEB	2001	58	2					273	281		10.1139/cjfas-58-2-273							WOS:000166837700005

Population dynamics and production of Themisto gaudichaudii (Amphipoda, Hyperiidae) at South Georgia, Antarctica	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY												The population dynamics, individual growth rates and productivity of the hyperiid amphipod Themisto gaudichaudii were studied in Cumberland Bay, a fjord on the north-eastern coast of South Georgia. The study involved the weekly sampling of the population and its potential food with a Rectangular Midwater Trawl (RMT1) at weekly intervals between May 2005 and October 2006. Offshore samples were taken the previous austral summer using an RMT8 net. T. gaudichaudii produced one main cohort in the spring (September/October) and a secondary weaker cohort in the late summer (January/February). The main cohort appeared at the time of phytoplankton increase, about 3 weeks before an increase in mesozooplankton. Larger individuals (20-25 mm) resided offshore but not within the Bay during the main recruitment period. T. gaudichaudii grew at an average rate of 0.1 mm d(-1) during the first four months after release and then by 0.07 mm d(-1) for the subsequent four months. At these rates, it is possible that the main cohort reaches reproductive size in time to spawn the autumn cohort, although the relative weakness of the autumn cohort suggests that few manage this. T. gaudichaudii biomass reached its highest levels in November at a mean value of 5.4 mg DW m(-3) while daily production was also highest in November at a mean value of 0.17 mg DW m(-3) d(-1). The P/B d(-1) ratio varied between 0.03 d(-1) in the summer to below 0.01 d(-1) in the winter. Daily mortality rate was initially 0.12 d(-1) during the first two months post-recruitment, falling to 0.03 d(-1) for the remainder of the year. Integrating production over the year gave a value of 10.04 mg DW y(-1), equivalent to 3.62 mg C m(-3) y(-1), making T. gaudichaudii a relatively productive component of the pelagic community. During the summer, the species was estimated to consume around 1-2% of available mesozooplankton biomass and a mean of 15% of mesozooplankton daily productivity. T. gaudichaudii may have a controlling influence on mesozooplankton dynamics as well as on the recruitment of the larval stages of important commercially fished species such as Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) and Mackerel icefish (Champsocephalus gunnari).

AN OVERVIEW OF SOUTHERN OCEAN ZOOPLANKTON DATA: ABUNDANCE, BIOMASS, FEEDING AND FUNCTIONAL RELATIONSHIPS	CCAMLR SCIENCE												There is an enormous amount of data on Southern Ocean (SO) zooplankton, mostly on their distribution with a minority addressing rate processes. This review aims to summarise these data and show where it resides, to assist SO food-web modellers or those with limited specialist knowledge of SO zooplankton. First, a brief overview is provided of the diversity and basic biology of SO zooplankton, with an emphasis on abundance, distribution and feeding. Second, advice is provided on the uses, strengths and limitations of zooplankton data as inputs to SO data compilations or food-web models. Copepods overall comprise >75% of the SO zooplankton biomass (excluding Euphausia superba). Total mesozooplankton biomass density differs little between the Antarctic sectors, but latitudinally it is maximal in the Polar Frontal Zone and declines to the north and south. Those compiling data on numerical density (no. m(-2) or no. m(-3)) need to allow for differences in the extent of identification of early larval stages. Likewise, the time of year, depth of sampling and mesh size of sampler greatly influence the recorded abundance, since the populations can make seasonal vertical migrations and their pulsed reproduction causes great seasonal changes in size structure and abundance. Other issues are specific to polar environments, for example, lipid storage which leads to significantly different length-mass and mass-rate relationships than are reported in global literature compilations. Likewise, stenothermy (narrow temperature tolerance) means that fixed (Q(10)-type) temperature relationships based on global literature compilations must be applied with great caution in SO-specific studies. Protozoa/micrometazoa (<200 mu m) are the main grazers in the SO, since mesozooplankton typically remove <30% of primary production. This emphasises the dominant role of microbial food chains involving small metazoans, relative to the classic short diatom-krill-whale type food chains. Even within regions of abundant krill, copepod production in summer roughly triples that of postlarval E. superba. This fact reflects a large flow of energy through multiple trophic levels, via copepods and their major invertebrate predators such as other predatory copepods, chaetognaths, small omnivorous euphausiids, amphipods up to myctophid fish and birds.																	1023-4063						2012	19						171	218									WOS:000318781400007

SealNet: A fully-automated pack-ice seal detection pipeline for sub-meter satellite imagery	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Antarctic pack-ice seals, a group of four species of true seals (Phocidae), play a pivotal role in the Southern Ocean foodweb as wide-ranging predators of Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba). Due to their circumpolar distribution and the remoteness and vastness of their habitat, little is known about their population sizes. Estimating pack-ice seal population sizes and trends is key to understanding how the Southern Ocean ecosystem will react to threats such as climate change driven sea ice loss and krill fishing. We present a functional pack-ice seal detection pipeline using Worldview-3 imagery and a Convolutional Neural Network that counts and locates seal centroids. We propose a new CNN architecture that detects objects by combining semantic segmentation heatmaps with binary classification and counting by regression. Our pipeline locates over 30% of seals, when compared to consensus counts from human experts, and reduces the time required for seal detection by 95% (assuming just a single GPU). While larger training sets and continued algorithm development will no doubt improve classification accuracy, our pipeline, which can be easily adapted for other large-bodied animals visible in sub-meter satellite imagery, demonstrates the potential for machine learning to vastly expand our capacity for regular pack-ice seal surveys and, in doing so, will contribute to ongoing international efforts to monitor pack-ice seals.

Drivers of intrapopulation variation in resource use in a generalist predator, the macaroni penguin	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												Intrapopulation variation in resource use occurs in many populations of generalist predators with important community and evolutionary implications. One of the hypothesised mechanisms for such widespread variation is ecological opportunity, i.e. resource availability determined by intrinsic constraints and extrinsic conditions. In this study, we combined tracking data and stable isotope analysis to examine how breeding constraints and prey conditions influenced intrapopulation variation in resource use in a generalist predator, the macaroni penguin Eudyptes chrysolophus. Isotopic variation was also examined as a function of breeding success, individual traits and individual specialisation. Variation in isotope ratios was greatest across multiple tissue types when birds were able to undertake mid-range foraging trips (i.e. during incubation and pre-moult). This variation was highly consistent between years that spanned a 3-fold difference in local prey Euphausia superba density, and was also highly consistent at the individual level between 2 years that had similar prey densities. Furthermore, by comparing our results with previous work on the same population, it appeared that a decrease in local prey availability can also increase intrapopulation variation in resource use during periods with more restricted foraging ranges (i.e. during brood-guard and creche). This study highlights the importance of considering ecological interactions that operate on multiple spatio-temporal scales when examining the drivers of resource use in populations of generalist predators.

The arsenic species studied include arsenobetaine (AsB), arsenite (As(III)), dimethylarsinic acid (DMA), monomethylarsonic acid (MMA), and arsenate (As(V)), which were extracted from samples using 2% formic acid. Gradient elution using 33 mmol L-1 CH3COONH4 and 15 mmol L-1 Na2CO3 with 10 mL CH3CH2OH at pH 8.4 allowed the chromatographic separation of all the species on a Hamilton PRP-X100 anion-exchange column in less than 8 min. In this study, an ultrasound extraction method was used to extract arsenic species from seafood. The extraction efficiency was good and the recoveries from spiked samples were in the range of 72.6%-109%; the precision between sample replicates was higher than 3.6% for all determinations. The detection limits were 3.543 mu g L-1 for AsB, 0.426 mu g L-1 for As(III), 0.216 mu g L-1 for DMA, 0.211 mu g L-1 for MMA, and 0.709 mu g L-1 for As(V), and the linear coefficients were greater than 0.999. We also developed an application of this method for the determination of arsenic species in bonito, Euphausia superba, and Enteromorpha with satisfactory results. Therefore, it was confirmed that this method was appropriate for the detection of arsenic species in seafood.																	1672-5182	1993-5021				MAY	2017	16	3					455	460		10.1007/s11802-017-3070-9							WOS:000400939300010

Geographical variation in the behaviour of a central place forager: Antarctic fur seals foraging in contrasting environments	MARINE BIOLOGY												Foragers show adaptive responses to changes within their environment, and such behavioural plasticity can be a significant driving force in speciation. We investigated how lactating Antarctic fur seals, Arctocephalus gazella, adapt their foraging within two contrasting ecosystems. Location and diving data were collected concurrently, between December 2003 and February 2004, from 43 seals at Bird Island, where krill, Euphausia superba, are the main prey, and 39 at Heard Island, where mostly fish are consumed. Seals at Heard Island were shorter and lighter than those at Bird Island and they spent longer at sea, dived more frequently and spent more time in the bottom phase of dives. Generalized additive mixed effects models showed that diving behaviours differed between the islands. Both populations exploited diel vertically migrating prey species but, on average, Heard Island seals dived deeper and exceeded their estimated aerobic dive limits. We propose that the recovery of the Heard Island population may be limited by the relative inaccessibility and scarcity of food, whereas at Bird Island, the presence of abundant krill resources helps sustain extremely high numbers of seals, even with increased intra- and inter-specific competition. Both populations of fur seals appear to be constrained by their physiological limits, in terms of their optimal diving behaviour. However, there does appear to be some flexibility in strategy at the level of trip with animals adjusting their time at sea and foraging effort, in order to maximize the rate of delivery of energy to their pups.

Instead, there is now increasing recognition that alternative energy pathways through mid-trophic level groups (mesopelagic fish and squid) may be equally (if not more) important than the krill pathway in many regions. Ecosystem models are a valuable tool to synthesise existing data on the structure of marine food webs and to visualise and quantify alternative energy pathways. In this study we develop a static mass balance food web model for the southern Kerguelen Axis region (Prydz Bay and Princess Elizabeth Trough) to evaluate the importance of alternative energy pathways through mid-trophic level groups, including fish, squid and krill, in maintaining energy flow to top predators within East Antarctica. Our model reveals several major trophic pathways distinct from, and equally important to the Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) pathway. Using simple scenarios of reductions in krill biomass, we investigate how the system might switch to a state dominated by fish and squid pathways with the response of krill-reliant predators strongly dependent on their ability to switch to other prey sources. We conclude by discussing what these findings might suggest for the future vulnerability of East Antarctic food webs and the implications for future modelling work in the region.

In discussing the data, the prey-predator linkage between these species was taken into account. Sampling was carried out during the 1995/96 and 1999/00 Italian Antarctic Expeditions. Fifty four polychlorobiphenyls (PCBs) and p,p'-DDE and hexachlorobenzene (HCB) were quantified in stomach contents of penguins nesting at Edmonson Point (Victoria Land) and in whole specimens of silverfish and krill from the Ross Sea. Xenobiotic concentrations in organisms were low compared to data reported for many marine species of lower latitudes and ranged from 0.22 ng g(-1) wet wt p,p'-DDE in krill to 161 ng g(-1) wet wt PCBs in silverfish. Fingerprints and class of isomer patterns showed a predominance of low chlorinated PCBs, mainly in pelagic organisms. Average input of these POPs through the diet was also evaluated. Concentrations of the most toxic non-ortho PCBs, IUPAC nos 77 (3,3',4,4'), 126 (3,3',4,4',5) and 169 (3,3',4,4',5,5'), were 1.63 pg g(-1), 7.31 pg g(-1) and 0.23 pg g(-1) wet wt, respectively, in stomach content samples. Stomach contents had 0.037 pg g(-1) wet wt TEQ (Toxic Equivalents) of which penta-CB 126 accounted for most of the toxicity.				ademollo, nicoletta/AAY-4811-2020; Olmastroni, Silvia/G-6267-2018; Corsolini, Simonetta/B-9460-2012; Romeo, Teresa/AAA-1711-2020	Olmastroni, Silvia/0000-0002-9319-9914; Corsolini, Simonetta/0000-0002-9772-2362; Ademollo, nicoletta/0000-0002-1875-6530; Romeo, Teresa/0000-0001-8515-1964												0954-1020	1365-2079				JAN	2003	15	1					95	104		10.1017/S0954102003001093							WOS:000181701700012

In this study, the effects of processing methods on the content, structural isomers, and composition of astaxanthins (free astaxanthin and astaxanthin esters) were studied. Three drying methods, comprising freeze-drying, microwave drying, and hot-air drying, were used. Free astaxanthin (Ast), astaxanthin monoesters (AM), and astaxanthin diesters (AD) in boiled krill (control) and dried krill were extracted and analyzed using high-resolution mass spectrometry with ultraviolet detection. After the three processes, total astaxanthin loss ranged from 8.6 to 64.9%, and the AM and AD contents ranged from 78.3 to 16.6 and 168.7 to 90.5 mu g/g, respectively. Compared to other kinds of astaxanthin esters, astaxanthin esters, which linked to eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid, as well as the Ast, were more easily degraded, and AM was more susceptible to degradation than AD. All-E-astaxanthin easily transformed to the 13Z-astaxanthin than to the 9Z-astaxanthin during the drying process, but the proportions of optical isomers changed due to drying by no more than 5%. The results suggested that freeze-drying, low-power microwave drying (<= 1 kW), and low-temperature hot-air drying (<= 60 degrees C) are optimal drying methods for ensuring the quality of krill products.					cong, xinyuancong/0000-0002-6665-0335												2470-1343					NOV 5	2019	4	19					17972	17980		10.1021/acsomega.9b01294							WOS:000495089100005	31720501

The surveys were the first in a newly planned five-year series of observations designed to complement and extend an existing time series regularly maintained by the British Antarctic Survey since 1996 (and on a more ad hoc basis since the early 1980s). We hoped that conducting several surveys in one season would provide information on short-term variability that could be used to set data from more restricted once-per-season 'snap-shot' cruises in a broader context. The early- and late-season surveys were associated with logistic support voyages to South Georgia and were restricted to four transects within a box to the northwest of South Georgia. The dedicated mid-season survey covered that box in more detail (twice as many transects) and, in addition, examined boxes to the north, northeast and southwest of the island. Together these surveys provided temporally and spatially extensive coverage around South Georgia. Krill density in the western box in the early-season survey was very low (3.5 g m(-2)) but rose significantly (P = 0.020) by mid-season (to 34.7 g m(-2)). In a pattern that is consistent with observations from previous years, krill density in the western box in the mid-season survey was less than that in the eastern box (80.4 g m(-2)). Analysis of transect data obtained in the western box in the mid-season survey revealed no significant difference in the mean krill density derived from only those four transects surveyed early- and late-season, or from the full eight transects. Our first occupation of a survey box off the central north coast of South Georgia in mid-season revealed a krill density of 47.2 g m(-2) that was intermediate between the eastern and western areas. The size structure of the krill in the central region also reflected a mix of those to the east (generally small) and west (generally large). Krill density to the southwest of South Georgia was 32.1 g m(-2) in mid-season. By March, krill density in the western survey area had fallen significantly (P = 0.037) from the mid-season high to 7.8 g m(-2). Our multiple surveys at South Georgia have revealed major intra-annual changes in krill density at the island and have shown that the timing of the acoustic survey can affect significantly the estimate of krill density. The multiple estimates of krill density will allow reproductive performance indices for top level predators to be compared to prey availability at more appropriate time-scales than previous single 'snap-shot' acoustic survey data have allowed. This is a crucial step in the elucidation of response functions of dependent species to changes in krill abundance, and could be a useful contribution to ecosystem management.

J	Voronina, NM				Voronina, NM			Comparative abundance and distribution of major filter-feeders in the Antarctic pelagic zone	JOURNAL OF MARINE SYSTEMS					International JGOFS Symposium on Carbon Fluxes and Dynamic Processes in the Southern Ocean - Present and Past	AUG 28-31, 1995	BREST, FRANCE	European Inst Marine Studies, Univ W Brittany				The filter-feeding plankton, herbivorous copepods, salps and euphausiids, form the basic level of metazoans in the Antarctic pelagic trophic web. This paper sets out to determine the comparative share of these taxonomic groups in the total biomass and annual production. Their most abundant representatives, four copepod species (Calanus propinquus, Calanoides acutus, Rhincalanus gigas and Metridia gerlachei), all salps and krill Euphausia superba were studied. For the first two groups net samples from six Russian expeditions in different sectors of the Antarctic were used. In total 752 samples from 118 stations were considered. The mean fresh biomass of filter-feeding copepods in the 0-1500 m layer was 18.0 g m(-2) and in the entire Antarctic 576 10(6) t. The biomass of salps in comparatively restricted rich regions exceeded 500 g m(-2) and in the remaining area was 1.2 +/- 0.8 g m(-2), giving a total quantity of 882 10(6) t. The krill abundance estimation was based on published data, using a map of its quantitative distribution compiled from commercial trawling made by Soviet fishing and scientific ships during 17 seasons [Parfenovich, S.S., 1980. O zakonomernostyakh razmeshcheniya i regionalnoi differentsiatsii mestoskoplenii krilya v Yuzhnom Okeane. VNIRO, Moskva, in Russian.]. Three main zones based on commercial characteristics were determined by this author: (I) zone of regular occurrence of dense concentrations; (2) zone of rare occurrence of concentrations; (3) zone of low-abundance dispersed krill. All available data on E. superba biomass in the Antarctic were grouped together according to these zones and their means were calculated. The biomass of krill was found to be 60.1 +/- 11.2, 3.3 +/- 1.3 and 0.8 +/- 0.4 g m(-2) fresh mass in zones i, 2 and 3, respectively, with a total of 272 10(6) t. All estimates are compared with the literature data and their validity is discussed. For the annual production determinations the obtained biomass characteristics were multiplied by published P/B coefficients. For the copepods its value was taken as 4.4 and for krill as 0.79. The total annual production of copepods was estimated as 2534 10(6) t and that of krill as 215 10(6) t (fresh mass). Salp production could not be evaluated, for lack of a sufficient database. In terms of fresh mass, the main share of filter-feeder biomass on the entire Antarctic scale belongs to salps, due to their local maxima; the second place belongs to copepods and krill comes in the third position. But after recalculation in terms of dry mass, copepods shift to the first place and salps to the last. The annual production of copepods significantly exceeds that of krill.																	0924-7963	1879-1573				NOV	1998	17	1-4					375	390		10.1016/S0924-7963(98)00050-5							WOS:000077463500026

Composition and structure of macrozooplankton and micronekton communities in the vicinity of free-drifting Antarctic icebergs	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY												Recent warming warming in the Antarctic has led to increased production of icebergs: however, the ecological effects of icebergs on pelagic communities within the Southern Ocean have not been well-studied. We used a 10 m(2) MOCNESS to collect macrozooplankton and micronekton in the upper 300 m of the water column near free-drifting icebergs in the Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean during three seasons: December 2005 (late spring), June 2008 (late fall) and March-April 2009 (late summer). Communities were dominated in all three seasons by Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) and salps (Salpa thompsoni), which collectively comprised 60-95% of the community wet biomass in most cases. During our spring and summer cruises, mean biomass was elevated by 3.1-4.3x at a distance of 0.37 km from large icebergs vs. 9.26 km away. These differences were not statistically significant, and no trend in biomass with distance was apparent in samples from fall 2008, when total biomass was an order of magnitude lower. Biomass levels near icebergs during Dec 2005 and Mar-Apr 2009 were comparable to values reported from marginal ice zones, suggesting that waters around icebergs support macrozooplankton and micronekton communities comparable in magnitude to those in some of the most productive areas of the Southern Ocean. Sample variance also was significantly higher within 1.85 km of icebergs during Dec 2005 and Mar-Apr 2009, reflecting increased patchiness on scales sampled by the MOCNESS (20-40 x 10(3) m(3) filtered per sample). This pattern was not significant during Jun 2008. Large predatory medusae were observed within 1.85 km of icebergs and in Iceberg Alley, an area through which icebergs pass frequently, but were virtually absent in areas remote from icebergs. Small euphausiids showed an inverse distribution, with low densities in areas populated by large medusae. A shift in community composition from a near-iceberg assemblage dominated by herbivores to a carnivore-dominated community in Iceberg Alley may reflect a transition from bottom-up to top-down control with increasing distance and time. Body sizes of dominant species varied seasonally but did not show consistent trends with distance from icebergs. Concentrations of photosynthetic pigments in the guts of E. superba and S. thompsoni corresponded broadly to patterns in surface chlorophyll a concentrations and were comparable to maximum gut pigment concentrations measured in animals collected from highly productive marginal ice zones. Our results suggest that the macrozooplankton and micronekton assemblages near free-drifting icebergs can be quantitatively and qualitatively different from those in surrounding, iceberg-free waters, perhaps due to both bottom-up and top-down processes as well as physical forcing by the passage of a large object through the upper ocean.

HELGOLAND MARINE RESEARCH												The role of intracontinental migration patterns of European eel (Anguilla anguilla) receives more and more recognition in both ecological studies of the European eel and possible management measures, but small-scale patterns proved to be challenging to study. We experimentally investigated the suitability of fatty acid trophic markers to elucidate the utilization of feeding habitats. Eight groups of juvenile European eels were fed on eight different diets in a freshwater recirculation system at 20A degrees C for 56 days. Three groups were fed on freshwater diets (Rutilus rutilus, Chironomidae larvae, and Gammarus pulex) and four groups were reared on diets of a marine origin (Clupea harengus, Crangon crangon, Mysis spec., and Euphausia superba) and one on commercial pellets used in eel aquaculture. Fatty acid composition (FAC) of diets differed significantly with habitat. FAC of eel muscle tissue seemed to be rather insensitive to fatty acids supplied with diet, but the general pattern of lower n3:n6 and EPA:ARA ratios in freshwater prey organisms could be traced in the respective eels. Multivariate statistics of the fatty acid composition of the eels resulted in two distinct groups representing freshwater and marine treatments. Results further indicate the capability of selectively restraining certain fatty acids in eel, as e.g. the n3:n6 ratio in all treatments was < 4, regardless of dietary n3:n6. In future studies on wild eel, these measures can be used to elucidate the utilization of feeding habitats of individual European eel.

J	Vargas, R; Osman, LP; Torres, D				Vargas, Romeo; Osman, Layla P.; Torres, Daniel			Inter-sexual differences in Antarctic fur seal pup growth rates: evidence of environmental regulation?	POLAR BIOLOGY												We investigated the variation of Antarctic fur seal (Arctocephalus gazella) pup growth rates in response to sex, breeding season and duration of both maternal foraging trip and attendance bouts. Data were collected during five consecutive rearing seasons at Cape Shirreff, the most important breeding colony in the South Shetland Islands, Antarctica. Our results showed significant interannual and sexual variations in pup growth rates. Male pups grew significantly faster than female pups during 2000, 2001, 2002 and 2004 seasons, whilst during 2003 no difference was found. The interannual variation in pup growth rates was correlated with the interannual fluctuation in maternal foraging trip and attendance bouts. There was a significant effect of pup sex and maternal foraging trip duration on pup growth rates, which varied between years having foraging trip duration a major effect during 2003, when females spent more time at sea and interestingly on that year there were no sexual differences in pup growth rates. The effect of attendance bout on pup growth rates was not significant. Diet analysis showed that Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) was the most frequent prey item during the study period. Analysis of krill size distribution showed a significant difference in krill length, during 2003, when A. gazella preyed upon the smallest sizes of krill. In this study, sex was the most important factor on pup growth rates, but when prey availability seemed more limited, there are longer foraging trips and shorter attendance bouts the sex factor became less significant.																	0722-4060	1432-2056				AUG	2009	32	8					1177	1186		10.1007/s00300-009-0615-4							WOS:000268787700008

At both shelf and oceanic station sites, zooplankton biomass, (excluding Euphausia superba), was found to be ca. 13 g dry mass m(-2). Copepods and small euphausiids dominated the catches. These estimates are over 4 times higher than values generally reported for the Southern Ocean and may reflect firstly, the high productivity of the study area, secondly, the time of year, summer, when biomass for many species is maximal, and thirdly, the high sampling efficiency of the LHPR. Principal components analysis disclosed similarities and differences between adjacent depth strata in terms of abundance, biomass and species composition. At both stations most variability occurred in the mixed layer (0-60 m) and thermocline (60-120 m) with depth horizons below this being more homogeneous. Diel migrations were observed for most taxa with abundance increasing in the mixed layer at night. At the oceanic station, species and higher taxa belonging to the mesopelagic community were generally well spread throughout this domain and, with the exception of Pleuromamma robusta and Metridia curticauda, showed little evidence of migration. The grazing impact of the epipelagic community (copepods and small euphausiids) was estimated to remove 3-4% of the microbial standing stock day(-1) and a conservative 25% and 56% of daily primary production at the oceanic and shelf stations respectively.																	0722-4060					FEB	1995	15	3					195	208									WOS:A1995QJ51000005						
J	MCKENNA, JE				MCKENNA, JE			SPATIAL STRUCTURE AND TEMPORAL CONTINUITY OF THE SOUTH GEORGIAN ANTARCTIC FISH COMMUNITY	FISHERY BULLETIN												Demersal fish represent one of the most heavily exploited resources in the Antarctic ecosystem. The stocks around South Georgia Island have contributed a substantial portion of the annual catches and have declined over the past decade. Fishing has been implicated as the cause of this decline. However, a clear description of the community structure of this system, which is necessary to judge the influence of fishing accurately, has been lacking. The spatial structure of the South Georgian fish community was investigated through the use of survey data collected over a three-year period. The results clearly indicated the absence of spatial structure in that community. The presence or absence of rare species at various stations was responsible for the weak structure found in the initial analysis. The general lack of structure was consistent from year to year. The available data do not provide an explanation for this lack of structure. All surveys were conducted during the austral summer only. Events and community structure at other times of the year remain unknown. Although the data were representative of the fish community during the austral summer, no comparable data were available on the abundance and distribution of their prey items, especially krill (Euphausia superba). More extensive sampling, expanded to include other seasons, is necessary to properly address the questions of seasonal change in community structure and the role of competition in this Antarctic system.																	0090-0656					JUL	1993	91	3					475	490									WOS:A1993MD44900007

Antarctic petrels 'on the ice rocks': wintering strategy of an Antarctic seabird	ROYAL SOCIETY OPEN SCIENCE												There is a paucity of information on the foraging ecology, especially individual use of sea-ice features and icebergs, over the non-breeding season in many seabird species. Using geolocators and stable isotopes, we defined the movements, distribution and diet of adult Antarctic petrels Thalassoica antarctica from the largest known breeding colony, the inland Svarthamaren, Antarctica. More specifically, we examined how sea-ice concentration and free-drifting icebergs affect the distribution of Antarctic petrels. After breeding, birds moved north to the marginal ice zone (MIZ) in the Weddell sector of the Southern Ocean, following its northward extension during freeze-up in April, and they wintered there in April-August. There, the birds stayed predominantly out of the water (60-80% of the time) suggesting they use icebergs as platforms to stand on and/or to rest. Feather delta N-15 values encompassed one full trophic level, indicating that birds fed on various proportions of crustaceans and fish/squid, most likely Antarctic krill Euphausia superba and the myctophid fish Electrona antarctica and/or the squid Psychroteuthis glacialis. Birds showed strong affinity for the open waters of the northern boundary of the MIZ, an important iceberg transit area, which offers roosting opportunities and rich prey fields. The strong association of Antarctic petrels with sea-ice cycle and icebergs suggests the species can serve, year-round, as a sentinel of environmental changes for this remote region.

However, identifying foraging among recorded dives often requires several assumptions. The simultaneous acquisition of images of the prey encountered, together with records of diving behavior will allow researchers to more fully investigate the nature of subsurface behavior. We tested a novel digital camera linked to a time-depth recorder on Antarctic fur seals (Arctocephalus gazella). During the austral summer 2000-2001, this system was deployed on six lactating female fur seals at Bird Island, South Georgia, each for a single foraging trip. The camera was triggered at depths greater than 10 m. Five deployments recorded still images (640 X 480 pixels) at 3-sec intervals (total 8,288 images), the other recorded movie images at 0.2-sec intervals (total 7,598 frames). Memory limitation (64 MB) restricted sampling to approximately 1.5 d of 5-7 d foraging trips. An average of 8.5% of still pictures (2.4%-11.6%) showed krill (Euphausia superba) distinctly, while at least half the images in each deployment were empty, the remainder containing blurred or indistinct prey, In one deployment krill images were recorded within 2.5 h (16 km, assuming 1.8 m/sec travel speed) of leaving the beach. Five of the six deployments also showed other fur seals foraging in conjunction with the study animal. This system is likely to generate exciting new avenues for interpretation of diving behavior.

J	Silverman, ED; Veit, RR				Silverman, ED; Veit, RR			Associations among Antarctic seabirds in mixed species feeding flocks	IBIS												We studied ten mixed-species feeding flocks of seabirds and seals off South Georgia (55 degreesS, 35 degreesW) to assess the factors that influenced the species composition of the flocks. The ten flocks were distributed between two oceanographic regions; four flocks were observed off the northwestern end of South Georgia, and six off the island's southeastern end. The flocks differed dramatically in size and species composition. The northwestern flocks were ten to 20 times larger and contained more seals and penguins. We tested whether these differences were a consequence of location, because the two regions were populated by different assemblages of species, and determined that this was not the case. Differences in flock size and species composition reflected differences in the depth distribution of the birds' and seals' prey. The northwestern flocks were associated with deep swarms of Antarctic krill Euphausia superba with a significant quantity of krill also present at the surface. We also tested for differential flock participation by the species found in the surrounding waters and classified species by their proclivity to participate in the flocks. Our results indicate that Black-browed Albatross Diomedea melanophris have a strong tendency to join, and diving-petrels Pelecanoides spp, to avoid, mixed-species feeding flocks. We postulate that Black-browed Albatrosses serve as visual cues to the presence of food for one another and for other species, and that diving-petrels avoid mixed-species flocks in part because of the risk of predation.																	0019-1019					JAN	2001	143	1					51	62		10.1111/j.1474-919X.2001.tb04169.x							WOS:000166159100007

Among Mediterranean species, haploid chromosome numbers were: n = 19 in Euphausia hemigibba, Euphausia brevis, and Nematoscelis megalops, n = 18 in Euphausia krohni, and n = 11 in Nyctiphanes couchi. Among Antarctic species, haploid chromosome numbers were: n = 17 in Euphausia superba, n = 20 in Thysanoessa macrura, and n = 13 in Thysanoessa vicina. Chromosome morphology was further studied for three species after chromosome measurements: Euphausia hemigibba karyotype showed 17 metacentric and 2 submetacentric chromosome pairs, Euphausia krohni 17 metacentric and 1 submetacentric chromosome pairs, and Nematoscelis megalops 17 metacentric and 2 submetacentric chromosome pairs. Three species sharing the same chromosome number of n = 19, i.e., Euphausia hemigibba, Nematoscelis megalops, and Meganyctiphanes norvegica were distinguished by a different slope of the decrease in chromosome size and by the presence/absence of metacentric and submetacentric chromosome pairs differing in number and position. Chromosome morphology of other species was derived from the observation of meiotic metaphases II. A majority of metacentric chromosomes was also displayed. Cytotaxonomic differences in haploid chromosome number allow the discrimination of morphologically neighboring sympatric species (e.g., Meganyctiphanes norvegica and Nyctiphanes couchi; Thysanoessa vicina and T. macrura). Euphausiids share common chromosomal features which clearly separate them from other eucarids, i.e., a narrow range of haploid chromosome number, a large chromosome size, and a majority of metacentric chromosomes.

Specimens were collected during six oceanographic cruises in Bahia Magdalena (March, July, and December 2004) and in the Gulf of California (November 2005 and January and July 2007). Females attained first spawning when similar to 7.5 mm total length (> 52 days old). Histological evidence indicates that N. simplex females have group-synchronous ovaries, able to produce four broods per gonadic cycle, since ovigerous females develop simultaneously in three and four distinct substages (Oc1, Oc2, Oc3, and Oc4) in their gonads. Once females mature, as shown by pale pink gonads, they may reabsorb their gonads in <4 days. Direct observations indicate that after a variable resting period, the formation of oogonia to vitellogenesis takes similar to 3 days, investing similar to 8% (4-14%) of weight-specific carbon body weight to reproduction (lipid approach) with an average interbrood period of 10 days (range: 7-26 days, estimated by three distinct methods). About 22% of the ovigerous females in the metanauplius stage show gonad development in vitellogenesis, likely spawning between 7 and 9 days. The rest of the female population have an interbrood period that is considerably > 10 days. Embryonic development in the ovigerous sac last <3 days (16 degrees C), hatching always as nauplius (usually 100% hatching success); the metanauplii are released from the ovigerous sac in a median of 5 days after spawning. Although sac-spawning euphausiid species may have comparatively lower total fecundity than broadcast-spawning species, they seem to have relatively similar reproductive effort and higher hatching success that increases larval recruitment rates, compared to similar size temperate broadcast-spawners. This partially explains why sac-spawners of the genera Nyctiphanes, Nematoscelis, and Pseudeuphausia are numerically dominant euphausiids in several highly eutrophic temperate, subtropical, and tropical ecosystems. N. simplex males have a continuous spermatogenesis after they attain size at first maturity; continuously allocating similar to 5.4% of weight-specific carbon to reproduction, results that are significantly different than previous assumptions that euphausiid male spermatogenesis is energetically insignificant.

Invertebrate micronekton and macrozooplankton in the Marguerite Bay region of the Western Antarctic Peninsula	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY												Invertebrate micronekton and macrozooplankton in the Marguerite Bay region of the Western Antarctic Peninsula (WAP) were sampled using a 10-m(2) MOCNESS as part of the Southern Ocean Global Ecosystem Dynamics (SO GLOBEC) program. A total of 62 trawls were completed during four separate cruises in the austral fall (April-June) and winter (July-September) of 2001 and 2002. Crustaceans dominated the system in both seasons, accounting for 32 of the 55 species captured in the fall and 30 of the 48 species captured in winter. In both seasons, a very few species made up the majority of the catch. In the fall, the euphausiids Euphausia crystallorophias, Euphausia superba, and Thysanoessa macrura, and the mysid Antarctomysis ohlinii numerically dominated the assemblage, contributing over 85% of the total. In the winter, the same three euphausiids and the chaetognath Pseudosagitta gazellae were the numerical dominants, comprising over 90% of the catch. A significant increase in total abundance and biomass was observed from 2001 to 2002. The invertebrate micronekton/macrozooplankton communities found in the Marguerite Bay region of the WAP were a mixture of oceanic and neritic fauna: a direct result of local hydrographic conditions. Near the shelf break and in the outer reaches of the Marguerite Trough, a deep canyon transecting the shelf in a south-southeast direction, the communities were more diverse, dominated by oceanic species such as Euphausia triacantha, Salpa thompsoni, and Themisto gaudichaudi. The assemblages present in the nearshore fjords exhibited lower diversity and were dominated by neritic species such as E. crystallorophias and A. ohlinii. At the mid-shelf and mid-trough locations, the assemblages were composed of a variable mixture of oceanic and neritic fauna. The faunal mixing and overall species composition in those areas is the result of episodic Circumpolar Deep Water (CDW) intrusions onto the shelf via deep bathymetric features such as the Marguerite Trough. Species diversity and integrated abundance for the upper 200 m of the water column were similar between seasons in the WAP study region, but integrated biomass was nearly three times greater in fall than in winter. Integrated estimates from the WAP study region were similar to those from other studies conducted in the Scotia and Weddell Seas, but were orders of magnitude lower than estimates from a study in Croker Passage, primarily due to a large catch of E. superba. In contrast, species diversity in the WAP was higher than recorded in any of the previously mentioned studies, which is due to the mixing of typical oceanic fauna with endemic nearshore fauna.

Intraspecific differences in the diet of Antarctic fur seals at Nyroysa, Bouvetoya	POLAR BIOLOGY												Intraspecific differences in the diets of many species of pinnipeds are to be expected in view of the great differences in morphology, life history and foraging behaviour between the sexes of many species. We examined the diet of the Antarctic fur seal population at Bouvetoya, Southern Ocean, to assess intersexual differences. This was made possible by the analysis of prey remains extracted from scats and regurgitations collected in areas used primarily by one or the other sex. The results indicate that both males and females feed primarily on Antarctic krill Euphausia superba with several species of fish and squid being taken, likely opportunistically given their prevalence. Significant differences were identified in the frequency of occurrence of otoliths in scats and the percentage numerical abundance of the major fish prey species in the diet. Adult males ate a smaller quantity of fish overall, but ate significantly more of the larger fish species. The greater diving capabilities of males and the fact that they are not limited in the extent of their foraging area by having to return regularly to feed dependant offspring may play a role in the differences found between the diets of males and females. Additionally, females might be more selective, favouring myctophids because they are richer in energy than krill. The absence of major differences in the diet between the sexes at this location is likely due to the high overall abundance of prey at Bouvetoya.

J	Fauchald, P; Tveraa, T				Fauchald, Per; Tveraa, Torkild			Hierarchical patch dynamics and animal movement pattern	OECOLOGIA												In hierarchical patch systems, small-scale patches of high density are nested within large-scale patches of low density. The organization of multiple-scale hierarchical systems makes non-random strategies for dispersal and movement particularly important. Here, we apply a new method based on first-passage time on the pathway of a foraging seabird, the Antarctic petrel (Thalassoica antarctica), to quantify its foraging pattern and the spatial dynamics of its foraging areas. Our results suggest that Antarctic petrels used a nested search strategy to track a highly dynamic hierarchical patch system where small-scale patches were congregated within patches at larger scales. The birds searched for large-scale patches by traveling fast and over long distances. Once within a large-scale patch, the birds concentrated their search to find smaller scale patches. By comparing the pathway of different birds we were able to quantify the spatial scale and turnover of their foraging areas. On the largest scale we found foraging areas with a characteristic scale of about 400 km. Nested within these areas we found foraging areas with a characteristic scale of about 100 km. The large-scale areas disappeared or moved within a time frame of weeks while the nested small-scale areas disappeared or moved within days.

J	Kato, A; Watanuki, Y; Naito, Y				Kato, A; Watanuki, Y; Naito, Y			Annual and seasonal changes in foraging site and diving behavior in Adelie penguins	POLAR BIOLOGY												Foraging sites, diet, and diving behavior of chick-rearing Adelie penguins, Pygoscelis adeliae, in fast sea-ice areas were investigated during two consecutive seasons with contrasting sea-ice conditions. During 1995/1996, fast sea ice covered the foraging range of penguins during the whole breeding season. In contrast, during 1996/1997, sea ice covered the area in December 1996, but gradually thinned and finally broke up, so that open sea appeared along the coast during February 1997. Foraging sites were concentrated in a small area in 1995/1996 and spread over a wider area in 1996/1997 as more small open-water areas were available. In both seasons, parents traveled to more distant foraging sites as the season progressed and, consequently, the foraging-trip duration increased. In both years, Euphausia superba and Pagothenia borchgrevinki dominated the diet in the early part of the season, while later in the season penguins fed mainly on E. superba in 1995/1996 and Pagothenia borchgrevinki and E. crystallorophias in 1996/1997. In 1995/1996, penguins tended to dive deeper-albeit for a relatively shorter duration-when feeding mainly on krill compared to when feeding on fish. In 1996/1997, there was no difference in the dive depth and duration between krill- and fish-eating trips. Our results suggest that prey distribution changes annually and seasonally, probably according to sea-ice conditions, and that consequently penguins modify their foraging sites, diving patterns, and diet according to these changes.

The macrozooplankton of the cosmonaut sea, east Antarctica (30 degrees E-60 degrees E),1987-1990	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART I-OCEANOGRAPHIC RESEARCH PAPERS												The macrozooplankton of the Cosmonaut Sea, Indian sector of the Southern Ocean, were investigated during the austral summers (January/February) of 1987, 1988, 1989 and 1990. Macrozooplankton samples were collected with Bongo and MT nets in the top 200 m of the water column, along with integrated temperature and salinity. Multivariate analysis of macrozooplankton density data identified a consistent division between the assemblage structure of the neritic and oceanic zones, the latter being characterized by a number of species unique to the continental shelf including Euphausia crystallorophias, Pleuragramma antarcticum and Notothenia kempi. Samples collected in the oceanic zone were all located within the Coastal Current (CC), south of the Southern Boundary of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC). However, in both 1987 and 1988 water masses of ACC origin had been injected into the CC. These intrusions were an important but inter-annually variable source of mesoscale spatial variability, being associated with distinct macrozooplankton assemblage structure and densities. Inter-annually there was considerable variation in macrozooplankton densities and biomass. Densities, dominated by Eukrohnia hamata, Thysanoessa macrura and Euphausia superba (krill), averaged similar to 250 ind.1000 m(-3) 3 from 1987 to 1989, but reached > 750 ind.1000 m(-3) in 1990, largely due to higher densities of E hamata. Biomass was dominated by krill, and total levels reflected the decline in biomass of this species from 1986 to 1990. A number of significant correlations were identified between species densities and temperature and/or salinity. However, the wide biogeographic ranges of most species indicated that these correlations were largely spurious. Overall, the differences between macrozooplankton assemblages in ACC and CC water masses within years, and the differences in macrozooplankton densities between years, most likely reflected the different histories of spatially or temporally separated water masses that were structured by a combination of bottom-up and top-down processes. Comparison of the data from this study with other regions in the Antarctic demonstrated that there is considerable circumpolar consistency in the taxonomic composition of Antarctic macrozooplankton communities, although the densities and proportional contribution of species varies both spatially and temporally. The occurrence of a krill-dominated assemblage, characterized by low densities of other species, indicates that this species has a significant top-down impact on zooplankton communities. The spatial and temporal variation in krill biomass may therefore be a significant determinant of both mesoscale and circumpolar variation in the contribution of other taxonomic groups to Antarctic zooplankton assemblages. Locally, the decline in krill biomass in the Cosmonaut Sea between 1987 and 1990 indicated a weaker connection with the Cooperation Sea to the east, where the opposite trend was observed, than previously thought. Separation between these two seas is probably facilitated in part by the anti-cyclonic gyres observed in both regions. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Penguins and Seals Transport Limiting Nutrients Between Offshore Pelagic and Coastal Regions of Antarctica Under Changing Sea Ice	ECOSYSTEMS												Large animals such as sea birds and marine mammals can transport limiting nutrients between different regions of the ocean, thereby stimulating and enhancing productivity. In Antarctica this process is influenced by formation and breakup of sea ice and its influence on the feeding behaviour of predators and their prey. We used analyses of bioactive metals (for example, Fe, Co, Mn), macronutrients (for example, N) and stable isotopes (delta C-13 and delta N-15) in the excreta of Adelie (Pygoscelis adeliae) and emperor penguins (Aptenodytes forsteri) as well as Weddell seals (Leptonychotes weddellii) from multiple sites, among multiple years (2012-2014) to resolve how changes in sea ice dynamics, as indicated by MODIS satellite images, were coincident with prey switching and likely changes in nutrient fluxes between the offshore pelagic and coastal zones. We also sampled excreta of the south polar skua (Stercorarius maccormicki), which preys on penguins and scavenges the remains of both penguins and seals. We found strong coincidence of isotopic evidence for prey switching, between euphausiids (Euphausia superba and E. crystallorophias) and pelagic/cryopelagic fishes (for example, Pleuragramma antarcticum) in penguins, and between pelagic/cryopelagic fishes and Antarctic toothfish (Dissostichus mawsoni) in Weddell seals, with changes in sea ice cover among years. Further, prey switching was strongly linked to changes in the concentrations of nutrients (Fe and N) deposited in coastal environments by both penguins and seals. Our findings have important implications for understanding how the roles of large animals in supporting coastal productivity may shift with environmental conditions in polar ecosystems.

Comparative morphology of Southern Ocean Euphausia species: ecological significance of sexual dimorphic features	POLAR BIOLOGY												Species of the genus Euphausia dominate the euphausiid biomass of the Southern Ocean, the three largest being Euphausia superba, E. triacantha and E. crystallorophias. We measured a number of morphological features to identify differences between, and within, these species to obtain ecological insights. Interspecifically, the greatest difference was carapace size, with that of E. superba being by far the largest and most variable. This likely reflects its prolific spawning capacity compared with other euphausiid species. E. triacantha exhibited an extended sixth abdominal segment that could facilitate greater levels of thrust in the tail flip escape response. The pleopods, which provide propulsion in forward swimming, were more than 50% larger in E. superba, indicating a greater capacity for directional movement at high velocities. E. crystallorophias had eyes that were almost double the size of those in E. superba and E. triacantha, which may help retain visual resolution within its under-ice habitat. Intraspecifically, we found the above morphological features differed little between sexes and developmental stages in E. crystallorophias and E. triacantha, but differed significantly in E. superba. Compared to females and juveniles, male E. superba had significantly larger eyes and pleopods, whilst the carapace in males became shorter as a proportion of body length during growth. These features indicate a greater capacity for searching and swimming in males, which, we hypothesise, increases their ability to locate and fertilise females. This morphological specialisation in male E. superba is indicative of comparatively greater inter-male competition resulting from its tendency to form large, dense swarms.

Brynn			Modeling the transport and fate of euphausiids in the Ross Sea	POLAR BIOLOGY					11th Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research Symposium	JUL 16-19, 2013	Barcelona, SPAIN					Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) and crystal krill (Euphausia crystallorophias), important components of the Ross Sea food web, differ in their population distribution. The objective of this study was to determine whether these differing distributions result primarily from differences in spawning locations, larval development times, and transport by the Ross Sea circulation. To address this objective, Lagrangian particle tracking experiments were used to simulate the transport of larvae of Antarctic krill and crystal krill. The particle simulations showed that regions providing inputs of Antarctic krill to the Ross Sea were along the outer shelf/slope. Crystal krill transport and retention were along the shallow banks on the outer Ross Sea shelf. Particles initialized in the inner shelf off Victoria Land showed high retention in the region south and along the Terra Nova Bay polynya, with timescales consistent with development times of crystal krill. These results suggest that the cyclonic circulation over the shelf contributes significantly to the dispersion and retention of crystal krill in parts of the inner Ross Sea continental shelf that overlaps with regions with high concentrations of krill-dependent top predators. The westward circulation along the shelf break contributes to the transport and aggregation of Antarctic krill in regions where Circumpolar Deep Water is observed on the outer continental shelf and along the shelf break. The transport pathways and connectivity obtained from this study provide a baseline for assessing the effects of projected changes in the Ross Sea circulation on the distribution of two important krill species.

At present, however, little information is available about allergens in edible crustaceans other than decapods. In this study, the major allergen in two species of edible crustaceans, Antarctic krill Euphausia superba and mantis shrimp Oratosquilla oratoria that are taxonomically distinct from decapods, was demonstrated to be tropomyosin by IgE-immunoblotting using patient sera. The cross-reactivity of the tropomyosins from both species with decapod tropomyosins was also confirmed by inhibition IgE immunoblotting. Sequences of the tropomyosins from both species were determined by complementary deoxyribonucleic acid cloning. The mantis shrimp tropomyosin has high sequence identity (> 90% identity) with decapod tropomyosins, especially with fast-type tropomyosins. On the other hand, the Antarctic krill tropomyosin is characterized by diverse alterations in region 13-42, the amino acid sequence of which is highly conserved for decapod tropomyosins, and hence, it shares somewhat lower sequence identity (82.4-89.8% identity) with decapod tropomyosins than the mantis shrimp tropomyosin. Quantification by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay revealed that Antarctic krill contains tropomyosin at almost the same level as decapods, suggesting that its allergenicity is equivalent to decapods. However, mantis shrimp was assumed to be substantially not allergenic because of the extremely low content of tropomyosin.

J	Stubing, D; Hagen, W				Stubing, D; Hagen, W			Fatty acid biomarker ratios - suitable trophic indicators in Antarctic euphausiids?	POLAR BIOLOGY												Fatty-acid biomarkers are frequently used for the identification of trophic relationships among marine zooplankton. We have evaluated the suitability of five fatty-acid ratios [16:0/16:1(n-7), 16:1(n-7)/18:4(n-3), 18:1(n-9)/18:1(n-7), 20:5(n-3)/22:6(n-3), PUFA/SFA] that have been proposed as trophic indicators in the literature. Total lipid content and fatty-acid composition were determined in four Antarctic euphausiid species (Euphausia superba, E. frigida, E. triacantha, Thysanoessa macrura). There is a significant relationship between the lipid content and most of these ratios in the investigated euphausiids. Only the 16:1(n-7)/18:4(n-3) ratio exhibits no clear relationship to total lipids. Further exceptions occur in E. triacantha: the 18:1(n-9)/18:1(n-7) and the 20:5(n-3)/22:6(n-3) ratios are not correlated to the lipid content in this species. There is a weaker correlation between the fatty-acid ratios and the total lipid content in E. superba larvae than in the postlarvae, indicating a stronger dietary influence on the lipids of the younger stages. We conclude that those fatty-acid ratios that strongly depend on an animal's total lipid content (particularly PUFA/SFA), are only of limited use as trophic indices, since total lipid content may vary greatly with factors (such as reproductive processes) that are unrelated to specific feeding preferences.

A total of 2956 leopard seal sightings were made, and 121 seals were tagged during the study, mainly between 1993 and 1996. Photographs of scars and pelage patterns were also used to identify a subset of these individuals across years, which provided no evidence of tag loss between or within years. Leopard seals were observed between April and November; the mean time between the first and last sightings in each year was 208 d (s d +/- 48). Between 1993-96, eight seals were resident around the island for more than 100 d, and the longest recorded residence was 130 d. The proportion of tagged seals resighted was 0.35 and 0.17 in 1995 and 1996 respectively. Based on estimates of body length, <5% of the seals were juveniles (0-1 years) and >70% were not sexually mature. There was considerable inter-annual variation in abundance, with a maximum of 502 sightings during 1994, compared with a minimum of 21 during 1986 and 1989. Antarctic fur seals (Arctocephalus gazella) were the main prey item (58% of kills observed and 53% of seats). Other items included penguins (28% of kills observed and 20% of seats) and fish (24% of seats). Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba), southern elephant seals (Mirounga leonina) and seabirds other than penguins were also present in the diet in small quantities.				Tony R.

The albatrosses foraged mostly over oceanic waters, probably associated with the Polar Front north of South Georgia, and also over shelf-slope waters around the Antarctic Peninsula. After leaving the colony, birds commuted to areas with predictable prey concentrations, where they remained for several days. During search periods, birds landed more often and had a higher intake rate, but spent the same proportion of time in flight as on commuting days. Although intake rates were particularly high in shelf-break waters around the Antarctic Peninsula (only one individual foraged in this area), prey were also consumed in reasonable quantities during commuting flights. While at sea, birds spent most (81%) of the day flying, and most (94%) of the night resting on the water. A considerable proportion (26% by mass) of prey was consumed during darkness. The majority of prey were detected and captured during search flights, but 35% were located while sitting on the sea surface. Many ingestion events (up to 27% of the overall food intake) showed temperature signatures characteristic of fluids, suggesting that albatrosses may feed on gelatinous and rapidly digested prey (e.g. salps and jellyfish) much more often than previously suspected. Diet samples delivered to the chicks comprised mostly squid (particularly Martialia hyadesi) and Antarctic krill Euphausia superba.

J	Murphy, EJ; Thorpe, SE; Watkins, JL; Hewitt, R				Murphy, EJ; Thorpe, SE; Watkins, JL; Hewitt, R			Modeling the krill transport pathways in the Scotia Sea: spatial and environmental connections generating the seasonal distribution of krill	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY												A coupled physical-biological model analysis was undertaken to examine the seasonal development of the distribution of antarctic krill (Euphausia superba Dana) in the Scotia Sea. The origin and fate of krill observed during the CCAMLR 2000 survey were studied using output from the OCCAM model. Lagrangian particle tracking for the period prior to the survey showed the expected dominance of the west to east flow of material associated with the main direction of the current flow, but there was no simple association of particle transport with any of the fronts of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current. Most of the krill were associated with areas to the south of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current in the Weddell-Scotia Confluence (WSC) and farther east in Weddell Sea-influenced waters. Examining the pathways of krill transport in relation to satellite-derived sea-ice distributions suggests that particles present in the high krill biomass regions in January would have come from areas that were covered by sea-ice during late winter/early spring (September-October). The results of Eulerian grid-based simulations of the development of the biomass distribution after the survey period showed transport of particles around South Georgia, probably in association with the Southern Antarctic Circumpolar Current Front. However, many of the krill encountered in the eastern Scotia Sea would have exited toward the east, passing north of the South Sandwich Islands, probably in association with the Southern Boundary of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current and Weddell Sea waters that penetrate to the north in this area. These krill may return to more southern regions where further spawning is possible in later years. Simulations of particle tracks that included diurnal vertical migration showed that krill behavior could modify the pathways of transport, although the current flows probably dominate the movement of krill in open ocean regions. This study suggests that the summer distribution of krill in the Scotia Sea is connected to the winter sea-ice distribution and probably to the pattern and rate of the spring sea-ice retreat. Many of the krill in the survey region in the summer of 1999/2000 came from under the sea-ice in the eastern Scotia Sea, the southern Scotia Arc, and the northern Weddell Sea. This highlights that the spatial association of the sea-ice with the Weddell-Scotia Confluence and frontal regions of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current during winter and spring will be crucial in determining the summer krill distribution. Variation in the extent and timing of sea-ice retreat, and fluctuations in Weddell-Scotia Confluence and Scotia Sea flows, will change the pathways of transport resulting in large changes in the distribution of the krill during summer.

Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) eat diatoms and recycle iron in surface waters when feeding. Baleen whales eat krill, and, historically, defecation by baleen whales could have been a major mechanism for recycling iron, if whale faeces contain significant quantities of iron. We analysed the iron content in 27 samples of faeces from four species of baleen whale. Faecal iron content (145.9 +/- 133.7 mg kg(-1)) is approximately ten million times that of Antarctic seawater, suggesting that it could act as a fertilizer. Furthermore, we analysed the iron content of seven krill species and of muscle tissue of two species of baleen whales; all samples had high iron levels. Using these figures, together with recent estimates of the range and biomass of krill, we calculate that the Antarctic krill population contains similar to 24% of the total iron in the surface waters in its range. Thus, krill can act as a long-term reservoir of iron in Antarctic surface waters, by storing the iron in their body tissue. Pre-exploitation populations of whales and krill must have stored larger quantities of iron and would have also recycled more iron in surface waters, enhancing overall ocean productivity through a positive feedback loop. Thus, allowing the great whales to recover might actually increase Southern Ocean productivity through enhancing iron levels in the surface layer.				van der Merwe, Pier C/C-9210-2015; Lannuzel, Delphine/J-7937-2014; Bowie, Andrew/C-8677-2013; Jarman, Simon/H-9265-2016	van der Merwe, Pier C/0000-0002-7428-8030; Lannuzel, Delphine/0000-0001-6154-1837; Bowie, Andrew/0000-0002-5144-7799; Jarman, Simon/0000-0002-0792-9686												1467-2960					JUN	2010	11	2					203	209		10.1111/j.1467-2979.2010.00356.x							WOS:000277692300007

Histophagous ciliate Pseudocollinia brintoni and bacterial assemblage interaction with krill Nyctiphanes simplex. II. Host responses	DISEASES OF AQUATIC ORGANISMS												Unlike decapod crustaceans of commercial interest, the krill defense system and its response to parasites and pathogens is virtually unknown. Histophagous ciliates of the genus Pseudocollinia interact with at least 7 krill species in the northeastern Pacific. Although they can cause epizootic events, the physiology of the histophagous ciliate-host interaction and krill (host) defenses remain unknown. From 1 oceanographic survey along the southwestern coast of the Baja California Peninsula near Bahia Magdalena and 2 in the Gulf of California, we investigated parasitoid-host physiological responses (fatty acid and oxidative stress indicators) of the subtropical krill Nyctiphanes simplex infected with the ciliate P. brintoni. All life stages of P. brintoni were associated with opportunistic bacterial assemblages that have not been explicitly investigated in other Pseudocollinia species (P. beringensis, P. oregonensis, and P. similis). Parasitoid ciliates exclusively infected adult females, which showed increased lipid content during gonad development. As the infection progressed, omega-3 eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic fatty acids, which may act as energy sources to produce high numbers of ciliate transmission stages, were quickly depleted. Antioxidant enzymes, components of the crustacean defense system, varied throughout infection, but without inhibiting Pseudocollinia infection, i.e. higher levels of lipid oxidative damage were detected in late stages of infection. The ineffective response of the krill antioxidant defense system against histophagous ciliates and the bacteria associated with the ciliates suggests that Pseudocollinia ciliates are functionally analogous to krill predators and may have a strong influence on the population dynamics of krill.

Nevertheless, only in gentoo penguins a shift in the diet was evident from mainly krill during the breeding stage to mixed diet (i.e. krill and fish/squids) during the pre-and post-breeding stages. Results from stable isotopes suggest that Adelie penguins might be foraging in southern localities compared to their congener during the inter-breeding period. Moreover, Adelie penguins showed a large individual variability in foraging habitat during the post-breeding stage. However, our model has predicted that both species exploited similar areas during the breeding season. The results obtained during the chick-rearing stage were compared with the stomach contents of both species obtained during the same season (2011/2012). Our findings provide new knowledge on the feeding ecology and foraging habitats of pygoscelid penguins. They confirm the importance of Antarctic krill during the annual cycle and improve the understanding of life strategies and predator-prey interactions essentially out of the reproductive period, in which the information is very limited. These results can help to establish new management strategies, particularly considering the potential overlap between predators and fisheries.

Here, we investigated the anti-inflammatory and antioxidative effects of krill oil. Oil from Euphausia superba (Antarctic krill), an Antarctic marine species, is rich in eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). We examined whether krill oil diet (80 mg/kg/day for one month) prevents amyloidogenesis and cognitive impairment induced by intraperitoneal lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (250 mu g/kg, seven times daily) injections in AD mice model and found that krill oil treatment inhibited the LPS-induced memory loss. We also found that krill oil treatment inhibited the LPS-induced expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and decreased reactive oxygen species (ROS) and malondialdehyde levels. Krill oil also suppresses I kappa B degradation as well as p50 and p65 translocation into the nuclei of LPS-injected mice brain cells. In association with the inhibitory effect on neuroinflammation and oxidative stress, krill oil suppressed amyloid beta (1-42) peptide generation by the down-regulating APP and BACE1 expression in vivo. We found that eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) (50 and 100 mu M) dose-dependently decreased LPS-induced nitric oxide and ROS generation, and COX-2 and iNOS expression as well as nuclear factor-kappa B activity in cultured microglial BV-2 cells. These results suggest that krill oil ameliorated impairment via anti-inflammatory, antioxidative, and anti-amyloidogenic mechanisms.

Larvae of Euphausia crystallorophias Holt and Tattersall and Thysanoessa macrura G.O. Sars were observed in the study area every year in contrast to larvae of Euphausia superba which were absent during the entire period of sampling. Highest abundances of both species were observed during the summer of 2005 and the lowest in the summer of 2004. Larvae of E. crystallorophias dominated every year and comprised more than 80% of the total abundance of euphausiid larvae. Within species, the calyptopis stages especially calyptopis 1 of E. crystallorophias dominated compared to furcilia stages of T. macrura which were less abundant. For both species, spatio-temporal variations in abundances of developmental stages were significantly correlated to density and salinity of the deep water layer. In the case of calyptopis 3 of E. crystallorophias, spatio-temporal variations were correlated with the number of days between the end of the sea ice retreat and the sampling day and for T. macrura inversely correlated to temperature of surface water layer. These variations are discussed and related to the timing of sea ice retreat, the sea ice concentration as well as metabolic conditions of adults of both species during their spawning period.

J	NAGY, KA; OBST, BS				NAGY, KA; OBST, BS			FOOD AND ENERGY-REQUIREMENTS OF ADELIE PENGUINS (PYGOSCELIS-ADELIAE) ON THE ANTARCTIC PENINSULA	PHYSIOLOGICAL ZOOLOGY												Adelie penguins (mean body mass 3.81 kg) brooding small chicks bad field metabolic rates (FMRs, measured using doubly labeled water) averaging 1.64 mL CO2 g-1 h-1, equivalent to 3,896 kj d-1 and 3.8 times basal metabolic rate (BMR). Energy utilization while on the nest was 2.0 X BMR, and it was 5.4 X BMR when off the nest, including time spent foraging at sea. These FMRs are higher than in other species of penguins and may reflect an intense foraging effort associated with a relative scarcity of food during our study. The penguins ate only krill (Euphausia superba), primarily juveniles of intermediate size, which contain much water, little lipid, and relatively low metabolizable energy content compared to gravid female krill. Low water intake rates indicated that the penguins did not drink much fresh water or seawater and that they did not consume quite enough food to pay their own energy expenses after feeding their chicks. Their utilization of body fat to pay the difference should have amounted to about 33 g d-1 during this phase of the breeding cycle. We estimated that the 25,500 Adelie penguins using the Arthur Harbor area around Palmer Station would consume about 27.5 metric tons of krill each day. Six hundred twelve penguins (total biomass of 2,330 kg) would consume about the same amount of krill per day as does one Antarctic fin whale weighing 48,000 kg.																	0031-935X					NOV-DEC	1992	65	6					1271	1284		10.1086/physzool.65.6.30158279							WOS:A1992KP95800012

To quantify the importance of this sympagic carbon' during summer, the three most abundant Antarctic euphausiids, Euphausia superba, E. crystallorophias, and Thysanoessa macrura, collected off the Filchner Ice Shelf, were analyzed regarding their fatty acid (FA) and stable isotope compositions. Fingerprints of diatom- and dinoflagellate-associated FAs in the euphausiids indicated a mixed carbon source composition for all three species. Bulk and FA-specific carbon stable isotope compositions (C-13) were used to quantify the contribution of sympagic carbon versus phytoplankton-produced carbon to the euphausiids' carbon budget, suggesting a lower proportional contribution of sympagic carbon in E. superba (5-18%) compared to E. crystallorophias (16-36%) and T. macrura (15-36%). The latter two species probably received sympagic carbon through heterotrophic prey, a hitherto overlooked source of sympagic carbon for pelagic species. Euphausiids collected close to the surface indicated a higher importance of sympagic carbon to their carbon budget compared to individuals caught at greater depths. Our results imply that, in the southern Weddell Sea, ice algae play a significant, but possibly not critical role as a carbon source for the three euphausiids during summer. Their ability to utilize carbon of different origins implies a certain resilience to environmental change during summer. The winter period, however, remains the critical bottle neck of survival when Antarctic sea ice declines, because during this season of minimal pelagic productivity, ice algae standing stocks constitute the only dependable carbon source.

The diet of juvenile Bathydraco marri Norman, 1938 was studied for the first time in specimens collected in the southwestern Ross Sea during summer 1998. Fish were collected in a single otter trawl catch at 330-340 m depth. The stomach content analysis showed that this species fed exclusively on crustaceans. Overall, 20 prey taxa were identified to genus or species level. Mysids, amphipods and copepods were the most important prey in decreasing order of importance. Other prey, such as Euphausia superba, isopods and tanaids were eaten occasionally and in very small amounts. A multivariate analysis was applied to feeding data to assess ontogenetic or sex-related changes in diet. No difference was detected between sexes, whereas diet of small and large fish differed in some degree. An ontogenetic shift from small and pelagic crustaceans such as copepods to benthic-benthopelagic prey such as amphipods and mysids was observed. Relating present results with published data on physiological characteristics of B. marri, it was possible to infer their feeding behaviour and mode of life. Like other bathydraconids, this species appeared to be an inactive and sluggish fish, which relied on more or less motile benthic or epibenthic prey adopting a "sit and wait" feeding strategy. On the other hand, smaller fish seem to be more active, feeding also on pelagic prey such as copepods that can be seasonally abundant, thus reducing the intraspecific competition for food.

The Anisakis simplex complex off the South Shetland Islands (Antarctica): endemic populations versus introduction through migratory hosts	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												Third-stage larvae (L3) of 2 Anisakis nematode species, A. simplex C and A. pegreffii (both A. Simplex sibling species complex), were isolated from migrating myctophids around the South Shetland Islands. Gymnoscopelus nicholsi were parasitized by both nematode species, at a prevalence of 22.7 % for A. simplex C and 4.0% for A. pegreffii, while Electrona carlsbergi harbored A. simplex C at a prevalence of 9.1 %. The ITS-1, 5.8S, and ITS-2 regions of the nematodes were identical to specimens from Pacific Canada or California (A. simplex C) and the coast of China (A. pegreffii), confirming an extensive range of distribution for both species. The occurrence in migrating myctophids coupled with rare findings from other teleosts leads to the conclusion that both species were introduced from outside the Antarctic. Consequently, they are at their most southern range in the Southern Ocean, and an earlier molecular record of A. simplex C from the elephant seal Mirounga leonina may have detected an accidental case of infection. Delphinids, which frequently occur along South America but not in the Southern Ocean, are suggested as being the typical final hosts in the life cycles of A. simplex C and A. pegreffii. The myctophids had only few prey items within their stomachs, dominated by euphausiids, including Euphausia superba and planktonic copepods. These are common intermediate hosts for anisakid nematodes and are an important component of the Antarctic food web, Regular introduction events through migrating whales and myctophids are considered responsible for the occurrence of Anisakis infection in the high Antarctic.																	0171-8630						2010	403						1	11		10.3354/meps08501							WOS:000276799000001

Its diet is dominated by Antarctic krill Euphausia superba; in turn, it is also an important prey of a number of tipper trophic level predators, as well as being the target of commercial fisheries. Data on the frequency and size structure of mackerel icefish in the diet of Antarctic fur seals Arctocephalus gazella and gentoo penguins Pygoscelis papua from 1991 to 2002 were used to examine trophic interactions involving this species and to evaluate the potential impact of predators on its population. Mackerel icefish occurred in 10 to 20 % of scats from Antarctic fur seals and comprised 48 % of the diet by mass of gentoo penguins. The contribution of mackerel icefish to the diet of predators was in inverse proportion to the contribution of Antarctic krill. The length-frequency distributions of mackerel icefish indicated a dominant mode at 130 to 180 mm total length (the 1+ age class), with apparent strong cohorts entering the population in 1993, 1996, 1999 and 2001. Extrapolation of diet data to produce a consumption estimate for the South Georgia population of Antarctic fur seals and gentoo penguins suggests that scientific trawl surveys may underestimate the standing stock of mackerel icefish by I order of magnitude. Changes in the South Georgia ecosystem over the past 2 decades may have increased the level of consumption of mackerel icefish by predators, providing a potential ecosystem-based explanation for the lack of a recovery to the pre-exploitation population size.				, Martin/ABE-6728-2020; Collins, Martin A/J-8560-2017; Simeon, Hill L/B-2307-2008													0171-8630	1616-1599					2005	305						153	161		10.3354/meps305153							WOS:000235079200013

Ecological drivers of change at South Georgia: the krill surplus, or climate variability	ECOGRAPHY												Macaroni penguins Eudyptes chrysolophus are thought to be one of the most important mesopredators in the Southern Ocean having a greater impact on prey availability and abundance than any other seabird species. Their population centre has long been held to be South Georgia where populations were thought to comprise many million animals. Here we report the results of a recent census of the macaroni population at South Georgia undertaken using aerial survey methods. We report dramatic declines in numbers (similar to 1.0 million breeding pairs) compared to numbers observed in the late 1970s (similar to 5.4 million pairs), but show that these reductions have occurred principally at sites where numbers had previously been very large. During the breeding season, the main foraging grounds of birds from these sites overlap with the foraging grounds of Antarctic fur seals Arctocephalus gazella, a major competitor for their principal prey, Antarctic krill Euphausia superba. We suggest that the redistribution of the macaroni penguin population at South Georgia reflects the recent recovery of fur seal populations and thus the ongoing consequences of human intervention at South Georgia, a process which started more than 2 centuries previously. The implied resource competition and the observed population changes may also be exacerbated by recent reductions in Antarctic krill abundance which have been linked with reductions in seasonal sea ice following recent, rapid, regional warming in the Antarctic; however, the recovery of fur seal populations, and the ongoing recovery of krill-eating whale populations argues that tropho-dynamic interactions may be sufficient to explain the observed changes.

It is, however, very important that the resource is utilized in a sustainable manner in terms of efficiency and selectivity, which can be enhanced through proper design of pelagic trawls that are used for harvesting the species. Pelagic trawls rely heavily on hydrodynamic forces acting on the netting to form desirable shapes. It is thus crucial to understand hydrodynamic forces acting on the trawl to predict its performance. A large Antarctic krill trawl with a net opening circumference of 200 m was designed for a fishing vessel (2855 kW) and analyzed by numerical simulation and physical model tests. A numerical model of Antarctic krill trawl was established based on the finite element method. The principle of minimum potential energy was employed to determine the equilibrium configuration and the tension distribution of the trawl in a uniform current. The Newton-Raphson method was applied to solve the equilibrium equation. A series of physical model tests were conducted in a flume tank to verify the result from numerical simulation. The results showed that the trawl with a net opening circumference of 200 m had superior hydrodynamic performance and could be well matched with fishing vessels of the class for the efficient production of Antarctic krill. This paper demonstrates the use of scientific methods for the design of large Antarctic krill trawls and the application of numerical simulation to study the hydrodynamic performance.																	0029-8018					MAY 1	2019	179						173	179		10.1016/j.oceaneng.2019.03.022							WOS:000466453800015

O. Sars" with port-orientated beams. Each ping samples a volume of 60 degrees horizontally x 45 degrees vertically with 500 beams, which is often enough to insonify a complete school of fish or zooplankton. The large amount of resulting data is efficiently preprocessed with automatic, real-time detections of school candidates; these are accepted or rejected during post-processing. The system was used on the continental shelf near the Subantarctic island of South Georgia to study Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba), and some of the detected schools were immediately sampled with a six-frequency echosounder (Simrad EK60), then trawled with various nets to verify the target species and their size composition. For schools acoustically categorized as euphausiids, data from the two acoustic systems were used to estimate the school morphometrics and the krill size distributions. The principal objectives of this study were to explore the potential of combining data from a multibeam sonar, multifrequency echosounders, and nets, and to describe the efficient processing methods and software that facilitate the multi-instrument analyses. Three-dimensional morphometrics based on the MS70 data were consistent with corresponding two-dimensional morphometrics based on the echosounder data and could be used to improve the acoustic classifications of taxa or species. Additionally, automatic preprocessing and integration of data from different sources into the same user interface allowed efficient exploration and interpretation of all the acoustic data.

Stable isotopes reveal regional heterogeneity in the pre-breeding distribution and diets of sympatrically breeding Pygoscelis spp. penguins	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												While the foraging ecology of the Adelie penguin Pygoscelis adeliae and gentoo penguin P. papua has been well studied, little is known on the distribution and diet of these species outside the breeding season. In the present study we used stable carbon (delta C-13) and nitrogen (delta N-15) isotope analyses of eggshells to examine the pre-breeding diets and foraging habitats of female Adelie and gentoo penguins from 23 breeding colonies along the eastern and western Antarctic Peninsula (AP), South Shetland Islands, and South Orkney Islands, in 2006. Adelie penguin eggshells from the eastern AP, South Shetland Islands, and South Orkney Islands shared similar isotopic signatures and were significantly lower in both delta C-13 and delta N-15 values than eggshells from birds breeding along the western AP. This result suggests that Adelie penguin populations that are geographically separated during the breeding season by the Adelie 'gap,' a 400 km region in the western AP devoid of breeding Adelie penguins, also inhabit geographically distinct habitats during the late winter prior to the breeding season. To a lesser degree, gentoo penguin eggshell isotope values also varied across breeding colonies, which likely reflects local scale variation in their near-shore foraging grounds. Furthermore, unlike the breeding period when krill (primarily Euphausia superba) dominates penguin diets in these regions, our findings suggest that fish and/or other high trophic-level prey species comprise a significant portion (46.8 to 62.9%) of female Adelie and gentoo penguin diets prior to breeding.

The dissected stomachs of 61 specimens were classified according to fullness and the contents were examined visually. Identifiable food items included fish sagittal otoliths, crustacean eyes, the lappets on euphausiid first antennule segments and cephalopod sucker rings. The most frequent items in the squid's diet were the myctophid fishes Krefftichthys anderssoni and Electrona carlsbergi, the euphausiid Euphausia superba and a hyperiid amphipod, probably Themisto gaudichaudi. A small proportion of the sample had been feeding cannibalistically. Total lengths of the fish prey were estimated from sagittal otolith size using published relationships. All fish were relatively small; 7 to 35% of squid mantle-length. However, it is possible that some heads of larger fish are discarded by the squid and so are not represented by otoliths in the stomach contents. Over the size range of squid in the sample there was no relationship between size of fish prey and size of squid. Similarly, when the squid sample was divided into groups according to prey categories: crustaceans, crustaceans + fish, fish, cephalopod, there was no evidence that dietary preference was related to squid size. The prevalence of copepod-feeding myctophids in the diet of this squid, which is itself a major prey item of some higher predators in the Scotia Sea, suggests that a previously unrecognised food chain: copepod - myctophid - M. hyadesi - higher predator, may be an important component of the Antarctic oceanic ecosystem.

Contrasting specialist and generalist patterns facilitate foraging niche partitioning in sympatric populations of Pygoscelis penguins	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												Specialization is a common mechanism of niche differentiation that can lead to ecological co-existence among species. However, species with specialized habitat or dietary requirements often exhibit a high degree of sensitivity to environmental change. Understanding patterns of specialization and niche segregation among Antarctic marine predators is of increased importance because of recent climate-driven reductions in a key prey species, Antarctic krill Euphausia superba. We examined the stomach contents and stable isotope values of sympatric chinstrap Pygoscelis antarctica and gentoo P. papua penguins across 5 breeding seasons at Cape Shirreff, Livingston Island, Antarctica. Our goal was to examine foraging niche segregation and the degree of specialization between species during the chick-rearing period. Dietary and isotopic foraging niches indicated consistent niche partitioning with higher krill consumption and greater use of offshore foraging habitats by chinstrap relative to gentoo penguins. While chinstrap penguin diets were dominated by krill with little variation, gentoo penguins exhibited broader dietary and isotopic niches with a higher degree of variation. There was little evidence that shifts in the availability of adult krill influenced penguin diets or foraging niches during our study, though the contrasting foraging strategies identified provide insight into the differing population trends observed between penguin species. The narrower foraging niche observed in declining chinstrap penguin populations indicates that they are likely highly sensitive to declines in the abundance of Antarctic krill. In contrast, the generalist niche exhibited by recently expanding gentoo penguin populations is likely better suited to the rapidly changing environmental conditions in the Antarctic Peninsula.

Long-term trends in albatross diets in relation to prey availability and breeding success	MARINE BIOLOGY												Diet analyses can reveal important changes in seabird foraging ecology and, by inference, resource availability and predator-prey dynamics within the wider marine ecosystem. Here, we analysed stomach contents of 1544 grey-headed albatross Thalassarche chrysostoma (GHA) and black-browed albatross T. melanophris (BBA) chicks from Bird Island, South Georgia. We describe dietary shifts (1996-2017), and link those to annual prey availability indices and breeding success. Annual variability in diet was high, and long-term trends in the main components were broadly similar in both albatrosses. Fish consumption (by mass) generally increased over time. Mackerel icefish Champsocephalus gunnari occurrence increased in GHA diets, but was unrelated to local densities derived from fisheries/research cruises. Cephalopod consumption declined until the early 2000s, then plateaued, and the occurrence of the ommastrephid squid Martialia hyadesi declined over time in both albatrosses. In BBAs, Antarctic krill Euphausia superba consumption decreased over time. Conversely, Antarctic krill consumption by GHAs increased until the early 2000s, decreased until the mid-2010s, and increased again in 2017. Antarctic krill consumption was unrelated to local densities based on acoustic surveys, and did not correlate with breeding success. Remotely sensed chlorophyll-a within core foraging areas showed a positive relationship with Antarctic krill in GHA diets, but a negative relationship with M. hyadesi occurrence in both albatross diets. Dietary shifts had consequences for GHA breeding success, which was negatively related to the importance of the cranchiid Galiteuthis glacialis and positively related to M. hyadesi importance. These results highlight the complex mechanisms linking prey availability, diet and breeding success in albatrosses.

J	Mori, M; Butterworth, DS				Mori, M; Butterworth, DS			Consideration of multispecies interactions in the Antarctic: A preliminary model of the minke whale - Blue whale - Krill interaction	AFRICAN JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE					Workshop on Ecosystem Approaches to Fisheries Management in the Southern Benguela	DEC 04-06, 2002	Cape Town, SOUTH AFRICA					As a first step in investigating the major predator-prey interactions in the Antarctic, a model describing blue whales Balaenoptera musculus, minke whales Balaenoptera acutorostrata and krill Euphausia superba is developed. Blue and minke whales feed mainly on krill, and they share a similar feeding area near the Antarctic ice edge. In the early 20(th) century, the large baleen whales in the Antarctic were heavily harvested, some to near extinction. Blue whales were taken for almost 60 years, before being officially protected in 1964. Harvesting of the smaller minke whales commenced only in the 1970s, and the population probably increased during the mid 20th century, likely in response to increased krill abundance following the depletion of the large baleen whales. Recent studies show recoveries of some of these large baleen whale species in response to protection, and also a possible recent decrease in the stock of minke whales as the larger whales recover. This work investigates whether the abundance trends indicated by surveys and other information for these species can be explained by considering only harvesting and the predator-prey interactions between the two whale species and krill. Using historical catch data for blue and minke whales, a simple age-aggregated model including species interactions is fitted to survey abundance estimates. Uncertainties in the abundance estimates and the biological parameters are taken into account in the process by considering plausible ranges for their values. Abundance trends for the species can broadly be replicated by the model, provided the parameter values show certain features, including (i) that blue whales are able to maintain their birth and krill consumption rates until krill abundance drops to relatively low levels, and (ii) that both minke and blue whales show relatively fast rates of growth if krill is abundant, but that minke growth rate falls more rapidly as krill abundance drops. The model suggests two interesting features of the dynamics of these species. First, a substantial decrease in krill biomass from the 1970s to the 1990s as a result of the preceding rapid increase in minke whale abundance, and hence krill consumption, following the depletion of the larger baleen whales. Second, a recovery of blue whales despite the impact of minke whales on krill abundance and its resultant decrease, because blue whales are better able to tolerate decreased krill abundance. Future projections show a gradual increasing trend in blue whale abundance and a gradual decrease in minke abundance, with large amplitude oscillations superimposed. Long-term monitoring of biological parameters and abundance are essential to provide a basis for verification or otherwise of such predictions. Results presented here should be viewed qualitatively rather than quantitatively. However, for the future, refinement of the model structure and incorporation of age structure, data on some other major predator species that feed on krill and some spatial structure, is under consideration.

R.; Thorpe, Sally E.; Ward, Peter; Atkinson, Angus			Do pelagic grazers benefit from sea ice? Insights from the Antarctic sea ice proxy IPSO25	BIOGEOSCIENCES												Sea ice affects primary production in polar regions in multiple ways. It can dampen water column productivity by reducing light or nutrient supply, provide a habitat for ice algae and condition the marginal ice zone (MIZ) for phytoplankton blooms on its seasonal retreat. The relative importance of three different carbon sources (sea ice derived, sea ice conditioned, non-sea-ice associated) for the polar food web is not well understood, partly due to the lack of methods that enable their unambiguous distinction. Here we analysed two highly branched isoprenoid (HBI) biomarkers to trace sea-ice-derived and sea-ice-conditioned carbon in Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) and relate their concentrations to the grazers' body reserves, growth and recruitment. During our sampling in January-February 2003, the proxy for sea ice diatoms (a di-unsaturated HBI termed IPSO25, delta C-13 = -12.5 +/- 3.3 parts per thousand) occurred in open waters of the western Scotia Sea, where seasonal ice retreat was slow. In suspended matter from surface waters, IPSO25 was present at a few stations close to the ice edge, but in krill the marker was widespread. Even at stations that had been ice-free for several weeks, IPSO25 was found in krill stomachs, suggesting that they gathered the ice-derived algae from below the upper mixed layer. Peak abundances of the proxy for MIZ diatoms (a tri-unsaturated HBI termed HBI III, delta C-13 = -42.2 +/- 2.4 parts per thousand) occurred in regions of fast sea ice retreat and persistent salinity-driven stratification in the eastern Scotia Sea. Krill sampled in the area defined by the ice edge bloom likewise contained high amounts of HBI III. As indicators for the grazer's performance we used the mass-length ratio, size of digestive gland and growth rate for krill, and recruitment for the biomass-dominant calanoid copepods Calanoides acutus and Calanus propinquus. These indices consistently point to blooms in the MIZ as an important feeding ground for pelagic grazers. Even though ice-conditioned blooms are of much shorter duration than blooms downstream of the permanently sea-ice-free South Georgia, they enabled fast growth and offspring development. Our study shows two rarely considered ways that pelagic grazers may benefit from sea ice: firstly, after their release from sea ice, suspended or sinking ice algae can supplement the grazers' diet if phytoplankton concentrations are low. Secondly, conditioning effects of seasonal sea ice can promote pelagic primary production and therefore food availability in spring and summer.

A central mechanism hypothesised to underlie the CTMAX of water-breathing ectotherms is insufficient tissue oxygen supply for vital maintenance functions because of a temperature-induced collapse of the cardiorespiratory system. The CTMAX of species conforming to this hypothesis should decrease with declining water oxygen tension (PO2) because they have oxygen-dependent upper thermal limits. However, recent studies have identified a number of fishes and crustaceans with oxygen-independent upper thermal limits, their CTMAX unchanged in progressive aquatic hypoxia. The previous studies, which were performed separately on cold-water, temperate and tropical species, suggest the oxygen-dependence of upper thermal limits and the acute thermal sensitivity of the cardiorespiratory system increases with decreasing habitat temperature. Here we directly test this hypothesis by assessing the oxygen-dependence of CTMAX in the polar Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba), as well as the temperate Baltic prawn (Palaemon adspersus) and brown shrimp (Crangon crangon). We found that P. adspersus and C. crangon maintain CTMAX in progressive hypoxia down to 40 mmHg, and that only E. superba have oxygen-dependent upper thermal limits at normoxia. In E. superba, the observed decline in CTMAX with water PO2 is further supported by heart-rate measurements showing a plateauing, and subsequent decline and collapse of heart performance at CTMAX. Our results support the hypothesis that the oxygen-dependence of upper thermal limits in water-breathing ectotherms and the acute thermal sensitivity of their cardiorespiratory system increases with decreasing habitat temperature.

First, we focused on hot spots, i.e., locations where zooplankton occur in higher than regular abundance and/or operate at higher rates, We should be able to determine the processes leading to such aggregations and rates, and quantify their persistence. Second, information on the level of individual species, even of highly abundant ones, is limited, Concerted efforts should be undertaken with highly abundant to dominant species or genera (e.g., Oithona spp,, Calanus spp., Oikopleura spp., Euphausia superba) to determine what governs their abundance and its variability. Third, zooplankton clearly influence biogeochemical cycling in the ocean, but our knowledge of the underlying processes remains fragmentary. Therefore a thorough assessment of variables that still need to be quantified is required to obtain an understanding of zooplankton contributions to biogeochemical cycling. Combining studies on the 7 issues from MZC1 with the 3 from MZC2 should eventually lead to a comprehensive understanding of (1) the mechanisms governing the abundance and existence of dominant zooplankton taxa, and (2) the control of biodiversity and biocomplexity, for example, in the tropical ocean where diversity is high. These recommendations come from an assemblage of chemical, physical and biological oceanographers with experience in major interdisciplinary studies, including modeling. These recommendations are intended to stimulate efforts within the oceanographic community to facilitate the development of predictive capabilities for major biological processes in the ocean.

The enzyme activities of Acartia clausi, Centropages typicus, Corycaeus anglicus, Paracalanus parvus, and Ternora longicornis showed distinct species specific activity patterns, but also high intra-specific variability. Protein, lipids, carbon and nitrogen (C, N) were determined with micro-scale assays in individual copepods or in batches of 10 to 50 animals. Water soluble protein contents ranged from 16% to 38%, and lipid contents from 2.4% to 5.5% of dry mass. The molar C/N ratios were between 4.1 and 4.5. The presented microassays provide suitable tools for studying physiological reactions of copepods and other small pelagic crustaceans in response to variable environmental conditions.

J	Kinjo, A; Koito, T; Kawaguchi, S; Inoue, K				Kinjo, Azusa; Koito, Tomoko; Kawaguchi, So; Inoue, Koji			Evolutionary History of the GABA Transporter (GAT) Group Revealed by Marine Invertebrate GAT-1	PLOS ONE												The GABA transporter (GAT) group is one of the major subgroups in the solute career 6 (SLC6) family of transmembrane proteins. The GAT group, which has been well studied in mammals, has 6 known members, i.e., a taurine transporter (TAUT), four GABA transporters (GAT-1, -2, -3, -4), and a creatine transporter (CT1), which have important roles in maintaining physiological homeostasis. However, the GAT group has not been extensively investigated in invertebrates; only TAUT has been reported in marine invertebrates such as bivalves and krills, and GAT-1 has been reported in several insect species and nematodes. Thus, it is unknown how transporters in the GAT group arose during the course of animal evolution. In this study, we cloned GAT-1 cDNAs from the deep-sea mussel, Bathymodiolus septemdierum, and the Antarctic krill, Euphausia superba, whose TAUT cDNA has already been cloned. To understand the evolutionary history of the GAT group, we conducted phylogenetic and synteny analyses on the GAT group transporters of vertebrates and invertebrates. Our findings suggest that transporters of the GAT group evolved through the following processes. First, GAT-1 and CT1 arose by tandem duplication of an ancestral transporter gene before the divergence of Deuterostomia and Protostomia; next, the TAUT gene arose and GAT-3 was formed by the tandem duplication of the TAUT gene; and finally, GAT-2 and GAT-4 evolved from a GAT-3 gene by chromosomal duplication in the ancestral vertebrates. Based on synteny and phylogenetic evidence, the present naming of the GAT group members does not accurately reflect the evolutionary relationships.

The relationship between coastal weather and foraging behaviour of chinstrap penguins, Pygoscelis antarctica	ICES JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE												There is increasing interest in using higher-trophic level predators as ecosystem indicators because their performance is presumed to be linked to the overall function of the ecosystem that supports them. In the southwest Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean, Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) supports huge predator populations as well as a growing commercial fishery. To utilize information from the ecosystem in an adaptive framework for sustainably managing krill catch levels, performance indices of krill predators have been proposed as a proxy for krill abundance. However, there are several potentially confounding sources of variability that might impact predator performance such as the effects of environmental variability and fishing pressure on krill availability at scales relevant to predators. In this context, our study capitalises on the occurrence of an unexpected El Nino event to characterise how environmental variability can drive changes in predator foraging behaviour. We demonstrate a clear link between coastal downwelling and changes in the at-sea habitat usage of chinstrap penguins (Pygoscelis antarctica) foraging in a local krill fishing area. Penguins tracked from their breeding colonies on Powell Island, Antarctic Peninsula, undertook fewer, longer foraging trips during the downwelling-affected season compared with the season where no such downwelling was detected, suggesting that changes in climate-driven oceanography may have reduced krill availability along the northern shelf of the island. Our study demonstrates that penguin foraging behaviour is modified by scale-dependent processes, which if not accounted for may result in erroneous conclusions being drawn when using penguins as bioindicators of krill abundance.

Distribution, population structure and trophodynamics of Southern Ocean Gymnoscopelus (Myctophidae) in the Scotia Sea	POLAR BIOLOGY												Gymnoscopelus braueri, Gymnoscopelus fraseri and Gymnoscopelus nicholsi are common in the Southern Ocean mesopelagic fish community. However, their ecology is poorly understood in the region. This study investigated spatial and temporal patterns in their abundance, population structure and diets at different times of year within the Scotia Sea to ascertain their functional role in the pelagic food web. G. braueri was the most abundant species (0.07-0.17 ind. 1,000 m(-3)) throughout the Scotia Sea. G. fraseri was absent from the sea-ice sectors and occurred mostly around the Antarctic Polar Front (APF), comprising densities of 0.01-0.04 ind. 1,000 m(-3). G. nicholsi occurred in low abundance (< 0.01 ind. 1,000 m(-3)) throughout the region. G. braueri and G. fraseri had a lifespan of 4 and 3 years, respectively, but spatial variation in their population structures was evident and recruitment appeared to occur only around the APF. G. nicholsi had a lifespan of > 4 years. There was evidence of seasonal variation in depth distribution, size-related sexual dimorphism and vertical segregation in size classes for each species. Overall, diets were dominated by copepods (Metridia spp., Rhincalanus gigas, Pleuromamma robusta) and euphausiids (Thysanoessa spp. and Euphausia superba), although G. fraseri did not predate E. superba. Regional, seasonal and ontogenetic patterns in diet were evident for all species. This study provides new insight into the ecology of these Gymnoscopelus species in the Scotia Sea. Such details contribute towards resolving how pelagic food webs are structured in the Southern Ocean and their sensitivity to ongoing environmental change.				, Martin/ABE-6728-2020; Collins, Martin A/J-8560-2017	Stowasser, Gabriele/0000-0002-0595-0772												0722-4060	1432-2056				MAR	2015	38	3					287	308		10.1007/s00300-014-1584-9							WOS:000350040500002						
J	Suzuki, H; Sasaki, H; Fukuchi, M				Suzuki, H; Sasaki, H; Fukuchi, M			Loss processes of sinking fecal pellets of zooplankton in the mesopelagic layers of the antarctic marginal ice zone	JOURNAL OF OCEANOGRAPHY												A time-series sediment trap deployment was carried out in the marginal ice zone (MIZ) of the Antarctic Ocean (64degrees42' S, 139-58' E; sea depth of 2930 m), during the austral summer. Cylindrical fecal pellets were the predominant sinking particles at 537 in in the middle of January and most of them disappeared below that depth, the loss of which were 25.3 mg C m(-2) day(-1) in the depth range of 537-796 m. Small-sized sinking particles other than fecal pellets increased in that depth range. Analyses of fecal pellets for remnant DNA corresponding to 16S mitochondrial RNA and 28S ribosomal RNA suggested that the large cylindrical fecal pellets at 537 in were produced by Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) and copepods. According to the presence of the DNA associated with sinking particles, E. superba fecal pellets rapidly disappeared below 537 in, while copepod fecal pellets still remained in the mesopelagic and bathypelagic layers. Small-sized amorphous sinking particles at 537 in also contained E. superba- and copepod-derived DNA. The abundance of trap-collected copepods (Oithona spp. and Oncaea spp.) which are known to be coprophagous increased at 796 in where many fecal pellets disappeared. We suggest that those rapidly sinking pellets were fragmented by copepods with intensified coprorhexy activity (fragmentation of fecal pellets) in the mesopelagic layers, reducing their sinking rates. These smaller and slower sinking particles can be important food sources for detritivorus or coprophagous animals in mesopelagic and bathypelagic layers in the MIZ.																	0916-8370					DEC	2003	59	6					809	818		10.1023/B:JOCE.0000009572.08048.0d							WOS:000186403900005						
J	Reid, K; Croxall, JP; Briggs, DR; Murphy, EJ				Reid, K; Croxall, JP; Briggs, DR; Murphy, EJ			Antarctic ecosystem monitoring: quantifying the response of ecosystem indicators to variability in Antarctic krill.	ICES JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE					Symposium on Quantitative Ecosystem Indicators for Fisheries Management	MAR 31-APR 03, 2004	UNESCO, Intergovernmental Oceanog Commiss, Paris, FRANCE	Sci Comm Ocean Res	UNESCO, Intergovernmental Oceanog Commiss			The utility of upper-trophic-level species as ecosystem indicators is determined by our ability to relate changes in indices of their performance to changes at lower trophic levels. Such relationships were assessed using indices of predator performance (response vectors) for four predator species, together with independent ship-based acoustic estimates of abundance of their main prey, Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba), from South Georgia in the South Atlantic Ocean. Out of 32 response vectors investigated, 13 showed a significant non-linear relationship, based on a Holling Type II response, to krill abundance, and just five showed a significant linear relationship. Predator responses reflecting the processes during summer, when prey surveys were undertaken, showed the closest relationship with prey abundance. Distinct relationships existed between the variability of indices and the biological processes they measured. Body mass variables had the lowest variability (CVs < 10%), whereas those measuring breeding success showed the greatest variability (CVs > 50%). Multivariate indices, produced by combining response vectors from all four predator species into a single combined index, provided a better fit with krill data than any of the individual vectors. Whereas population size parameters for individual species showed no relationship with annual estimates of krill abundance, a combined, multispecies population size index did show a significant response. Understanding the form of the relationship between concurrent indicators of prey abundance and key ecosystem metrics/reference points, such as population size, is crucial to the application of monitoring data to management action.

Main prey items were krill Euphausia superba, the amphipod hyperiid Themisto gaudichaudii, mysids (primarily Antarctomysis maxima), and in 1985 also Thysanoessa species. The proportion of krill and T gaudichaudii in the diet varied considerably among the 3 years, whereas the proportion of mysids in the diet remained fairly constant, Krill appears to be the preferred food. In years of krill shortage, such as in 1991, krill was replaced by T gaudichaudii. The occurrence of krill in the diet in 1991 was among the lowest within a 28 yr period of investigation. Variation in food composition among sampling sites was high. This high variation appears to be primarily associated with differences in prey availability, but much less with prey size selectivity. Feeding intensity varied considerably among seasons. It was highest in 1992. The proportion of empty stomachs was uncommonly high and stomach content weight was uncommonly low in January 1991, a period when energy-rich food was needed for the final maturation of gonads. At the same time, an unusually high proportion of sexually mature fish showed no signs of the gonad development necessary for spawning in that season. It was hypothesized that as in some other non-Antarctic fish species the shortage of suitable food may have forced the fish to sacrifice gonad maturation in order to maintain body size.																	0171-8630					MAY	1994	108	1-2					43	57		10.3354/meps108043							WOS:A1994NN70000005						
J	Plaganyi, EE; Butterworth, DS				Plaganyi, Eva E.; Butterworth, Doug S.			The Scotia Sea krill fishery and its possible impacts on dependent predators: modeling localized depletion of prey	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS												The nature and impact of fishing on predators that share a fished resource is an important consideration in ecosystem-based fisheries management. Krill (Euphausia superba) is a keystone species in the Antarctic, serving as a fundamental forage source for predators and simultaneously being subject to fishing. We developed a spatial multispecies operating model (SMOM) of krill-predator fishery dynamics to help advise on allocation of the total krill catch among 15 small-scale management units (SSMUs) in the Scotia Sea, with a goal to reduce the potential impact of fishing on krill predators. The operating model describes the underlying population dynamics and is used in simulations to compare different management options for adjusting fishing activities (e.g., a different spatial distribution of catches). The numerous uncertainties regarding the choice of parameter values pose a major impediment to constructing reliable ecosystem models. The pragmatic solution proposed here involves the use of operating models that are composed of alternative combinations of parameters that essentially try to bound the uncertainty in, for example, the choice of survival rate estimates as well as the functional relationships between predators and prey. Despite the large uncertainties, it is possible to discriminate the ecosystem impacts of different spatial fishing allocations. The spatial structure of the model is fundamental to addressing concerns of localized depletion of prey in the vicinity of land-based predator breeding colonies. Results of the model have been considered in recent management deliberations for spatial allocations of krill catches in the Scotia Sea and their associated impacts on dependent predator species.

Movements and dive behaviour of two leopard seals (Hydrurga leptonyx) off Queen Maud Land, Antarctica	POLAR BIOLOGY												Two adult female leopard seals (Hydrurga leptonyx) were tagged with satellite-linked dive recorders off Queen Maud Land, Antarctica, just after moulting in mid-February. The transmitters transmitted for 80 and 220 days, respectively. Both seals remained within the pack ice relatively close to the Antarctic Continent until early May, when contact was lost with one seal. The one remaining seal then migrated north, to the east side of the South Sandwich Islands in 3 weeks, whereafter it headed east, until contact was lost at 55A degrees S in early September. From mid-May to late September this animal always stayed close to the edge of the pack ice. Both seals made mostly short (< 5 min) dives to depths of 10-50 m and only occasionally dove deeper than 200 m, the deepest dive recorded being 304 m. A nocturnal diving pattern was evident in autumn and early winter, while day-time diving prevailed in mid-winter. Haul out probability was highest at mid-day (about 40% in late February and more than 80% in March and April). From May till September the remaining animal mainly stayed at sea, in the vicinity of the pack ice, with only occasional haul outs. These data suggest that a portion of the adult leopard seals may spend the winter mainly in open water, off the edge of the pack ice, where they primarily hunt near the surface. In that case, it is likely that krill (Euphausia superba), as well as penguins, young crabeater seals (Lobodon carcinophaga) and a variety of fish are important prey items.																	0722-4060	1432-2056				FEB	2009	32	2					263	270		10.1007/s00300-008-0527-8							WOS:000262439300014						
J	Ainley, DG; Pauly, D				Ainley, David G.; Pauly, Daniel			Fishing down the food web of the Antarctic continental shelf and slope	POLAR RECORD												The history of biotic exploitation for the continental margin (shelf and slope) of the Antarctic Large Marine Ecosystem (LME) is reviewed, with emphasis on the period from 1970 to 2010. In the Antarctic Peninsula portion, marine mammals were decimated by the 1970s and groundfish by the early 1980s. Fishing for Antarctic krill Euphausia superba began upon the demise of groundfish and now is the only fishing that remains in this region. Surveys show that cetacean and most groundfish stocks remain severely depressed, harvest of which is now prohibited by the International Whaling Commission and the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR). On the other hand, krill fishing in this region is underway and in recent years has contributed up to 72% of the Southern Ocean catch, depending on fishing conditions and the CCAMLR conservation measures in force. Elsewhere along the Antarctic continental margin, marine mammals were also severely depleted by the 1970s, followed directly by relatively low-level fisheries for krill that continued until the early 1990s. Recently in these areas, where fin-fishing is still allowed, fisheries for Antarctic toothfish Dissostichus mawsoni have been initiated, with one of this fish's main prey, grenadiers Macrourus spp., being taken significantly as by-catch. Continental margin fishing currently accounts for similar to 25% of the total toothfish catch of the Southern Ocean. Fishing along the Antarctic continental margin, especially the Antarctic Peninsula region, is a clear case of both the tragedy of the commons and fishing down the food web'.

J	Klein, ES; Watters, GM				Klein, Emily S.; Watters, George M.			What's the catch? Profiling the benefits and costs associated with marine protected areas and displaced fishing in the Scotia Sea	PLOS ONE												Both costs and benefits must be considered when implementing marine protected areas (MPAs), particularly those associated with fishing effort displaced by potential closures. The Southern Ocean offers a case study in understanding such tradeoffs, where MPAs are actively being discussed to achieve a range of protection and sustainable use objectives. Here, we evaluated the possible impacts of two MPA scenarios on the Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) fishery and krill-dependent predators in the Scotia Sea, explicitly addressing the displacement of fishing from closed areas. For both scenarios, we employed a minimally realistic, spatially explicit ecosystem model and considered three alternative redistributions of displaced fishing. We projected both MPAs to provide positive outcomes for many krill-dependent predators, especially when closed areas included at least 50-75% of their foraging distributions. Further, differences between the scenarios suggest ways to improve seal and penguin protection in the Scotia Sea. MPA scenarios also projected increases in total fishery yields, but alongside risks of fishing in areas where relatively low krill densities could cause the fishery to suspend operations. The three alternatives for redistributing displaced fishing had little effect on benefits to predators, but did matter for the fishery, with greater differences in overall catch and risk of fishing in areas of low krill density when displaced fishing was redistributed evenly among the open areas. Collectively, results suggest a well-designed MPA in the Scotia Sea may protect krill-dependent predators, even with displaced fishing, and preclude further spatial management of the krill fishery outside the MPA. More broadly, outcomes denote the importance of delineating fishing and predator habitat, spatial scales, and the critical trade-offs inherent in MPA development.

C. wilsoni has been exploited on a commercial scale from the late 1970s to the end of the 1980s off Joinville-D'Urville Islands (CCAMLR Statistical Sub-area 48.1) and in the Cosmonauts and Cooperation Seas and Prydz Bay in the Indian Ocean sector (CCAMLR Statistical Division 58.4.2). This paper presents new information on biological features and life history characteristics of C. wilsoni, based on research survey collections along the northern Antarctic Peninsula in 2006 and 2007 and samples taken in the commercial fishery in 1987. Length frequency compositions from the research surveys demonstrated that fish 21-34 cm long predominated in the catches. Sexual maturity is attained at 24-25 cm. Absolute fecundity and relative fecundity is low (1,000-2,500 eggs; 6-12 eggs). Oocyte diameter varied from 4.0 to 4.9 mm very close to spawning. Spawning at the tip of the Antarctic Peninsula is likely to occur in October-November. Remotely operated vehicle deployments in the northern Weddell Sea demonstrated that C. wilsoni exhibit parental nest guarding where males protect the eggs. The incubation period is likely to be 8 months long. Fish feed primarily on Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) in the Antarctic Peninsula region and in the Cosmonauts and Cooperation Seas while fish take ice krill (Euphausia crystallorophias), Pleuragramma antarcticum and myctophids to some extent in other areas. Age determination still awaits validation. Preliminary ageing attempts suggested a maximum age of about 8-10 years.																	0722-4060					FEB	2008	31	3					381	393		10.1007/s00300-007-0366-z							WOS:000252193100013

Differing foraging strategies influence mercury (Hg) exposure in an Antarctic penguin community	ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION												Seabirds are ideal model organisms to track mercury (Hg) through marine food webs as they are long-lived, broadly distributed, and are susceptible to biomagnification due to foraging at relatively high trophic levels. However, using these species as biomonitors requires a solid understanding of the degree of species, sexual and age-specific variation in foraging behaviors which act to mediate their dietary exposure to Hg. We combined stomach content analysis along with Hg and stable isotope analyses of blood, feathers and common prey items to help explain inter and intra-specific patterns of dietary Hg exposure across three sympatric Pygoscelis penguin species commonly used as biomonitors of Hg availability in the Antarctic marine ecosystem. We found that penguin tissue Hg concentrations differed across species, between adults and juveniles, but not between sexes. While all three penguins species diets were dominated by Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) and to a lesser extent fish, stable isotope based proxies of relative trophic level and krill consumption could not by itself sufficiently explain the observed patterns of inter and intra-specific variation in Hg. However, integrating isotopic approaches with stomach content analysis allowed us to identify the relatively higher risk of Hg exposure for penguins foraging on mesopelagic prey relative to congeners targeting epipelagic or benthic prey species. When possible, future seabird biomonitoring studies should seek to combine isotopic approaches with other, independent measures of foraging behavior to better account for the confounding effects of inter and intra-specific variation on dietary Hg exposure.

J	Nakano, S; Yoshinuma, T; Yamada, T				Nakano, Shigeru; Yoshinuma, Toshio; Yamada, Toshihiro			Reactivity of shrimp allergy-related IgE antibodies to krill tropomyosin	INTERNATIONAL ARCHIVES OF ALLERGY AND IMMUNOLOGY												Background: Krill, which morphologically resembles small shrimp, represents small ocean crustaceans and has been used for human consumption in Japan and some other countries. The major allergen in crustaceans has been reported to be tropomyosin, but the allergenicity of krill tropomyosin remains uncertain. Methods: Amino acid sequences of tropomyosin in two species of krill (Euphausia superba and E. pacifica) were deduced. Recombinant krill tropomyosins were produced in Escherichia coli using a pCold IV vector system, and the cross-reactivity of shrimp allergy-related IgE to the recombinant tropomyosins and several animal protein extracts was assessed by immunoblotting. Results: The deduced amino acid sequences of the E. superba and E. pacifica tropomyosins (designated as Eup s 1 and Eup p 1, respectively) were 284 residues and showed significant homology to those of shrimp, lobster and crab tropomyosins. Shrimp allergy-related IgE reacted to approximately 38-kDa protein bands in krill (E. superba), shrimp, lobster and crab protein extracts but did not react to protein extracts from either mollusks or vertebrates. Furthermore, the IgE recognized rEup s 1 and rEup p 1 as 38-kDa protein bands, and absorption of the IgE with rEup s 1 removed IgE reactivity to recombinant tropomyosins and protein extracts from krill and shrimp. Conclusions: Krill tropomyosins included highly homologous sequences to previously reported IgE-binding epitopes in Pen a 1 (tropomyosin of Penaeus aztecus). The cross-reactivity in shrimp allergy-related IgE binding among krill, shrimp, lobster and crab tropomyosins was revealed. These observations suggest the potential allergenicity of krill tropomyosin. Copyright (c) 2007 S.

Given the fact that the xenobiotics detected in polar ecosystems are persistent and toxic, investigating the presence of these chemicals in a pristine environment such as Antarctica has become a priority. In specimens of the most important key species of Antarctic marine food web, Euphausia superba and Pleuragramma antarcticum sampled in the Ross Sea, we evaluated concentrations of the following persistent organic pollutants: polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), chlorinated pesticides such as hexachlorobenzene (HCB), and p,p'-DDE. Sampling was carried out in the framework of the Italian National Program for Research in Antarctica (PNRA) from 1999 to 2000. PCB concentrations were higher than HCB and p,p'-DDE by two orders of magnitude; levels of HCB and p,p'-DDE, in the range of 1-5 ng/g wet weight, were low compared to those reported for species in lower latitude marine environments. PCBs values were comparable to those determined in moderately contaminated areas. PCB fingerprints and patterns of isomer classes showed a predominance of low-chlorinated PCBs: tri-, tetra- and penta-CB congeners constituted more than 50% of the total residue in krill and larvae and less than 50% in adult silverfish. The pattern seems common to that of Kanechlor, a technical mixture used mostly in Japan and other Eastern Asian countries that are roughly at the same longitude of the Ross Sea.

J	Croll, DA; Tershy, BR				Croll, DA; Tershy, BR			Penguins, fur seals, and fishing: prey requirements and potential competition in the South Shetland Islands, Antarctica	POLAR BIOLOGY												Antarctic and sub-Antarctic seabirds, marine mammals, and human fisheries concentrate their foraging efforts on a single species, Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba). Because these predators may have a significant effect on krill abundance, we estimated the energy and prey requirements of Adelie (Pygoscelis adeliae), chinstrap (Pygoscelis antarctica), and gentoo (Pygoscelis papua) penguins and female Antarctic fur seals (Arctocephalus gazella) breeding on the South Shetland Islands, Antarctica and compared these estimates with catch statistics from the Antarctic krill fishery. Published data on field metabolic rate, population size, diet, prey energy content, and metabolic efficiency were used to estimate prey requirements of these breeding, adult, land-based predators and their dependent offspring. Due to their large population size, chinstrap penguins were the most significant krill predators during the period examined, consuming an estimated 7.8 x 10(8) kg krill, followed by Adelie penguins (3.1 x 10(7) kg), gentoo penguins (1.2 x 10(7) kg), and Antarctic fur seals (3.6 x 10(6) kg). Total consumption of all land-based predators on the South Shetland Islands was estimated at 8.3 x 10(8) kg krill. The commercial krill fishery harvest in the South Shetland Island region (1.0 x 10(8) kg) was approximately 12% of this. Commercial harvest coincides seasonally and spatially with peak penguin and fur seal prey demands, and may affect prey availability to penguins and fur seals. This differs from the conclusions of Ichii et al. who asserted that the potential for competition between South Shetland predators and the commercial krill fishery is low.																	0722-4060					JUN	1998	19	6					365	374		10.1007/s003000050261							WOS:000073931800001						
J	Reid, K; Arnould, JPY				Reid, K; Arnould, JPY			The diet of Antarctic fur seals Arctocephalus gazella during the breeding season at South Georgia	POLAR BIOLOGY												The diet of lactating female Antarctic fur seals Arctocephalus gazella at South Georgia was investigated during the pub-rearing period (January/March) of 1991-1994. Antarctic krill Euphausia superba was the main prey item, occurring in 88% of all seats (n = 497), whereas fish occurred in 47% and squid in 5% of all seats. There was considerable intra- and inter-annual variation in the characteristics of krill taken by fur seals. The distribution of krill sizes taken suggests that fur seals are not actively selecting particular sizes of krill and, therefore, that the krill in the diet reflects the krill available around South Georgia. The absence of group 3 krill (44-48 mm in length) in the South Georgia area, as indicated by their absence in the diet of seals, is suggested as a possible reason for low availability of krill and the subsequent reproductive failure among krill predators. The frequency of occurrence of fish was much higher than in previous studies; the pattern of fish consumption showed a consistent seasonal pattern in 3 of the 4 years studied. Of the total number of the myctophid Protomyctophum choriodon, the most numerous fish taxon, 98% were taken between early February and the middle of March. Champsocephalus gunnari and Lepidonotothen larseni agg., which both feed on krill, dominated the fish component of the diet outside this period and together constituted 94% of the total estimated biomass of fish consumed. The intra- and inter-annual variability in the diet of Antarctic fur seals emphasise the need for diet studies to be conducted during the entire pup-rearing periods of several years.																	0722-4060					FEB	1996	16	2					105	114		10.1007/BF02390431							WOS:A1996TR75400005						
J	VORONINA, NM				VORONINA, NM			EUPHAUSIID LARVAE IN THE SOUTHERN PART OF THE PACIFIC SECTOR OF ANTARCTIC IN FEBRUARY - MARCH, 1992	OKEANOLOGIYA												The material was collected on the latitudinal section that crossed the Pacific sector of the Antarctic in its very middle (67 degrees S) and in the area north-eastwards of the Balleni Islands. In February - March, 1992, during the VI cruise of the R/V ''Akademic Ioffe'' under the WOCE program. Four water modifications were studied: low latitude (Antarctic Circumpolar Current), high latitude (Coastal Antarctic Current), mixed and shelf waters. Plankton was collected with the 170 mu-mesh Juday closing nets at depths down to 1500 m or to the bottom. Larvae of 2 euphausiid species were found: Euphausia superba and Thysanoessa macrura. The first one was discovered only in the south-western part of the study region and was relatively abundant (>500 specimens/m(2)) only on two near-shore stations. T. macrura larvae were found everywhere, yet being limited vertically by the 0 - 200 m layer. Their average numbers were 36 +/- 13 spec/m(2) and, despite the previous data, they did not differ in different water modifications. The reasons are discussed. Three T. macrura local maxima occurred on the crossing frontal zones and in the vicinity of the intensive upwelling. The data of the stations show that postlarval development of T. macrura can be completed during the first period of growth only in a part of the region investigated. The quantitative distribution of euphausiids is discussed based on the obtained data and the available publications. The idea is disputed of the existence in the Pacific sector of Antarctic south of the ice northern boundary of a independent ecosystem characterized by abundance of this group and its domination in the community.																	0030-1574					SEP-OCT	1995	35	5					725	732									WOS:A1995TF08200012

The seasonal cycle of the Lazarev Sea macrozooplankton community and a potential shift to top-down trophic control in winter	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY												Between 2004 and 2008, during the German Southern Ocean GLOBEC programme, four large scale bio-oceanographic surveys were conducted in the Lazarev Sea for the Lazarev Sea Krill Survey (LAKRIS). These surveys were completed in Autumn (April-May) 2004, Summer (December-January) 2005/06, Winter (July-August) 2006, and Summer (December-January) 2007/08. On each occasion macrozooplankton communities were sampled by RMT-8 in the upper 200 m of the water column. Chlorophyll a biomass averaged similar to 1.5 mg m(-3) (max=8.2 mg m(-3)) in Summer 05/06, 0.88 mg m(-3) (max=2.77 mg m(-3)) in Summer 07/08, 0.24 mg m(-3) (max=0.73 mg m(-3)) in Autumn 04, and 0.042 mg m(-3) (max= 0.1 mg m(-3)) in Winter 06. Macrozooplankton densities did not differ significantly between seasons and were 53, 68, 59, and 48 ind. 1000 m(-3) in Summer 05/06, Summer 07/08, Autumn, and Winter, respectively. Total macrozooplankton biomass, however, increased significantly from summer (0.88 and 0.97 g dry weight 1000 m(-3) in Summer 05/06 and Summer 07/08, respectively) to Autumn 04 (2.66 g dry weight 1000 m(-3)) and Winter 06 levels (1.75 g dry weight 1000 m(-3)). This biomass increase was due to both an increased occurrence of Euphausia superba and fish and a shift to a larger size structure in the latter group. Siphonophores (predominantly Diphyes antarctica), chaetognaths (predominantly Eukrohnia hamata and Sagitta gazellae) and euphausiids (predominantly Thysanoessa macrura and E. superba) contributed >80% to total densities in all four surveys. However, a strong and distinctive change in assemblage structure was observed between seasons. Key amongst these was a shift within the euphausiids from a dominance of T. macrura in summer to that of E. superba in autumn and winter; a winter decrease in E. hamata; an autumn and winter decrease in Tomopteris sp.; and a winter increase in the abundance of the grazers Clio pyramidata sulcata and Ihlea racovitzai, hyperiids, and the myctophid fish Electrona antarctica. Carnivorous macrozooplankton formed the major trophic group in all seasons, contributing 44-60% to total macrozooplankton abundance and 39-58% to total macrozooplankton biomass in all four surveys. The combined predation pressure of carnivores and potential increased winter carnivory by E. superba and other omnivorous species, was expected to be high. In view of low winter primary production, we suggest that the epipelagic food web of the Lazarev Sea shifted from being bottom-up controlled in summer to top-down controlled in winter.

Krill oil supplementation increases plasma concentrations of eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic acids in overweight and obese men and women	NUTRITION RESEARCH												Antarctic krill, also known as Euphausia superba, is a marine crustacean rich in both eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). We tested the hypothesis that krill Oil Would increase plasma concentrations of EPA and DHA without adversely affecting indicators of safety, tolerability, or selected metabolic parameters. In this randomized, double-blind parallel arm trial, overweight and obese men and women (N = 76) were randomly assigned to receive double-blind Capsules containing 2 g/d of krill oil, menhaden oil, or control (olive) oil for 4 weeks. Results showed that plasma EPA and DHA concentrations increased significantly more (P < .001) in the krill oil (178.4 +/- 38.7 and 90.2 +/- 40.3 mu mol/L, respectively) and menhaden oil (131.8 +/- 28.0 and 149.9 +/- 30.4 mu mol/L, respectively) groups than in the control group (2.9 +/- 13.8 and -1.1 +/- 32.4 mu mol/L, respectively). Systolic blood pressure declined significantly more (P < .05) in the menhaden oil (-2.2 +/- 2.0 min Hg) group than in the control group (3.3 +/- 1.5 mm Hg), and the response in the krill oil group (-0.8 +/- 1.4 mm Hg) did not differ from the other 2 treatments. Blood urea nitrogen declined in the krill oil group as compared with the menhaden oil group (P < .006). No significant differences for other safety variables were noted, including adverse events. In conclusion, 4 weeks of krill oil supplementation increased plasma EPA and DHA and was well tolerated, with no indication of adverse effects on safety parameters. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

J	Hosie, GW; Schultz, MB; Kitchener, JA; Cochran, TG; Richards, K				Hosie, GW; Schultz, MB; Kitchener, JA; Cochran, TG; Richards, K			Macrozooplankton community structure off East Antarctica (80-150 degrees E) during the Austral summer of 1995/1996	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY												Zooplankton data from routine 0-200 m oblique trawls and targeted trawls were analysed using cluster analysis and non-metric multidimensional scaling to define the communities in Eastern Antarctica (80-150 degrees E), their distribution patterns, indicator species, and species affinities. Three communities were defined based on routine trawls. The Main Oceanic Community comprising herbivorous copepods, chaetognaths, and the euphausiid Thysanoessa macrura dominated the area west of 120 degrees E. The area east of 120 degrees E was dominated by Salpa thompsoni. The third community located in the neritic zone was dominated by Euphausia crystallorophias. Antarctic krill Euphausia superba did not form a distinct community in its own right, unlike previous observations in Prydz Bay. Krill were distributed throughout most of the survey area but generally in higher abundances towards the shelf break. Overall, krill abundance was low compared with previous net surveys in Prydz Bay. Three main types of assemblages were identified based on target trawls. The first group was dominated by krill (mean 1149 individuals per 1000 m(3)) which represented > 99% of Group 1 catches in terms of numbers and biomass. Group 2 comprised the bulk of target trawls and comprised a wide diversity of species typical of the main oceanic community, with a mean abundance approximately half of that observed in the routine trawls. The third group comprised trawls in the neritic zone dominated by E. crystallorophias. No salp-dominated aggregation was found. While E. superba did not dominate a distinct community geographically as seen in previous Prydz Bay surveys, it did dominate discrete layers or aggregations, showing that both horizontal and vertical separation of communities exist.

J	Nevitt, G; Reid, K; Trathan, P				Nevitt, G; Reid, K; Trathan, P			Testing olfactory foraging strategies in an Antarctic seabird assemblage	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY												Procellariiform seabirds (petrels, albatrosses and shearwaters) forage over thousands of square kilometres for patchily distributed prey resources. While these birds are known for their large olfactory bulbs and excellent sense of smell, how they use odour cues to locate prey patches in the vast ocean is not well understood. Here, we investigate species-specific responses to 3-methyl pyrazine in a sub-Antarctic species assemblage near South Georgia Island (54degrees00' S, 36degrees00' W). Pyrazines are scented compounds found in macerated Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba), a primary prey item for many seabird species in this region. To examine behavioural attraction to this odour, we presented birds with either scented or 'unscented' vegetable oil slicks at sea. As a positive control for our experiments, we also compared birds' responses to a general olfactory attractant, herring oil. Responses to pyrazine were both highly species specific and consistent with results from earlier studies investigating responses to crude krill extracts. For example, Cape petrels (Daption capense), giant petrels (Macronectes sp.) and white-chinned petrels (Procellaria aequinoctialis) were sighted at least 1.8-4 times as often at pyrazine-scented slicks than at control slicks. Black-browed albatrosses (Diomedea melanophris) were only sighted at pyrazine-scented slicks and never at control slicks. Wilson's storm-petrels (Oceanites oceanicus), black-bellied storm-petrels(Fregetta tropica), great shearwaters (Puffinus gravis) and prions (Pachyptila sp.) were sighted with equal frequency at control and pyrazine-scented slicks. As expected, responses to herring oil were more common. With the exception of great shearwaters (Puffinus gravis), each of these species was sighted up to five times as often at slicks scented with herring oil compared with control slicks. Together, the results support the hypothesis that Antarctic procellariiforms use species-specific foraging strategies that are inter-dependent and more complex than simply tracking prey by scent.																	0022-0949	1477-9145				SEP	2004	207	20					3537	3544		10.1242/jeb.01198							WOS:000224694300015	15339950

DNA-based diet analysis of mesopelagic fish from the southern Kerguelen Axis	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY												Mesopelagic fish form an important link between zooplankton and higher trophic levels in Southern Ocean food webs, however their diets are poorly known. Most of the dietary information available comes from morphological analysis of stomach contents and to a lesser extent fatty acid and stable isotopes. DNA sequencing could substantially improve our knowledge of mesopelagic fish diets, but has not previously been applied. We used high-throughput DNA sequencing (HTS) of the 18S ribosomal DNA and mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I (COI) to characterise stomach contents of four myctophid and one bathylagid species collected at the southern extension of the Kerguelen Plateau (southern Kerguelen Axis), one of the most productive regions in the Indian sector of the Southern Ocean. Diets of the four myctophid species were dominated by amphipods, euphausiids and copepods, whereas radiolarians and siphonophores contributed a much greater proportion of HTS reads for Bathylagus sp. Analysis of mitochondrial COI showed that all species preyed on Thysanoessa macrura, but Euphausia superba was only detected in the stomach contents of myctophids. Size-based shifts in diet were apparent, with larger individuals of both bathylagid and myctophid species more likely to consume euphausiids, but we found little evidence for regional differences in diet composition for each species over the survey area. The presence of DNA from coelenterates and other gelatinous prey in the stomach contents of all five species suggests the importance of these taxa in the diet of Southern Ocean mesopelagics has been underestimated to date. Our study demonstrates the use of DNA-based diet assessment to determine the role of mesopelagic fish and their trophic position in the Southern Ocean and inform the development of ecosystem models.

Predatory impact of the myctophid fish community on zooplankton in the Scotia Sea (Southern Ocean)	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												Myctophids are the most abundant mesopelagic fishes in the Southern Ocean, although their trophic role within the predominantly krill-based food web in regions south of the Antarctic Polar Front (APF) is poorly resolved. This study therefore examined the diets of 10 species of myctophid fishes: Electrona antarctica, E. carlsbergi, Gymnoscopelus braueri, G. fraseri, G. nicholsi, Krefftichthys anderssoni, Proto myctophum bolini, P. tenisoni, P. choriodon and Nannobrachium achirus, in the Scotia Sea, together with their predatory impact on the underlying zooplankton community. Myctophids and their prey were sampled in different seasons by scientific nets deployed across the Scotia Sea from the sea-ice zone to the APF. Based on the percentage index of relative importance, myctophids had high overlap in their diets, although the data indicate dietary specialisation in some species. There was also a distinct switch in diet, from copepods to euphausiids and amphipods, with increasing myctophid size. Myctophid predation impacted daily copepod production by between 0.01 and 5%, with Calanus simillimus being most impacted. Total annual consumption of copepods was around 1.5 million t (Mt) per year. All myctophids preyed upon the euphausiid Thysanoessa spp., consuming similar to 12% of its daily productivity and around 4 Mt per year. However, only larger myctophid species preyed upon Antarctic krill Euphausia superba, consuming 2% of its daily productivity, which could amount to as much as 17 Mt per year. Themisto gaudichaudii was also an important dietary component, with 4% of its daily productivity being consumed, amounting to around 2 Mt per year. This study demonstrates that myctophids link secondary productivity to higher predators both through krill-dependent and krill-independent trophic pathways.

Although, bulk acoustic data can provide information on the distribution patterns and dynamics of MTL organisms, it is necessary to convert acoustic-derived indices into biologically relevant quantities for parameterising and validating ecosystem and trophic models. A 7-year time series of acoustic data collected by ships of opportunity (SOOP) in the New Zealand sector of the Southern Ocean, information on species' distribution derived from trawl samples collected in research voyages, and target strength (TS) estimates obtained using a resonance-scattering model and literature TS-length relationships, were used to obtain the first estimates of density of mesopelagic fish in this region. Estimates of mesopelagic fish density decreased from north to south reflecting changes in species composition and scattering properties across three latitudinal regions (Northern, Central and Southern). Density estimates ranged from 16.4-40.1 in the north to 4.4-13.4 g m(-2) in the south. Catches revealed that the Northern region was dominated by Lampanyctodes hectoris and Protomyctophum sp. (Myctophidae) and Maurolicus australis (Sternoptychidae); the Central and Southern regions were dominated by the myctophids Electrona antarctica and Protomyctophum sp. and the Antarctic krill, Euphausia superba. Information on species composition was the main source of uncertainty in the density estimates, highlighting the need for more biological sampling. This study demonstrates that it is possible to integrate acoustic data collected opportunistically with auxiliary information from research voyages and literature to provide estimates of mesopelagic fish biomass in remote areas.					ladroit, Yoann/0000-0002-5723-9501												0722-4060	1432-2056				JAN	2020	43	1					43	61		10.1007/s00300-019-02611-3							WOS:000511739000004						
J	Santora, JA				Santora, Jarrod A.			Dynamic intra-seasonal habitat use by Antarctic fur seals suggests migratory hotspots near the Antarctic Peninsula	MARINE BIOLOGY												Antarctic fur seals (Arctocephalus gazella) are major secondary consumers in the Southern Ocean, placing them in potential competition with commercial fisheries and requiring research to understand their seasonal habitat use. Using the data obtained during 14 shipboard surveys sampled on a fixed grid (150 K km(2)) during mid- to late summer, I quantified the spatial distribution and intra-seasonal variability of fur seal sightings relative to distance to land and hydrographic boundaries. I test the hypothesis that fur seals display an increase in their at-sea abundance during mid- to late summer near the Antarctic Peninsula as they prepare to take up wintering grounds. I also test whether abundances of their potential prey, krill and myctophids, exhibit intra-seasonal variability. During midsummer, high-abundance areas are located near major breeding colonies; however, during late summer, there is an order-of-magnitude increase in fur seal abundance, coinciding with an increase in the number of high-abundance areas located in Bransfield Strait. Coincidently, abundance of Euphausia superba decreased and the myctophid Electrona antarctica increased between mid- and late-summer surveys. High-abundance areas of fur seals are not associated with the southern Antarctic Circumpolar Current front but are concentrated within 100 km from land, potentially indicating the location of haul out and important coastal habitat use areas. The dynamic increase in the number and location of high-abundance areas during late summer represents a considerable amount of mammalian predators entering the Antarctic Peninsula marine ecosystem. This information is important for understanding the seasonal impact of fur seals on regional marine food webs and their potential interaction with the autumn-winter krill fishery.																	0025-3162					JUN	2013	160	6					1383	1393		10.1007/s00227-013-2190-z							WOS:000319360100008

Long-term inter- and intraspecific dietary variation in sibling seabird species	MARINE BIOLOGY												Northern Macronectes halli and southern giant petrels M. giganteus are opportunistic predators and the dominant avian scavengers in sub-Antarctic and Antarctic ecosystems. At South Georgia, there are globally important breeding populations of both species; however, no detailed diet study has been carried out at this site for>35 years. Here, we analysed stomach contents of northern (n=81) and southern giant petrel (n=73) chicks at Bird Island, South Georgia (2014/15-2016/17). Specifically, we investigated: (1) interspecific and sexual dietary segregation; (2) diet changes within and among recent years; and (3) long-term diet changes since 1979/80-1980/81. Overall diet composition was similar between species, with penguins comprising approximately half the diet by mass. In both species (but more pronounced in southern giant petrels), prey delivered by female parents included higher proportions (by mass) of penguins and Antarctic krill Euphausia superba, and by male parents included more Antarctic fur seal Arctocephalus gazella carrion and seabirds other than penguins. Consumption of penguins increased, and of seal carrion declined, as chick-rearing progressed, mirroring the decreasing availability of the latter after the peak pupping period in December at South Georgia. Comparisons with data from 1979/80-1980/81 suggest some changes in giant petrel diets; however, these differences were no greater than the typical annual variation, and there were no clear links between diet and breeding allochrony or the differing population trends (more rapid increase in northern than southern giant petrels). The high diet diversity and ability of giant petrels to exploit both carrion and marine prey facilitates coexistence with other sympatric Procellariiformes and explains their favourable population status.

Effect of animal-borne camera and flash on the diving behaviour of the female Antarctic fur seal (Arctocephalus gazella)	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART I-OCEANOGRAPHIC RESEARCH PAPERS												Studies have documented effects of drag created by data-logging units attached to seals, but the effect of visual stimuli from such units has not been investigated. We evaluated potential effects of camera attachment including near-infrared flash operation by comparing the diving behaviour of 15 female Antarctic fur seals (Arctocephalus gazella) with cameras and 10 seals without cameras. Irrespective of the presence of the camera or flash, all seals exhibited an expected diel dive pattern with shallower, shorter dives, less time at the bottom of a dive, and slower ascent and descent rates at night following krill vertical migration. We also observed a previously unreported foraging trip dive pattern with faster ascents and descents near the end of trips. With cameras present, dive duration and bottom time increased and ascents were slower. During flash operation, dive duration increased and bottom time remained constant throughout the day contrary to the expected diel trend. Also during flash operation, bottom time was shorter at the beginning of a foraging trip and dives were deeper, with longer duration and bottom time later in the trip. We were unable to conclude whether the flash emission spectrum overlapped with the visual sensitivity of seals and Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) since visual sensitivity data for seals and krill at longer wavelengths were not available. It is possible that the flash was bright enough for the seals or krill to detect; however, although there was a change in diving behaviour observed during flash operation this behaviour was within the range of values normally observed for these seals and should not cause ethical concern.

Trophic ecology of Grey-headed albatrosses from Marion Island, Southern Ocean: insights from stomach contents and diet tracers	MARINE BIOLOGY												During chick-rearing, albatrosses can alternate between long foraging trips that provide the main source of food for the adults and short foraging trips that they use to feed their young. This flexibility in foraging behaviour can lead to differences in diet composition between adults and chicks and implies that they may be vulnerable in different ways to food shortages. The trophic ecology of the Grey-headed albatross Thalassarche chrysostoma was investigated at the sub-Antarctic Prince Edward Islands during the chick-rearing period in April 2006 using a combination of approaches. Diets of adults and chicks were assessed using stable isotope ratios and fatty acid (FA) profiles of blood and/or stomach oils, in addition to stomach contents analysis. Fish from the family Macrouridae and cephalopods (particularly the onychoteuthid Kondakovia longimana) were the primary prey, whereas crustaceans (krill Euphausia superba) represented a smaller proportion of the stomach contents. Stomach oil FA profiles contained more monounsaturated FA than the profiles of plasma, which were richer in saturated FA and arachidonic acid (20:4n-6). There was also a distinct separation of adults from chicks, with higher levels of monounsaturates in chick plasma, and higher saturated FA levels (particularly 16:0) in the adult plasma. Stable carbon isotope ratios of whole blood were similar in adults and chicks, whereas stable nitrogen isotope ratios showed significant enrichment by > 1aEuro degrees in chicks. The combined FA, stable isotopes and stomach contents analyses suggest clear differences in diet quality between adults and chicks, with chicks feeding at a higher trophic position through feeding more on highly nutritious fish and adults keeping much of the less nutritious zooplankton for themselves.

J	Zhou, M; Zhu, YW; Peterson, JO				Zhou, M; Zhu, YW; Peterson, JO			In situ growth and mortality of mesozooplankton during the austral fall and winter in Marguerite Bay and its vicinity	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY												Zooplankton play a critical role in the austral winter ecosystem of the Southern Ocean, transporting biomass from lower to higher trophic level organisms through their consumption and growth, and ultimately determining the survival of marine animals such as sea birds and mammals. Previous studies have provided evidence that krill utilize zooplankton through austral winter when the primary production is negligible. Though they are different, all survival strategies produce the same result, a decrease in total zooplankton biomass. It is difficult to examine the total zooplankton biomass balance and process rates from traditional net tow samples because of the spatial variation in zooplankton distribution and the lack of applicable mathematical methods to estimate population process rates. This study focuses on short-term (overnight) loss rates of mesozooplankton associated with adult krill grazing in austral fall and the long-term (winter) body growth and removal rates of mesozooplankton in austral winter based on measurements of zooplankton size structures obtained using an Optical Plankton Counter (OPC) mounted on a Multiple Opening and Closing Nets and Environmental Sensing System (MOCNESS). In order to target an adult Euphausia superba aggregation for a short period, a 153 kHz Vessel-Mounted (VM) Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP) was used for the acoustic backscattering. The in situ process rates of growth and mortality are estimated based on the biomass balance and biomass spectrum theory. The overnight in situ grazing by adult E. superba on mesozooplankton is examined based on the in situ measurements of mesozooplankton biovolume within the water where an adult E. superba aggregation remained during a short study period in late April. The measurements show that approximately 16% of the existing mesozooplankton biovolume was removed in 4 h, which leads to an average specific daily grazing rate of 0.96 day(-1) assuming a daily feeding period of 16 h from dusk to dawn. From the amount of biovolume removed and the abundance of adult euphausiids of approximately 3 individuals m(-3) estimated from the volume backscattering strength and the size of adult euphausiids, the daily ration for an adult euphausiid is approximately equal to 7% body biovolume or biomass day(-1). The total mesozooplankton biovolume decreased at a specific rate of 0.017 day(-1) over the austral winter 2002, while the specific individual body growth was approximately 0.045 day(-1). The sum of these two rates leads to the specific mortality rate equal to approximately 0.07 day(-1) for the winter. These rates lead to a system efficiency of 67% for recycling the biomass during the winter. The measurements indicate that approximately 90% of biovolume (biomass) was removed in the period between the fall cruise in April-May and the winter cruise in August-September 2002.

Stable isotope analyses were conducted on delta C-13 and delta N-15 from the baleen plates of ten pregnant Antarctic minke whales to understand the growth rate of the baleen plate and their diet in lower latitudes. Two to three oscillations along the length of the edge of the baleen plate were observed in delta N-15, and the annual growth rate was estimated to be 75.2 +/- 20.4 mm, with a small amplitude (0.97 +/- 0.21 parts per thousand). Bayesian stable isotope mixing models were used to understand the dominant prey that contributed to the isotopic component of the baleen plate using Antarctic krill from the stomach contents and reported values of Antarctic coastal krill (Euphausia crystallorophias), Antarctic silver fish (Pleuragramma antarcticum), Australian krill spp., and Australian pelagic fish spp.. The models showed that the diet composition of the most recent three records from the base of the baleen plates (model 1) and the highest delta N-15 values in each baleen plate (model 2) were predominantly Antarctic krill, with a contribution rate of approximately 80%. The rates were approximately 10% for Antarctic coastal krill and less than 2.0% for the two Australian prey groups in both models. These results suggest that pregnant Antarctic minke whales did not feed on enough prey outside of the Antarctic to change the stable isotope values in their baleen plates.

Importance and role of zooplankton grazing in the Indian sector of the Southern Ocean	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY					Southern Ocean Joint Global Ocean Flux Symposium (SO-JGOFS)	JUL 08-12, 2000	BREST, FRANCE					Ingestion by mesozooplankton and micronekton was monitored during two of the ANTARES cruises in the Indian sector of the Southern Ocean in spring and summer. The composition of the mesozooplankton populations varied in space and with season. Copepods always dominated in number and biomass, but salps and pteropods were present in the northern part of the transect in summer. Five species of large copepod (Calanus simillimus, Calanoides acutus, Rhincalanus gigas, Calanus propinquus and Metridia gerlachei) dominated the biomass with a North-South gradient. Smaller species (Oithona spp., Ctenocalanus citer, Clausocalanus laticeps) were also present. Biomass showed a definite trend with highest levels towards the polar front zone and permanent open-ocean area. Feeding activity was monitored either for the total population (summer) or specific individuals (spring). In summer, depending on the area considered, grazing rates by mesozooplankton appeared to have a significant impact on phytoplankton primary production. In the northern part of the transect (polar front zone or PFZ), salps and to a minor extent pteropods and copepods contributed mostly to the feeding pressure. Maximum intensity was observed in the Coastal Antarctic Zone (CCSZ) where Euphausia superba (adults and calyptopis larvae) could ingest more than 100% of the daily primary production. In spring, the impact of copepods dominated the zooplankton community. Small calanoids and young stages of large species of copepods rather than adult stages were the dominant contributors to grazing pressure. In summer, respiration rates of the dominant copepod species showed that energy expenditure exceeded by far chlorophyll ingestion. This is generally interpreted as the consequence of ingestion of alternate non-chlorophyll food source. The inverse correlation between the biomass of microzooplankton and the area of maximum difference between grazing and respiration confirmed that in summer the protozoans are strongly controlled by the copepod community.

Surface oceanography of BROKE-West, along the Antarctic margin of the south-west Indian Ocean (30-80 degrees E)	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY												Hydrographic CTD and ADCP data were collected during the BROKE-West research voyage (January-March 2006) in the south-west Indian Ocean sector of the Antarctic margin. These data describe the large-scale circulation, water masses, fronts and summertime stratification in the surface layer over the continental shelf, slope and rise region between 30 and 80 degrees E that forms CCAMLR Statistical Area 58.4.2. The surface circulation matched the full-depth circulation and consisted of the eastward flowing southern Antarctic Circumpolar Current front to the north, and the westward flowing Antarctic Slope Current associated with the Antarctic Slope Front along the continental slope to the south. Two sub-polar gyres were detected south of the Southern Boundary of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current: the eastern Weddell Gyre in the Cosmonaut Sea (30-50 degrees E) and the greater Prydz Bay Gyre in the Cooperation Sea (60-80 degrees E). In the eastern Weddell Gyre, the seasonal mixed layer depths were shallower, warmer and fresher relative to the regions to the east which were deeper, cooler and more saline. This spatial variability is found to be strongly correlated to the large-scale pattern of sea ice melt/retreat in the months preceding the voyage and the accumulated wind stress thereafter. Areas of upwelling warm deep waters into the surface layer are presented from positive anomalies of potential temperature and nutrient concentrations (nitrate and silicate). These anomalies were strongest in the eastern Weddell Gyre in the vicinity of the Cosmonaut Polynya/Embayment, north of Cape Anne and near the Southern Boundary of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current in the eastern sector of the survey. The summertime stratification (seasonal mixed layer, seasonal pycnocline and T(min) layer) are discussed relative to the distributions of chl a and acoustically determined Antarctic Krill (Euphausia superba) densities. Elevated chl a concentrations were found in the surface layer of the marginal ice zone and it is proposed that these are retained south of the fast, narrow jet of enhanced Antarctic Slope Current on the upper continental slope. There is qualitative evidence of these maxima being subducted and transported north in the seasonal pycnocline in response to Ekman convergence from the easterly winds in this region. The seasonal mixed layer within the sub-polar gyres had relatively low chl a concentrations with sub-surface maxima in the seasonal pycnocline and the top of the T(min) layer. Surface concentrations increased once again north of the Southern Boundary in the north-east of the survey. Krill and chl a concentrations were both co-located and decoupled at different locations across the survey. There was no clear oceanographic boundary influencing the distribution of the krill surveyed, though further work is necessary to properly synthesize this and other biological patterns with the oceanographic processes, given the varying time and length scales and intrinsic sampling limitations.

A sum greater than its parts: merging multi-predator tracking studies to increase ecological understanding	ECOSPHERE												Understanding how animals find prey in heterogeneous environments is a central goal of ecology. Placing this process in an environmental context requires a lot of information regarding the characteristics of both the habitat selected by the animal and its surroundings. In high-latitude marine systems, information about subsurface habitats of marine predators is often very limited. Animal-borne oceanographic instruments have added a new modality to improve our understanding of marine predators and their habitats. While these instruments do not collect environmental information beyond that experienced by the animals carrying them, our study makes use of an oceanographic dataset collected by southern elephant seals (Mirounga leonina; N = 15), to provide environmental context for two sympatrically foraging penguin species in the waters close to the subantarctic island of Bouvetoya. The seals collected 154 CTD profiles during the study period, averaging 4.9 (+/- 3.67) profiles per day, documenting the stratification of the upper water layer in terms of both seawater density and temperature. Using these data, we quantitatively describe the relationship between the diving behavior of the penguins (N = 3,745 dives) and the hydrographic properties of the three-dimensional area in which they were foraging. Both penguin species appeared to favor water characterized by a shallow mixed layer. The chinstrap penguins (Pygoscelis antarctica) dove within a shallow, unstable body of water close to the colony, whereas macaroni penguins (Eudyptes chrysolophus) exploited the bottom of the surface mixed layer further offshore. The hydrographic properties preferred by the penguins match closely those that describe the highest densities of their preferred prey, krill (Euphausia superba), identified during a temporally and spatially concurrent study. We demonstrate how merging multiple telemetric data streams from animals can shed new light on aspects of foraging behavior beyond simply relating movements to two-dimensional, remotely sensed measurements of the environment.

Molecular characterization of crustacean visual pigments and the evolution of pancrustacean opsins	MOLECULAR BIOLOGY AND EVOLUTION												Investigations of opsin evolution outside of vertebrate systems have long been focused on insect visual pigments, whereas other groups have received little attention. Furthermore, few studies have explicitly investigated the selective influences across all the currently characterized arthropod opsins. In this study, we contribute to the knowledge of crustacean opsins by sequencing 1 opsin gene each from 6 previously uncharacterized crustacean species (Euphausia superba, Homarus gammarus, Archaeomysis grebnitzkii, Holmesimysis costata, Mysis diluviana, and Neomysis americana). Visual pigment spectral absorbances were measured using microspectrophotometry for species not previously characterized (A. grebnitzkii = 496 nm, H. costata = 512 nm, M. diluviana = 501 nm, and N. americana = 520 nm). These novel crustacean opsin sequences were included in a phylogenetic analysis with previously characterized arthropod opsin sequences to determine the evolutionary placement relative to the well-established insect spectral clades (long-/middle-/short-wavelength sensitive). Phylogenetic analyses indicate these novel crustacean opsins form a monophyletic clade with previously characterized crayfish opsin sequences and form a sister group to insect middle-/long-wavelength-sensitive opsins. The reconstructed opsin phylogeny and the corresponding spectral data for each sequence were used to investigate selective influences within arthropod, and mainly "pancrustacean," opsin evolution using standard d(N)/d(S) ratio methods and more sensitive techniques investigating the amino acid property changes resulting from nonsynonymous replacements in a historical (i.e., phylogenetic) context. Although the conservative d(N)/d(S) methods did not detect any selection, 4 amino acid properties (coil tendencies, compressibility, power to be at the middle of an alpha-helix, and refractive index) were found to be influenced by destabilizing positive selection. Ten amino acid sites relating to these properties were found to face the binding pocket, within 4 angstrom of the chromophore and thus have the potential to affect spectral tuning.

J	Ford, MP; Santhanakrishnan, A				Ford, Mitchell P.; Santhanakrishnan, Arvind			On the role of phase lag in multi-appendage metachronal swimming of euphausiids	BIOINSPIRATION & BIOMIMETICS												Metachronal paddling is a common method of drag-based aquatic propulsion, in which a series of swimming appendages are oscillated, with the motion of each appendage phase-shifted relative to the neighboring appendages. Ecologically and economically important euphausiid species such as Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) swim constantly by stroking their paddling appendages (pleopods), with locomotion accounting for the bulk of their metabolic expenditure. They tailor their swimming gaits for behavioral and energetic needs by changing pleopod kinematics. The functional importance of inter-pleopod phase lag (phi) to metachronal swimming performance and wake structure is unknown. To examine this relation, we developed a geometrically and dynamically scaled robot ('krillbot') capable of self-propulsion. Krillbot pleopods were prescribed to mimic published kinematics of fast-forward swimming (FFW) and hovering (HOV) gaits of E. superba, and the Reynolds number and Strouhal number of the krillbot matched well with those calculated for freely-swimming E. superba. In addition to examining published kinematics with uneven phi between pleopod pairs, we modified E. superba kinematics to uniformly vary phi from 0% to 50% of the cycle. Swimming speed and thrust were largest for FFW with phi between 15%-25%, coincident with phi range observed in FFW gait of E. superba. In contrast to synchronous rowing (phi = 0%) where distances between hinged joints of adjacent pleopods were nearly constant throughout the cycle, metachronal rowing (phi > 0%) brought adjacent pleopods closer together and moved them farther apart. This factor minimized body position fluctuation and augmented metachronal swimming speed. Though swimming speed was lowest for HOV, a ventrally angled downward jet was generated that can assist with weight support during feeding. In summary, our findings show that inter-appendage phase lag can drastically alter both metachronal swimming speed and the large-scale wake structure.

Uncertainty and natural variability in the ecological footprint of fisheries: A case study of reduction fisheries for meal and oil	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS					Academic Sessions of the Footprint Forum on State of the Art in Ecological Footprint - Theory and Applications	JUN 07-12, 2010	Univ Siena, Ecodynam Grp, Colle Val dElsa, ITALY	Global Footprint Network	Univ Siena, Ecodynam Grp			It is well understood that measurements of ecological footprint and many other ecological indicators are associated with varying degrees of uncertainty, yet imprecision in ecological footprint results is rarely assessed or communicated. We calculated the marine portion of the ecological footprint of products derived from five reduction fisheries: Peruvian anchovy (Engraulis ringens), Atlantic herring (Clupea harengus), Gulf menhaden (Brevoortia patron us), blue whiting (Micromesistius poutassou) and Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba). Monte Carlo analysis was used to measure the imprecision in marine footprint measurements resulting from multiple sources of uncertainty and natural variability in input parameters, and to determine the degree to which imprecision affects our ability to draw meaningful conclusions when comparing products sourced from different fisheries on the basis of ecological footprint. Gulf menhaden and Antarctic krill were found to have the smallest marine footprints, while blue whiting was found to have the largest. Results show that there is much uncertainty associated with marine footprint calculations and that the most significant drivers of this imprecision are uncertainty and natural variability regarding measurements of trophic level and trophic interactions. Marine footprint is highly correlated with trophic level, and clear differences can be seen when comparing species of very different trophic levels. However, comparisons of products derived from species' with similar trophic levels are less likely to provide conclusive results. The choice of mass, protein or energy content as the basis of comparison was also considered and was found to influence the results, particularly when comparing species with similar trophic levels. While it is likely that imprecision of marine footprint measurements of fishery-derived products will remain high, technological improvements and a better understanding of marine ecosystem dynamics may make future studies more precise.

Low trophic level diet of juvenile southern elephant seals Mirounga leonina from Marion Island: a stable isotope investigation using vibrissal regrowths	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												Insight into the trophic ecology of marine predators is vital for understanding their ecosystem role and predicting their responses to environmental change. Juvenile southern elephant seals (SES) Mirounga leonina are considered generalist predators within the Southern Ocean. Although mesopelagic fish and squid dominate their stomach lavage samples, the stable isotope profile captured along the length of sampled vibrissae of young SES at Macquarie Island, southwest Pacific Ocean (54.5 degrees S, 158.9 degrees E) recently emphasized the contribution of crustaceans to their diet (likely Euphausia superba). Herein, we used the stable isotope values of sampled vibrissal regrowths with known growth histories to assess the diet of juvenile SES at Marion Island, southern Indian Ocean (46.8 degrees S, 37.8 degrees E) on a temporally integrated basis. We specifically aimed to quantify the possible contribution of crustaceans to the diet of juvenile SES. Sequentially (chronologically) sampled vibrissal regrowths of 14 juvenile SES produced fine-scale dietary information spanning up to 9 mo. The depleted stable isotope signatures of nitrogen (delta N-15) (8.5 +/- 0.6 parts per thousand) and carbon (delta C-13) (-20.3 +/- 0.1 parts per thousand) measured during the period of independent foraging suggested the use of a lower trophic level diet within the Polar Frontal Zone. A mixing model predicted that up to 76% of juvenile SES diet comprised crustaceans, consisting of 2 crustacean groups, each contributing 26% (credible interval, CI: 13-39%) and 50% (CI: 35-64%) to their diets, presumably representing subantarctic krill species. This first utilisation of the isotopic signature captured along the length of vibrissal regrowths confirms the inclusion and importance of crustaceans in the diet of juvenile SES.

Feeding ecology of myctophid fishes in the northern Scotia Sea	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												The diets of 9 species of myctophid fishes, Electrona carlsbergi, E. antarctica, Gymnoscopelus fraseri, G. nicholsi, G. braueri, Protomyctophum bolini, P. choriodon, Krefftichthys anderssoni and Nannobrachium achirus, were investigated during austral autumn in the northern Scotia Sea. Based on the percent index of relative importance (%IRI), the data suggest dietary specialisation in some species, which may permit resource partitioning. Hierarchical agglomerative cluster analysis of Bray-Curtis similarity (60% threshold) separated the myctophid community into distinct feeding guilds. One group (G. braueri and E. antarctica) fed principally on Themisto gaudichaudii, another (P. choriodon and G. fraseri) primarily on copepods (Metridia spp. and Rhincalanus gigas), and a third group (G. nicholsi and F bolini) consumed copepods and euphausids (mostly Metridia spp. and Euphausia frigida). The diets of E. carlsbergi and K anderssoni differed from the other species, with E. carlsbergi being the only species that consumed salps. There was a general switch in diet from copepods to euphausiids and amphipods as the myctophid predator size increased. Dietary specialisation is likely the result of a combination of predator size, gape size, filtering capacity of the gill rakers and the vertical distribution of predators and prey. Antarctic krill were only consumed by the larger myctophids, which represented a numerically minor part of the myctophid community, supporting the concept that myctophids can provide a krill-independent link between secondary production and higher trophic levels. However, the northern Scotia Sea is dominated by adult krill, which are only suitable as prey for larger fish. In the northern Scotia Sea, myctophid predation had a very small impact on copepod production but a higher impact on macrozooplankton, with a best-estimate of 4% of the daily production of Themisto gaudichaudii and 6% of that of Euphausia superba being consumed.

Seasonal consistency and individual variation in foraging strategies differ among and within Pygoscelis penguin species in the Antarctic Peninsula region	MARINE BIOLOGY												Past research during the breeding season in the Antarctic Peninsula region indicates that gentoo penguins (Pygoscelis papua) are generalist foragers whereas Adelie (P. adeliae) and chinstrap (P. antarcticus) penguins tend to specialize on Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba). However, little is known about the degree of temporal consistency in the diets and foraging habitats of these three species, particularly at the individual level. Such year-round and interannual dietary understanding is important to help interpret contrasting trends in their populations. We used carbon and nitrogen stable isotope analysis of blood and feathers to evaluate seasonal shifts in diet and individual foraging consistency within Pygoscelis penguin species breeding in the South Shetland Islands as well as among three geographically distinct gentoo penguin populations in the western Antarctic Peninsula and South Shetland Islands. We found that gentoo penguins exhibited a generalist foraging strategy with individual consistency, Adelie penguins exhibited an intermediate generalist foraging strategy with little individual consistency, and chinstrap penguins exhibited a specialized diet with little inter-individual variation. Our results also indicated that all three species have greater variation in foraging habitat use during the post-breeding season compared to the breeding season. Finally, we observed differences in the degree of seasonal shifts in population level diet and consistency in foraging strategies at the individual level across the three gentoo penguin populations examined. This suggests that Pygoscelis penguins can differ in diets and foraging habitat use not only at the population level among species, sites, and seasons, but also in the level of variation within populations, and in the degree of seasonal consistency among individuals.

Element concentrations in meals from krill and amphipods, - Possible alternative protein sources in complete diets for farmed fish	AQUACULTURE												In the marine environment, organisms from lower trophic levels seem as a good alternative to the traditional meal and oil sources. In the present study, meals were produced from Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba), Arctic krill (Thysanoessa inermis) and the Arctic amphipod Themisto libellula. Diets were then prepared for Atlantic salmon and Atlantic cod where up to 100% of the fish meal protein was replaced by protein from these organisms. Concentrations of copper (Cu), zinc (Zn), arsenic (As), cadmium (Cd), mercury (Hg) and lead (Pb) were determined by ICP-MS in the various krill and amphipod meals, complete diets and muscle samples from fish fed these diets. The element concentrations were related to growth and general fish health as well as present EU legislations on feed ingredients and complete diets. The cod showed no difference in growth during the trial, while salmon fed diets where 40% of the fish meal protein was replaced with Arctic krill or amphipod meal shoved improved SGR during the first period of feeding (first 100 days). No adverse effects on growth rate or fish health were observed in any fish species or treatment. Nevertheless, high levels of Cu were found in the meal from Antarctic krill (46 mg kg(-1) dry matter (dm)) resulting in a dietary level of Cu exceeding the upper limit for complete feedingstuff set by EU. Furthermore, the Cd level found in the meal from amphipod (12 mg kg(-1) dm) was 6 times higher than EU's upper limit. This indicates limitations for the use of certain zooplanktons as alternative protein sources in feed for farmed fish, unless future processing methods yield lower levels of these unwanted elements.

Palmer', we: (1) assessed the habitat chosen for moulting by emperor penguins, Aptenodytes forsteri, (2) determined their pre- and post-moult diets, (3) measured the pre- and post-moult body mass of the birds, and (4) tracked their post-moult movements. Diet was based on the colour of guano near the edges of ice floes and fast-ice areas. Pre- and post-moult birds were weighed at locations along the transect. Satellite transmitters were attached to 7 birds, and tracked for up to 5 mo. Birds moulted in concentrated pack ice and coastal fast ice. Offshore from the shelf slope, diet was mostly Antarctic krill Euphausia superba. Over the shelf, the diet was mainly fish and squid. Body masses of birds immediately after the moult were often less than 20 kg. After moult, satellite tracked birds remained in the pack ice but moved to the west at a rate of 13 to 41 km d(-1). One bird traveled to the Cape Roget colony, where it arrived on 15 April after 70 d and 2140 km of travel. We conclude that (1) birds are close to starvation by the end of the moult, (2) it is essential that an abundant food supply is in close proximity to the moult area, (3) penguins travel more than 2000 km on the return journey to their colonies of the western Ross Sea, and (4) reduction in the extent and seasonal duration of the pack ice would be reflected in a rapid change in the size of the breeding population of coastal west Antarctica.					, gerald/0000-0002-8872-2950												0171-8630	1616-1599					2004	267						281	290		10.3354/meps267281							WOS:000220562100023

Theoretical estimates of target strength based on a straight cylinder model and applied to the numbers and sizes of euphausiids in net samples yielded estimates of mean volume backscattering strength (MVBS) that compared favorably with observed values at low abundances. However, net samples underestimated biomass by almost two orders of magnitude at high abundances, a feature we attribute to net avoidance. Other taxonomic groups of macrozooplankton did not appear to contribute significantly to acoustic backscatter. Distributions of euphausiids were similar to those observed in summer; we found no evidence for abundant aggregations immediately below surface sea-ice. Euphausia superba dominated the biomass at all stations; individuals of approximately 22 mm were most abundant at 30-70 m depth, whereas 40-mm individuals were most abundant at 90-130 m. Thysanoessa macrura was positioned deeper in the water column, from 150 to 250 m, and Euphausia crystallorophias was centered on 100 m. The first two species were distributed throughout the study area, but E. crystallorophias was concentrated in coastal embayments. Total wet weight biomass ranged from 0.009 to 92 g m-3, dry weight ranged from 0.002 to 18 g m-3, and protein ranged from 0.0009 to 9 g m-3, mostly concentrated in the 30-70 m depth stratum. Over the upper 200 m of the water column integrated wet weight biomass estimated from ADCP data was in the range from 29 g m-2 to 92 kg m-2.																	0967-0637	1879-0119				SEP	1994	41	9					1425	1445		10.1016/0967-0637(94)90106-6							WOS:A1994PM49300009

Polar organisms are reported to bioaccumulate lipophilic contaminant, viz persistent organic pollutants (POPS). Legacy POPs and flame retardants (polybrominated diphenyl ethers, PBDEs) were studied in key species of the Ross Sea (Euphausia superba, Pleuragramma antarctica) and their predators (Dissostichus mawsoni, Pygoscelis adeliae, Aptenodytes forsteri, Catharacta maccormicki, Leptonychotes weddellii). Gaschromatography revealed the presence of PCBs, HCB, DDTs, PBDEs in most of the samples; HCHs, dieldrin, Eldrin, non-ortho PCBs, PCDDs, PCDFs were detected only in some species. The average Sigma PBDEs was 0.19-1.35 pg/g wet wt in the key-species and one-two order of magnitude higher in the predators. Penguins and skuas from an area where a long-term field camp is located showed higher BDE concentrations. The Sigma DDTs was higher in the Antarctic toothfish (20 +/- 6.73 ng/g wet wt) and in the South Polar skua (5.911 +/- 3.425 ng/g wet wt). The TEQ5 were evaluated and the highest concentration was found in the Weddell seal, due to PCB169, 1,2,3,4,7,8-HxCDF, and 2,3,4,6,7,8-HxCDF. There was no significant relationship between the trophic level and the POP concentrations. Although low concentrations, organisms of the Ross Sea trophic web should be further studied: lack of information on some ecotoxicological features and human impacts including global change may distress the ecosystem with unpredictable effects.

Microplastics and other anthropogenic particles in Antarctica: Using penguins as biological samplers	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Microplastics (< 5 mm in size) are known to be widespread in the marine environment but are still poorly studied in Polar Regions, particularly in the Antarctic. As penguins have a wide distribution around Antarctica, three congeneric species: Adelie (Pygoscelis adeliae), chinstrap (Pygoscelis antarcticus) and gentoo penguins (Pygoscelis papua) were selected to evaluate the occurrence of microplastics across the Antarctic Peninsula and Scotia Sea. Scat samples (used as a proxy of ingestion), were collected from breeding colonies over seven seasons between 2006 and 2016. Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba), present in scat samples, contributed 85%, 66% and 54% of the diet in terms of frequency of occurrence to the diet of Adelie, gentoo and chinstrap penguins, respectively. Microplastics were found in 15%, 28% and 29% scats of Adelie, chinstrap and gentoo penguin respectively. A total of 92 particles were extracted from the scats (n = 317) and 32% (n = 29) were chemically identified via micro-Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (mu-FTIR). From all the particles extracted, 35% were identified as microplastics, particularly polyethylene (80%) and polyester (10%). It was not possible to ascertain the identification of the remaining 10% of samples. Other anthropogenic particles were identified in 55% of samples, identified as cellulose fibres. The results show a similar frequency of occurrence of particles across all colonies, suggesting there is no particular point source for microplastic pollution in the Scotia Sea. Additionally, no clear temporal variation in the number of microplastics in penguins was observed. Overall, this study reveals the presence of microplastics across Antarctica, in three penguin species and offers evidence of other anthropogenic particles in high numbers. Further research is needed to better understand the spatio-temporal dynamics, fate and effect of microplastics on these ecosystems, and improve plastic pollution policies in Antarctica.

Humpback whale "super-groups" - A novel low-latitude feeding behaviour of Southern Hemisphere humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) in the Benguela Upwelling System	PLOS ONE												Southern Hemisphere humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) generally undertake annual migrations from polar summer feeding grounds to winter calving and nursery grounds in subtropical and tropical coastal waters. Evidence for such migrations arises from seasonality of historic whaling catches by latitude, Discovery and natural mark returns, and results of satellite tagging studies. Feeding is generally believed to be limited to the southern polar region, where Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) has been identified as the primary prey item. Non-migrations and / or suspended migrations to the polar feeding grounds have previously been reported from a summer presence of whales in the Benguela System, where feeding on euphausiids (E. lucens), hyperiid amphipods (Themisto gaudichaudii), mantis shrimp (Pterygosquilla armata capensis) and clupeid fish has been described. Three recent research cruises (in October/November 2011, October/November 2014 and October/November 2015) identified large tightly-spaced groups (20 to 200 individuals) of feeding humpback whales aggregated over at least a one-month period across a 220 nautical mile region of the southern Benguela System. Feeding behaviour was identified by lunges, strong milling and repetitive and consecutive diving behaviours, associated bird and seal feeding, defecations and the pungent "fishy" smell of whale blows. Although no dedicated prey sampling could be carried out within the tightly spaced feeding aggregations, observations of E. lucens in the region of groups and the full stomach contents of mantis shrimp from both a co-occurring predatory fish species (Thyrsites atun) and one entangled humpback whale mortality suggest these may be the primary prey items of at least some of the feeding aggregations. Reasons for this recent novel behaviour pattern remain speculative, but may relate to increasing summer humpback whale abundance in the region. These novel, predictable, inter-annual, low latitude feeding events provide considerable potential for further investigation of Southern Hemisphere humpback feeding behaviours in these relatively accessible low-latitude waters.

While salp abundance is hypothesized to increase, krill abundance is hypothesized to decline with dramatic consequences for the entire food web of the Southern Ocean. A better understanding of the biotic interaction between krill and salps and their population dynamics is thus crucial. However, the life cycle of salps is complicated and barely understood. Therefore, we have developed an individual-based model describing the whole life cycle to better understand the population dynamics of salps and the conditions for blooms. The model has been used to explore if and under what conditions the empirical pattern of large variability in observed salp abundances at the WAP, generated by the long-term data of the US Antarctic Marine Living Resources Program (AMLR) can emerge from a small seeding population. The model reproduced this empirical pattern if daily growth rates of oozoids were higher than previously reported for the WAP (mean growth rate for oozoids similar to 1 mm d(-1)) and if growth rates of blastozooids were lower (mean growth rate similar to 0.2 mm d(-1)). The model suggests that a prerequisite for local salp blooms requires a small founding population in early spring. With climate change it has been suggested that more frequent and earlier transport of salps into the WAP or winter survival will occur. Hence, the risk of salp blooms in the WAP is likely to substantially increase. These findings highlight the importance for an improved quantitative understanding of how primary production and the southward advection of salps will be impacted by climate change.

Topological properties of polar food webs	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												Mean annual temperatures of the Arctic Ocean and Antarctic Peninsula are warming much faster than global mean warming rates, which will likely result in significant biological impacts. Whereas most assessments have been made on individual species, impacts may differ when entire ecosystems are considered, as effects may propagate through ecological interactions such as those in food webs (FWs). The vulnerability of FWs to adverse effects can be estimated from the topology of the networks involved. Here we describe topological characteristics of Arctic and Antarctic marine FWs relevant to their vulnerability to climate change. We analyzed 15 properties of the largest Arctic and Antarctic marine FWs available, and found important topological differences between them. The Arctic FW has greater top to basal and predator to prey species ratios and is more densely connected, with more omnivorous species, than the Antarctic FW. The cumulative degree distribution (CDD; cumulative distribution of the number of links that each species in the food web has) of the Arctic FW follows an exponential decay behavior, whereas that of the Antarctic has a power law cut-off at higher degrees. The differences in the properties analyzed indicate that the Arctic FW has a greater diversity of predators and top species, while the Antarctic has a greater diversity of prey and basal species. The former seems to be more vulnerable to trophic cascade effects resulting from losses of key predator species than the latter. Characteristics of CDDs suggest that the Arctic FW may be more robust against random extinctions of species, although it may be more vulnerable to extinctions affecting the most connected prey species, such as Antarctic krill Euphausia superba, which is the most connected prey species in this trophic network.

J	Phleger, CF; Nelson, MM; Mooney, BD; Nichols, PD				Phleger, CF; Nelson, MM; Mooney, BD; Nichols, PD			Wax esters versus triacylglycerols in myctophid fishes from the Southern Ocean	ANTARCTIC SCIENCE												Five species of myctophid fishes were collected by trawl from the Elephant: Island region of the Antarctic Peninsula between 60 degrees 30'-62 degrees S and 55 degrees-61 degrees 30'W. Two species, Gymnoscopelus braueri and Krefftichthyes anderssoni were lipid-rich (406-456 mg g(-1) dry weight whole fish) with wax esters (WE) the major lipid class. In three species, G. opisthopterus, G. nicholsi, and Electrona carlsbergii, triacylglycerols (TAG) were the major lipid. All fish had oily bones, with values up to 471 mg g(-1) dry weight: in the vertebral centra of K. anderssoni. The principal fatty acids of the TAG-rich myctophids included the monoenes 18:1(n-9) and 20:1. There were lower levels of 16:0 and 18:0 saturated fatty acids. Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) were present at higher abundance in the TAG-rich E. carlsbergii and G, opisthopterus, with lower levels in G. nicholsi. In comparison, the WE-dominated species contained lower levels of PUFA than in the TAG-rich species. The principal fatty acids of the WE-rich myctophids included the monoenes 18: 1(n-9), 16: 1(n-7), and 18:1(n-7), with lower levels of the saturated acids 16:0 and 18:0. Fatty alcohols were dominated by 16:0 and 14:0 and the monounsaturated 18:1(n-9) with 16:1(n-7), 18:1(n-7), and 20:1(n-9). Based on the fatty acid profiles, the diet of G. opisthopterus and G. nicholsi, previously thought to be mainly Euphausia superba, is suggested to include copepods and other zooplankton with only a minor krill component, possibly consisting of other species than E. superba.

J	Nicol, S; Brierley, AS				Nicol, Stephen; Brierley, Andrew S.			Through a glass less darkly-New approaches for studying the distribution, abundance and biology of Euphausiids	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY												Euphausiids are vital components of many oceanic foodwebs. Due to their large size, they are key prey species for many vertebrates, and several species are subject to commercial fisheries. The best studied euphausiid species is Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba), and a considerable literature exists documenting its ecology. The abundance of Antarctic krill varies enormously over multiple time and space scales in the Southern Ocean. This variability is driven partly by physical processes, but also by the behaviour of the animals as individuals and as groups. It is likely that such variability also affects the populations of other large euphausiid species. In order to understand this variability, particularly in the context of rapid environmental change and expanding fisheries interests, we need to shift emphasis from conventional point- and transect-sampling conducted from brief research cruises usually in summer to basin-scale observations over extended time periods. Future studies of the large-scale biology of krill of all species will also need to consider how their growth, reproduction and behaviour might alter in response to predicted environmental changes such as decline in sea ice cover, rising temperature and acidification of the ocean. Paradoxically, to answer many outstanding questions in krill biology, there also needs to be a shift towards examining the three-dimensional dynamics of krill aggregations on very small space and timescales. This paper outlines some of the approaches that might enable us to make progress in understanding these key organisms at multiple spatial and temporal scales, approaches that in turn may leave us better able to manage krill populations into the future. Whilst the paper's focus is primarily on Antarctic krill, the findings are applicable generally to other large, schooling euphausiid species. Crown Copyright (C) 2009 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

J	MCKENNA, JE				MCKENNA, JE			TROPHIC RELATIONSHIPS WITHIN THE ANTARCTIC DEMERSAL FISH COMMUNITY OF SOUTH GEORGIA ISLAND	FISHERY BULLETIN												Knowledge of trophic relationships is vital to understanding any ecological community. The trophic relationships of Antarctic demersal fish are poorly known and have been described quantitatively by only a few researchers. Gut contents were analyzed on over 300 stomachs from fish collected during the 1987-88 AMLR ground fish survey of South Georgia I., Antarctica. All fish were collected with a bottom trawl during the austral summer. Fifteen species of demersal fish (including those of commercial value) were collected. Similarity analysis was applied to the diet information to describe trophic relationships in the South Georgia community. The most abundant species of the South Georgia demersal fish community were classified into three groups based on summer diets. The largest group contained species heavily dependent on krill Euphausia superba, and included Champsocephalus gunnari and Notothenia rossii. The second group was comprised of piscivores. Three of the four members of this group (Dissostichus eleginoides, Chaenocephalus aceratus, and Pseudochaenichthys georgianus) are commercially valuable. The food of their prey often consisted of krill. The third group contained a loose association of species which feed on benthic organisms more than did other fish species in the community. Notothenia gibberifrons and Notothenia squamifrons were the important commercial species in this group. Krill was found to be the most important prey species to the fish in the South Georgia system. However, based on the analysis of diet overlap, competition appeared to be unimportant in this community during the austral summer. Selective reduction of populations within the fish community by fishing may have widespread repercussions. Many of the commercially valuable species feed on other fish species which in turn feed on krill or benthic organisms. The relatively simple but highly interconnected food web in the South Georgia system may have a lower potential for fish yield than previously thought.																	0090-0656					OCT	1991	89	4					643	654									WOS:A1991GU46000009

Palmer LTER: Patterns of distribution of five dominant zooplankton species in the epipelagic zone west of the Antarctic Peninsula, 1993-2004	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY												Variability in the temporal-spatial distribution and abundance of zooplankton was documented each summer on the Palmer Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) grid west of the Antarctic Peninsula between Anvers and Adelaide Islands during a 12-yr time series. Oblique tows to 120 m with a 2 x 2 m fixed-frame net were made at about 50 stations each January/February between 1993 and 2004. The numerically dominant macro- and mesozooplanktonic species >2mm included three species of euphausiids (Euphausia superba, Antarctic krill; Thysano ssa macrura; Euphausia crystallorophias, ice krill), a shelled pteropod (Limacina helicina), and a salp (Salpa thompsoni). Life cycles, life spans, and habitat varied among these species. Abundance data from each year were allocated to 100 km by 20 km (alongshore by on/offshore) grid cells centered on cardinal transect lines and stations within the Palmer LTER grid. The long-term mean or climatology and means for each year were used to calculate annual anomalies across the grid. Principal components analysis (PCA) was used to analyze for patterns and trends in the temporal-spatial variability of the five species. Questions included whether there are groups of species with similar patterns, and whether population cycles, species interactions or seasonal sea-ice parameters were correlated with detected patterns. Patterns in the climatology were distinct, and matched those of physical parameters. Common features included higher abundance in the north than in the south, independent of the cross-shelf gradients, and cross-shelf gradients with higher abundance either inshore (E. crystallorophias) or offshore (S. thompsoni). Anomalies revealed either cycles in the population, as episodic recruitment in Antarctic krill, or changes in anomaly pattern between the first and second half of the sampling period. The 1998 year, which coincided with a rapid change from a negative to a positive phase in the SOI, emerged as a year with either significant anomalies or that marked a change in anomaly patterns for different species. PCA analysis showed that the pattern of cumulative variance with increasing number of modes was distinctly different for shorter-lived versus longer-lived species; the first mode accounted for nearly 50% of the variance in the shorter-lived species and less than 25% in the longer-lived species. This suggested that the mechanisms driving variability in the temporal-spatial distribution of the shorter-lived, more oceanic species were less complex and more direct than those for the longer-lived euphausiids. Evidence from both the anomaly plots and the trend analysis suggested that salps have been more consistently present across the shelf from 1999 to present, and that the range of L. helicina has been expanding. With shorter life spans, these two species can respond more quickly to the increasing heat content on the shelf in this region. The cross-correlation analysis illustrated the negative correlation between salps and ice retreat and the number of ice days, and the positive correlation between the presence of ice krill and the day of ice retreat. These results suggest that for these species, several environmental controls on distribution and abundance were linked to seasonal sea-ice dynamics. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Oceanographically, March/April 2000 was abnormal, with warm conditions close to South Georgia. These conditions affected albatross foraging behaviour, particularly that of grey-headed albatrosses. Both species tended to forage in different areas of the ocean, with significant differences in trip durations. Grey-headed albatrosses (n = 9) foraged mainly in Antarctic waters (predominantly shelf waters of the South Shetland Islands and Antarctic Peninsula, and also in oceanic waters around South Georgia), feeding mainly on krill (Euphausia superba; 77% by mass). Foraging trips lasted 13.3 days (range: 5-26 days), far longer than the 1-3 days found in previous studies. Only one grey-headed albatross was associated with the APF (Antarctic Polar Front), a reported foraging area in recent studies. Wandering albatrosses (n=9) foraged in Antarctic (South Georgia Shelf) and Antarctic Polar Frontal Zone (APFZ) waters, with trips of 1-4 days trip duration (usual for this species), feeding on fish (46% by mass) and cephalopods (32%). One bird was associated with the APF, and two birds foraged on the shelf/shelf break over the Patagonian shelf. These findings suggest that sea surface temperature anomalies, produced by movement of the APF closer to South Georgia or by eddies, may have had an effect on the foraging strategy of greyheaded albatrosses that year (the main prey of grey-headed albatrosses in previous studies, the omma-strephid Martialia hyadesi, is known to be associated with the APF). Also, when both albatross breeding periods overlap, their foraging areas were complementary, which reflected the prey taken.					/0000-0002-9621-6660												0025-3162					AUG	2003	143	2					221	232		10.1007/s00227-003-1049-0							WOS:000185536900002

Possible biotransformations of fatty acids in the food chain were examined in mixed zooplankton and krill faecal material from the Ligurian Sea and Kattegat. The Ligurian Sea population was distinguished from the Kattegat and Clyde Sea populations in terms of both TG and PL fatty acid profiles. The Kattegat and Clyde Sea populations were separated from each other in terms of their PL fatty acid profiles only. Krill sampled in winter from all sites had significantly higher levels of 20:1 and 22:1 fatty acids in the TG fraction (9-17%) than krill sampled in summer (1-10%). These fatty acids in particular indicate carnivorous dietary input, as they are found in high levels in copepods, which are the major prey species of M. norvegica. Levels of 22:6(n-3) were significantly higher than 20:5(n-3) in Ligurian krill, which, together with other specific marker fatty acids, suggested a predominance of dinoflagellates and other nondiatom species in their diet. TG fatty acids in Kattegat and Clyde Sea krill indicate a predominance of diatoms in the diet.

Impacts of rising sea temperature on krill increase risks for predators in the Scotia Sea	PLOS ONE												Climate change is a threat to marine ecosystems and the services they provide, and reducing fishing pressure is one option for mitigating the overall consequences for marine biota. We used a minimally realistic ecosystem model to examine how projected effects of ocean warming on the growth of Antarctic krill, Euphausia superba, might affect populations of krill and dependent predators (whales, penguins, seals, and fish) in the Scotia Sea. We also investigated the potential to mitigate depletion risk for predators by curtailing krill fishing at different points in the 21st century. The projected effects of ocean warming on krill biomass were strongest in the northern Scotia Sea, with a >= 40% decline in the mass of individual krill. Projections also suggest a 25% chance that krill biomass will fall below an established depletion threshold (75% of its unimpacted level), with consequent risks for some predator populations, especially penguins. Average penguin abundance declined by up to 30% of its unimpacted level, with up to a 50% chance of falling below the depletion threshold. Simulated krill fishing at currently permitted harvest rates further increased risks for depletion, and stopping fishing offset the increased risks associated with ocean warming in our model to some extent. These results varied by location and species group. Risk reductions at smaller spatial scales also differed from those at the regional level, which suggests that some predator populations may be more vulnerable than others to future changes in krill biomass. However, impacts on predators did not always map directly to those for krill. Our findings indicate the importance of identifying vulnerable marine populations and targeting protection measures at appropriate spatial scales, and the potential for spatially-structured management to avoid aggravating risks associated with rising ocean temperatures. This may help balance tradeoffs among marine ecosystem services in an uncertain future.				, Jefferson/AAG-1702-2021; Simeon, Hill L/B-2307-2008	, Jefferson/0000-0002-3600-1414; 												1932-6203					JAN 31	2018	13	1							e0191011	10.1371/journal.pone.0191011							WOS:000423668400032	29385153

Foraging distribution and competition for prey between Adelie and chinstrap penguins	MARINE BIOLOGY												Adelie (Pygoscelis adeliae) and chinstrap penguins (P. antarctica) are morphologically and ecologically very similar, have very similar diet and breed sympatrically in the Scotia Arc from the South Sandwich Islands to the Antarctic Peninsula. To investigate how these two species co-exist, their foraging distribution and diet were studied during the chick-rearing period at Signy Island, South Orkney Islands, during the breeding seasons of 2000 and 2001. Satellite tracking data from of 19 Adelie penguins and 24 chinstrap penguins were used to compare foraging distributions. In both years the diet of both species was exclusively Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) of the same size range. In a year of low prey availability (2000), there was a statistically significant segregation of foraging areas between the two species, however, in a year of normal resource availability (2001) there was no such segregation. There was a significant difference in the foraging areas used by Adelie penguins between years but not for chinstrap penguins. Adelie penguins foraged significantly farther (mean 100 km) from the colony than chinstrap penguins (mean 58 km) in 2000 but not in 2001 (mean 58 km and 35 km respectively). In 2000, the breeding success of Adelie penguins was 51% lower than the long-term mean compared to 15% lower in chinstrap penguins. Both species achieved above average breeding success in 2001. The changes in foraging distribution and breeding success suggest that in years of low resource availability, chinstrap penguins may be able to competitively exclude Adelie penguins from potential inshore foraging areas. Current trends in climatic change and possible effects on ice distribution and krill abundance suggest that conditions could become less favourable for Adelie penguins than chinstrap penguins in areas where both species occur.																	0025-3162					DEC	2002	141	6					1165	1174		10.1007/s00227-002-0899-1							WOS:000180044300018

Five extruded diets were fed to salmon with an average weight of 546 g. distributed into 15 tanks equipped with flow through sea water. During extrusion, increased krill meal resulted in increased lipid content in the feed mash and subsequently decreased pellet expansion and decreased pellet water stability. The salmon had an optimum growth rate with a PDKM/PPC inclusion of 400 g kg(-1). Starch digestibility decreased and lipid digestibility increased with increasing PDKM/PPC inclusion. Fluoride in faeces increased linearly with increasing dietary fluoride levels.

Assemblages of micronektonic fishes and invertebrates in a gradient of regional warming along the Western Antarctic Peninsula	JOURNAL OF MARINE SYSTEMS												Micronektonic fishes and invertebrates were sampled with 32 midwater trawls at nine sites along the Western Antarctic Peninsula (WAP) in the austral fall (March-April) of 2010. Study sites were located within four hypothesized hydrographic regions: near Joinville Island in Region I, at Croker Passage, near Anvers Island, and near Renaud Island in Region II, within Marguerite Bay and the Marguerite Trough in Region III, and near Charcot Island in Region IV. A total of 62 taxa representing 12 taxonomic groups of pelagic invertebrates and 9 families of fish were captured, but assemblages were dominated by only a few species. The most numerically abundant taxa were the euphausiids, Thysanoessa macrura, Euphausia superba, and E. crystallorophias, combining to contribute nearly 79% of the total catch. Biomass dominants included E. superba, which contributed more than 44% of the total catch, the notothenioid Pleuragramma antarctica, and the salp, Salpa thompsoni. A comparison of total catches among sites revealed that the largest volumetric abundances and biomasses were captured at the Marguerite Bay site. Cluster analysis of abundance data identified distinct multispecies assemblages at Joinville Island in Region I, Croker Passage in Region II, Marguerite Bay in Region III, and Charcot Island in Region N. A fifth distinct assemblage included samples from sites near Anvers and Renaud Island in Region II, and from the Marguerite Trough in Region III. Assemblages at Joinville Island and Croker Passage were both dominated by E. superba and S. thompsoni, but hydrographic conditions at Joinville Island favored a neritic assemblage, underscored by substantial numbers of P. antarctica. The assemblage at Croker Passage was more oceanic in nature with major inputs from the myctophid, Electrona antarctica and the hyperiid amphipod, Themisto gaudichaudii. Marguerite Bay and Charcot Island were well-mixed assemblages with strong representation by both neritic and oceanic fauna. The mid-peninsula assemblage was oceanic in character, being overwhelmingly dominated by Thysanoessa macrura and T. gaudichaudii. Pleuragramma antarctica were captured at five sites: Joinville Island, Croker Passage, Marguerite Bay, and the two sites near Charcot Island. They were completely absent at the two sites near Anvers Island, at Renaud Island, and in the Marguerite Trough. One fish was captured in Croker Passage. The majority of fish captured in Marguerite Bay were larger than 150 mm standard length (SL), with very few fish of smaller size present If resident populations of Pleuragramma reproduce and recruit locally rather than being sustained by larval advection, those populations will be highly susceptible to local disappearance. This may be the causative factor behind the absence of Pleuragramma from the mid-peninsula region. Continued warming and subsequent sea ice reductions may not only cause Pleuragramma population collapses in the Marguerite Bay and Charcot Island regions, but may also change the character of the faunal assemblages along the WAP to those of an oceanic system.

J	KELLERMANN, A; SCHADWINKEL, S				KELLERMANN, A; SCHADWINKEL, S			WINTER ASPECTS OF THE ICHTHYOPLANKTON COMMUNITY IN ANTARCTIC PENINSULA WATERS	POLAR BIOLOGY												Ichthyoplankton was sampled from the Antarctic Peninsula area of the South Polar Ocean in early winter (May and June 1986). A total of 153 eggs from two species and 1368 larvae or juvenile stages from 12 species were obtained. These included pelagic species, and demersal species with a long pelagic larval or juvenile phase. Most abundant were larvae of Pleuragramma antarcticum and Notothenia kempi, and eggs of Notothenia neglecta. The distribution of notothenioid and paralepidid larvae was apparently unaffected by ice cover, whereas myctophid larvae were confined to ice-free waters. Areas where newly hatched Chionodraco hamatus occurred coincided with dense aggregations of Euphausia superba (Krill) furcilia larvae which is a potential food resource during winter. The hatching of icefish larvae during winter is apparently independent of the seasonal production cycle. Epipelagic eggs of Notothenia neglecta were found during the spawning season, which suggests that eggs ascend to the surface after demersal spawning and that development takes place near the sea surface during winter. Larvae of Notothenia kempi were chiefly confined to shelf and slope waters to the west of the Antarctic Peninsula, with larger larvae found in coastal shelf areas. Pleuragramma antarcticum occurred in the coastal waters off the Biscoe Islands, in the Gerlache Strait, and in the northern Bransfield Strait. The smallest larvae were found in the northern Bransfield Strait, whereas those at the Biscoe Islands and in Gerlache Strait waters were larger and of a similar size. A cyclonic gyre to the west of the Antarctic Peninsula observed in the austral summer was likely to have affected the larval drift of Pleuragramma antarcticum and Notothenia kempi. Differences in the timing of spawning and hatching and the vertical distribution of these larvae will lead to different transport and spatial distribution patterns. It is hypothesized that early winter conditions do not imply severe limitations on the year-class success of larval fish. Dispersal and increased mortality may occur during the second half of the winter.																	0722-4060					MAY	1991	11	2					117	127									WOS:A1991FN90600005						
J	Woods, B; Walters, A; Hindell, M; Trebilco, R				Woods, Briannyn; Walters, Andrea; Hindell, Mark; Trebilco, Rowan			Isotopic insights into mesopelagic niche space and energy pathways on the southern Kerguelen Plateau	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY												Mesopelagic fish are an important but poorly understood mid-trophic component of pelagic food webs. There are major uncertainties regarding their trophodynamics and their overall contribution to the broader Southern Ocean food web. This study aimed to investigate the trophic role of mesopelagic fish in the region of the southern Kerguelen Plateau, an area of known importance to an abundant and diverse community of marine predators. We used carbon and nitrogen stable isotopes to quantify the isotopic niches of key mesopelagic fish species (six from the family Myctophidae, and one from Bathylagidae), and assessed variation along the delta N-15 (resource use) and delta C-13 (carbon source) axes between species. The assemblage of key mesopelagic fish occupied similar isotopic niche space with overlap among species in both delta C-13 and delta N-15 values. Baseline corrected delta N-15 values provided evidence of latitudinal trends in trophic position (TP). Trophic position estimates of taxa in the southern region of our study area spanned slightly less than 1 TP (mean TP 2.9-3.7); and 1 TP in the northern region (mean TP 3.2-4.2). We found evidence of trophic partitioning between species with differences in niche utilization (resource or habitat use). Factors reducing trophic competition include the relative importance of Euphausia superba as a prey item, vertical distribution of consumer and prey, and migratory behaviours. Size-based trophic structuring between species was evident with larger species displaying higher average delta N-15 values compared to smaller species. However, fish standard length explained little of the variation in delta N-15 values at the species level, suggesting within species changes in trophic position with body size is not a predominant driver of trophic structure in our study region. Overall, our analysis demonstrated the structural complexity and spatial variation of the food web in the region of the southern Kerguelen Plateau.

J	Wege, M; Salas, L; LaRue, M				Wege, Mia; Salas, Leo; LaRue, Michelle			Ice matters: Life-history strategies of two Antarctic seals dictate climate change eventualities in the Weddell Sea	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY												The impacts of climate change in Antarctica and the Southern Ocean are not uniform and ice-obligate species with dissimilar life-history characteristics will likely respond differently to their changing ecosystems. We use a unique data set of Weddell Leptonychotes weddellii and crabeater seals' (CESs) Lobodon carcinophaga breeding season distribution in the Weddell Sea, determined from satellite imagery. We contrast the theoretical climate impacts on both ice-obligate predators who differ in life-history characteristics: CESs are highly specialized Antarctic krill Euphausia superba predators and breed in the seasonal pack ice; Weddell seals (WESs) are generalist predators and breed on comparatively stable fast ice. We used presence-absence data and a suite of remotely sensed environmental variables to build habitat models. Each of the environmental predictors is multiplied by a 'climate change score' based on known responses to climate change to create a 'change importance product'. Results show CESs are more sensitive to climate change than WESs. Crabeater seals prefer to breed close to krill, and the compounding effects of changing sea ice concentrations and sea surface temperatures, the proximity to krill and abundance of stable breeding ice, can influence their post-breeding foraging success and ultimately their future breeding success. But in contrast to the Ross Sea, here WESs prefer to breed closer to larger colonies of emperor penguins (Aptenodytes forsteri). This suggests that the Weddell Sea may currently be prey-abundant, allowing the only two air-breathing Antarctic silverfish predators (Pleuragramma antarctica) (WESs and emperor penguins) to breed closer to each other. This is the first basin-scale, region-specific comparison of breeding season habitat in these two key Antarctic predators based on real-world data to compare climate change responses. This work shows that broad-brush, basin-scale approaches to understanding species-specific responses to climate change are not always appropriate, and regional models are needed-especially when designing marine protected areas.

Mercury biomagnification in a Southern Ocean food web	ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION												Biomagnification of mercury (Hg) in the Scotia Sea food web of the Southern Ocean was examined using the stable isotope ratios of nitrogen (delta N-15) and carbon (delta C-13) as proxies for trophic level and feeding habitat, respectively. Total Hg and stable isotopes were measured in samples of particulate organic matter (POM), zooplankton, squid, myctophid fish, notothenioid fish and seabird tissues collected in two years (austral summers 2007/08 and 2016/17). Overall, there was extensive overlap in delta C-13 values across taxonomic groups suggesting similarities in habitats, with the exception of the seabirds, which showed some differences, possibly due to the type of tissue analysed (feathers instead of muscle). delta N-15 showed increasing enrichment across groups in the order POM to zooplankton to squid to myctophid fish to notothenioid fish to seabirds. There were significant differences in delta N-15 and delta C-13 values among species within taxonomic groups, reflecting inter-specific variation in diet. Hg concentrations increased with trophic level, with the lowest values in POM (0.0005 +/- 0.0002 mg g(-1) dw) and highest values in seabirds (3.88 +/- 2.41 mg g(-1) in chicks of brown skuas Stercorarius antarcticus). Hg concentrations tended to be lower in 2016/17 than in 2007/08 for mid-trophic level species (squid and fish), but the opposite was found for top predators (i.e. seabirds), which had higher levels in the 2016/17 samples. This may reflect an interannual shift in the Scotia Sea marine food web, caused by the reduced availability of a key prey species, Antarctic krill Euphausia superba. In 2016/17, seabirds would have been forced to feed on higher trophic-level prey, such as myctophids, that have higher Hg burdens. These results suggest that changes in the food web are likely to affect the pathway of mercury to Southern Ocean top predators. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Diet and trophic niche of Antarctic silverfish Pleuragramma antarcticum in the Ross Sea, Antarctica	JOURNAL OF FISH BIOLOGY												The diet of Antarctic silverfish Pleuragramma antarcticum was evaluated by examining stomach contents of specimens collected in the Ross Sea (71 degrees 77 degrees S; 165 degrees 180 degrees E) in January to March 2008. Pleuragramma antarcticum (50236 mm standard length, LS) and prey items were analysed for stable-isotopic composition of carbon and nitrogen. According to index of relative importance (IRI), which incorporates frequency of occurrence, mass and number of prey items, the most important prey items were copepods (81%IRI over all specimens), predominantly Metridia gerlachei and Paraeuchaeta sp., with krill and fishes having low IRI (2.2 and 5.6%IRI overall). According to mass of prey (M) in stomachs, however, fishes (P. antarcticum and myctophids) and krill dominated overall diet (48 and 22%M, respectively), with copepods being a relatively minor constituent of overall diet by mass (9.9%M). Piscivory by P. antarcticum occurred mainly in the extreme south-west of the region and near the continental slope. Krill identified to species level in P. antarcticum stomachs were predominantly Euphausia superba (14.1%M) with some Euphausia crystallophorias (4.8%M). Both DistLM modelling (PRIMER-permanova+) on stomach contents (by IRI) and stepwise generalized linear modelling on stable isotopes showed that LS and location were significant predictors of P. antarcticum diet. Postlarval P. antarcticum (5089 mm LS) consumed exclusively copepods. Juvenile P. antarcticum (90151 mm LS) consumed predominantly krill and copepods by mass (46 and 30%M, respectively). Small adult P. antarcticum (152178 mm LS) consumed krill, fishes and copepods (37, 36 and 15%M, respectively). Large adult P. antarcticum (179236 mm LS) consumed predominantly fishes and krill (55 and 17%M, respectively), especially in the north (near the Ross Sea slope) and in the SW Ross Sea. Amphipods were occasionally important prey items for P. antarcticum (western Ross Sea, 39%M). General concordance between stomach contents and trophic level of P. antarcticum and prey based on d15N was demonstrated. Pleuragramma antarcticum trophic level was estimated as 3.7 (postlarval fish) and 4.1 (fish aged 3+ years).

Impacts on phytoplankton dynamics by free-drifting icebergs in the NW Weddell Sea	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY												Glacier ice released to the oceans through iceberg formation has a complex effect on the surrounding ocean waters. We hypothesized that phytoplankton communities would differ in abundance, composition and production around or close to an iceberg. This paper tests the influence of individual icebergs on scales of meters to kilometers, observed through shipboard oceanographic sampling on March-April 2009. Surface waters (integrated 0-100 m depth, within the euphotic zone) sampled close to the iceberg C-18a ( <1 km) were characterized by lower temperatures, more dissolved nitrate, less total chlorophyll a (chla) concentration, less picoplankton ( <3 mu m) cell abundance, and higher transparency than surface conditions 18 km upstream. However, enrichment of large cells, identified as diatoms, was the basis of an active food chain. Upward velocity of meltwater and dissolved Fe concentrations in excess of 1-2 nM are expected to facilitate diatom specific growth. The presence of diatoms close to the iceberg C-18a and the higher variable fluorescence (Fv/Fm) indicated healthy cells, consistent with Antarctic waters rich in micronutrients. Furthermore, chla increased significantly 2 km around the iceberg and 10 days after the iceberg's passage. We hypothesize that the lower biomass next to the iceberg was due to high loss rates. Underwater melting is expected to dilute phytoplankton near the iceberg by entraining deep water or by introducing meltwater. In addition, high zooplankton biomass within 2 km of the iceberg, mainly Antarctic krill Euphausia superba and salps Salpa thompsonii, are expected to exert heavy grazing pressure on phytoplankton, the krill on large cells >10 mu m and the salps on smaller cells, 3-10 mu m. The iceberg's main influence in the austral fall is measured not so much by phytoplankton accumulation but by reactivation of the classic Antarctic food chain, facilitating diatom growth and sustaining high Antarctic krill populations.

From 25 February to 3 March 2002 a 2150-km Continuous Plankton Recorder (CPR) transect was conducted along 140 degrees E, between 47.02 degrees S and 66.36 degrees S, crossing each of these frontal zones. Surface temperature, salinity, and fluorescence were measured at 1-min intervals in conjunction with CPR samples. Additional physical data for the region south of 61 degrees S was provided by nine CTD stations. Multivariate and Indicator Species analysis of the high resolution (similar to 9.2 km) zooplankton samples identified six distinct assemblages which were strongly correlated with frontal/oceanographic zones. These assemblages appeared to be structured by a combination of zonal differences in water mass structure, phytoplankton regimes, and small scale intra-zonal features (e.g. eddies). The northern branch of the SAF was the strongest biogeographic boundary, separating a high proportion of sub-tropical and temperate species frorn the waters to its south. The Study area differed from other sectors of the Southern Ocean in that the northern PF, equivalent to the PF in other sectors, was not a zone of distinct ecological transition. Two of the identified assemblages were located with the seasonal ice zone, south of the northern SACCF. Although Euphausia superba larvae were a component of both of these assemblages, this species, together with appendicularia, was most abundant south of the SB. The seasonal ice zone north of the SB was dominated by small copepods (Oithona similis and Clenocalanus citer), appendicularia and foraminifera. Although the physical characteristics of the frontal zones can be subtle, the demarcation between zooplankton assemblages was clear. Cross-frontal changes in zooplankton assemblages highlight their role in long-term monitoring programs as indicators of environmental change. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Barrera-Oro, E				Barrera-Oro, E			The role of fish in the Antarctic marine food web: differences between inshore and offshore waters in the southern Scotia Arc and west Antarctic Peninsula	ANTARCTIC SCIENCE												The role of fish in the Antarctic food web in inshore and offshore waters is analysed, taking as an example the coastal marine communities of the southern Scotia Arc (South Orkney Islands and South Shetland Islands) and the west Antarctic Peninsula. Inshore, the ecological role of demersal fish is more important than that of krill. There, demersal fish are major consumers of benthos and also feed on zooplankton (mainly krill in summer). They are links between lower and upper levels of the food web and are common prey of other fish, birds and seats. Offshore, demersal fish depend less on benthos and feed more on zooplankton (mainly krill) and nekton, and are less accessible as prey of birds and seals. There, pelagic fish (especially lantern fish) are more abundant than inshore and play an important role in the energy flow from macrozooplankton to higher trophic levels (seabirds and seals). Through the higher fish predators, energy is transferred to land in the form of fish remains, pellets (birds), regurgitation and faeces (birds and seals). However, in the general context of the Antarctic marine ecosystem, krill (Euphausia superba) plays the central role in the food web because it is the main food source in terms of biomass for most of the high level predators from demersal fish up to whales. This has no obvious equivalent in other marine ecosystems. In Antarctic offshore coastal and oceanic waters the greatest proportion of energy from the ecosystem is transferred to land directly through krill consumers, such as flying birds, penguins, and seals. Beside krill, the populations of fish in the Antarctic Ocean are the second most important element for higher predators, in particular the energy-rich pelagic Myctophidae in open waters and the pelagic Antarctic silver fish (Pleuragramma antarcticum) in the high Antarctic zone. Although the occurrence of these pelagic fish inshore has been poorly documented, their abundance in neritic waters could be higher than previously believed.																	0954-1020					DEC	2002	14	4					293	309		10.1017/S0954102002000111							WOS:000181258200002						
J	WILLIAMS, TD				WILLIAMS, TD			FORAGING ECOLOGY AND DIET OF GENTOO PENGUINS PYGOSCELIS-PAPUA AT SOUTH GEORGIA DURING WINTER AND AN ASSESSMENT OF THEIR WINTER PREY CONSUMPTION	IBIS												Estimates of prey consumption by seabird predators in the Sub-Antarctic have so far been based on data obtained from breeding season studies only. This paper describes the diet, foraging activity and population size of Gentoo Penguins Pygoscelis papua during two austral winters, 1987 and 1988, at Bird Island, South Georgia, and estimates prey consumption by the South Georgia population during winter. Antarctic krill Euphausia superba was the main prey species taken, forming 87% or more (by weight) of the diet in September 1987 and May-September 1988, when the total sample weights were 320-670 g. In July-August 1987, crustaceans formed 87% of the diet of females but fish formed 83% of the diet of males, and total sample weights were about 125-200 g. A greater variety of prey was taken in July-August 1987. These differences may have reflected low availability of krill around South Georgia, within the bird's foraging area, during part of the 1987 winter. Reasons for the sex difference in diet are discussed: Gentoo Penguins show sexual dimorphism in bill size, and males are larger and may be better able to catch fish prey. The main fish species taken were Nototheniops larseni and Champsocephalus gunnari. Mean foraging trip duration (in July) varied between 5.3 and 6.9 hours and foraging trip frequency (trips/day) between 0.76 and 0.83. The estimated minimum weight of all prey consumed in winter by the South Georgia population of 311,266 birds (64% adult, 22% first-years (fledglings )and 14% immatures) was 11.2 x 10(3) and 19.6 x 10(3) tonnes in 1987 and 1988, respectively. This comprised 60% krill, 6% other crustaceans and 34% fish in 1987, and 98% krill and 2% fish in 1988. Adults accounted for 64% of all prey consumed.

MARINE BIOLOGY												The Antarctic fur seal (Arctocephalus gazella) and macaroni penguin (Eudyptes chrysolophus) are sympatric top predators that occur in the Southern Ocean around South Georgia where they are, respectively, the main mammal and bird consumers of Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba). In recent years the population of fur seals has increased, whereas that of macaroni penguins has declined. Both species feed on krill of similar size ranges, dive to similar depths and are restricted in their foraging range at least while provisioning their offspring. In this study we test the hypothesis that the increased fur seal population at South Georgia may have resulted in greater competition for the prey of macaroni penguins, leading to the decline in their population. We used: (1) satellite-tracking data to investigate the spatial separation of the Bird Island populations of these two species whilst at sea during the breeding seasons of 1999 and 2000 and (2) diet data to assess potential changes in their trophic niches between 1989 and 2000. Foraging ranges of the two species showed considerable overlap in both years, but the concentrations of foraging activity were significantly segregated spatially. The size of krill taken by both species was very similar, but over the last 12 years the prevalence of krill in their diets has diverged, with nowadays less krill in the diet of macaroni penguins than in that of Antarctic fur seals. Despite a significant degree of segregation in spatial resource use by the study populations, it is likely that the South Georgia populations of Antarctic fur seal and macaroni penguin exploit the same krill population during their breeding season. For explaining the opposing population trends of the two species, the relative contributions of independent differential response to interannual variation in krill availability and of interspecies competition cannot be resolved with available evidence. The likely competitive advantage of Antarctic fur seals will be enhanced as their population continues to increase, particularly in years of krill scarcity.

Ecological niche modeling of sympatric krill predators around Marguerite Bay, Western Antarctic Peninsula	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY												Adelie penguins (Pygoscelis adeliae), carabeater seals (Lobodon carcinophagus), humpback (Megaptera novaeangliae), and minke whales (Balaenoptera bonaernsis) are found in the waters surrounding the Western Antarctic Peninsula. Each species relies primarily on Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) and has physiological constraints and foraging behaviors that dictate their ecological niches. Understanding the degree of ecological overlap between sympatric krill predators is critical to understanding and predicting the impacts on climate-driven changes to the Antarctic marine ecosystem. To explore ecological relationships amongst sympatric krill predators, we developed ecological niche models using a maximum entropy modeling approach (Maxent) that allows the integration of data collected by a variety of means (e.g. satellite-based locations and visual observations). We created spatially explicit probability distributions for the four krill predators in fall 2001 and 2002 in conjunction with a suite of environmental variables. We find areas within Marguerite Bay with high krill predator occurrence rates or biological hot spots. We find the modeled ecological niches for Adelie penguins and crabeater seals may be affected by their physiological needs to haul-out on substrate. Thus, their distributions may be less dictated by proximity to prey and more so by physical features that over time provide adequate access to prey. Humpback and minke whales, being fully marine and having greater energetic demands, occupy ecological niches more directly proximate to prey. We also find evidence to suggest that the amount of overlap between modeled niches is relatively low, even for species with similar energetic requirements. In a rapidly changing and variable environment, our modeling work shows little indication that krill predators maintain similar ecological niches across years around Marguerite Bay. Given the amount of variability in the marine environment around the Antarctic Peninsula and how this affects the local abundance of prey, there may be consequences for krill predators with historically little niche overlap to increase the potential for interspecific competition for shared prey resources.

J	MURPHY, EJ				MURPHY, EJ			SPATIAL STRUCTURE OF THE SOUTHERN-OCEAN ECOSYSTEM - PREDATOR-PREY LINKAGES IN SOUTHERN-OCEAN FOOD WEBS	JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY												1. The food chain of the Southern Ocean has often been characterized as simple and homogeneous. However, the population processes of a key prey organism, krill Euphausia superba, operate over ocean basin scales and are strongly influenced by large scale abiotic factors. 2. A model was developed in which the local prey abundance was regulated by a continuous, hydrodynamically mediated, supply rate and the concentrating effects of abiotic-biotic interactions. This model was used with estimates of the annual predator demands and the prey concentration for the South Georgia area to investigate the relationship between flow rate and depletion in prey concentration as a function of distance from a predator colony. 3. The model results indicated that concentrating factors need to be large to produce the build-up of krill densities of the order estimated to occur in the South Georgia area, with the peak retention rates required some distance offshore. It was, however, found that, for the estimated supply rates, the region does not need to be an area of particularly high prey concentration to support the estimated predator impact. 4. Differential predator foraging ranges produced a more complex response to the reduction of the abundance of particular predators by harvesting, than in the situation where foraging ranges overlapped completely. In such a system the more inshore foraging predators encountered the greatest changes in prey abundance. 5. Random fluctuations in the interannual prey availability were introduced into the simulation of the flow system. This could lead to apparent population cycling in predator and prey abundance due to the interactive form of the system, although the prey population dynamics were not involved. The system enhanced variability such that inshore foraging predators encountered greater variation in prey supply. 6. The model results emphasize the importance of investigating the magnitude and timing of the horizontal fluxes of secondary production in this spatially distributed ecosystem.																	0021-8790	1365-2656				MAY	1995	64	3					333	347		10.2307/5895							WOS:A1995QZ44600004						
J	RODHOUSE, PG; PRINCE, PA				RODHOUSE, PG; PRINCE, PA			CEPHALOPOD PREY OF THE BLACK-BROWED ALBATROSS DIOMEDEA-MELANOPHRYS AT SOUTH-GEORGIA	POLAR BIOLOGY												Regurgitations were collected from 41 black-browed albatross adults feeding chicks at Bird Island (54-degrees-S 38-degrees-W), South Georgia in February 1986. The samples were sorted into recognisable food categories and weighed. Cephalopods were identified by means of the lower beak, or in some cases the gladius, and allometric equations were used to calculate mantle length and wet body weight represented by beaks. The samples contained 35.5 % Euphausia superba, 30.9 % cephalopods and 27.1 % fish, by weight. A total of 21 samples contained recognisable cephalopod remains and 20 contained specimens that could be identified. In all, 50 cephalopod specimens, representing an estimated 6,866 g wet weight, were identified. The diet was dominated in terms of numbers, weight and percent occurrence by the ommastrephid squid Martialia hyadesi, and in most cases the entire squid was present with only partial digestion of the skin and arm armature. The cranchiid squid Galiteuthis glacialis was the only other cephalopod of numerical importance but no soft parts were present suggesting that, although significant in the diet of the adults, this species was not being fed to chicks. One specimen each of Gonatus antarcticus, Chiroteuthis sp., Histioteuthis sp. B. and the octopodid Pareledone polymorpha were also present. The cephalopod composition of the diet corresponded closely with a collection made 10 years earlier. The commonest species in the bird's diet, M. hyadesi, has not been found in net and jig samples at South Georgia although it has been taken from the Antarctic Polar Frontal Zone to the west of the Island. The presence of almost complete, undigested, specimens of M. hyadesi in the bird's diet indicates that it occurs relatively close to South Georgia. M. hyadesi preys largely on myctophid fishes, which themselves prey on small zooplankters, so a significant component of the black-browed albatross diet depends on a food chain which largely by-passes E. superba.

Spatially Explicit Estimates of Prey Consumption Reveal a New Krill Predator in the Southern Ocean	PLOS ONE												Development in foraging behaviour and dietary intake of many vertebrates are age-structured. Differences in feeding ecology may correlate with ontogenetic shifts in dispersal patterns, and therefore affect foraging habitat and resource utilization. Such life-history traits have important implications in interpreting tropho-dynamic linkages. Stable isotope ratios in the whiskers of sub-yearling southern elephant seals (Mirounga leonina; n = 12) were used, in conjunction with satellite telemetry and environmental data, to examine their foraging habitat and diet during their first foraging migration. The trophic position of seals from Macquarie Island (54 degrees 30'S, 158 degrees 57'E) was estimated using stable carbon (delta C-13) and nitrogen (delta N-15) ratios along the length of the whisker, which provided a temporal record of prey intake. Satellite-relayed data loggers provided details on seal movement patterns, which were related to isotopic concentrations along the whisker. Animals fed in waters south of the Polar Front (>60 degrees S) or within Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR) Statistical Subareas 88.1 and 88.2, as indicated by both their depleted delta C-13 (< -20%) values, and tracking data. They predominantly exploited varying proportions of mesopelagic fish and squid, and crustaceans, such as euphausiids, which have not been reported as a prey item for this species. Comparison of isotopic data between sub-yearlings, and 1, 2 and 3 yr olds indicated that sub-yearlings, limited by their size, dive capabilities and prey capture skills to feeding higher in the water column, fed at a lower trophic level than older seals. This is consistent with the consumption of euphausiids and most probably, Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba), which constitute an abundant, easily accessible source of prey in water masses used by this age class of seals. Isotopic assessment and concurrent tracking of seals are successfully used here to identify ontogenetic shifts in broad-scale foraging habitat use and diet preferences in a highly migratory predator.

Adelie Penguin at Cape Hallett fed on Antarctic krill and Adelie Penguin at Inexpressible Island fed on ice krill and Antarctic silverfish. Emperor Penguins fed on Antarctic silverfish regardless breeding site. Therefore, Adelie Penguin showed regional difference in the diet and Emperor Penguin showed no regional differences in the diet. These diet composition of penguins is affected by competition and distribution of prey, it is important to study the diet of penguins in relation to the sympathetic food sources needed to understand the changes in energy flows and Ross Sea ecosystems due to climate change. To identify the dietary composition and characteristics of both Adelie (Pygoscelis adeliae) and Emperor (Aptenodytes forsteri) penguins at four breeding sites, we performed stable carbon (delta C-13) and nitrogen (delta N-15) isotope analysis of down samples taken from penguin chicks. Adelie Penguin chicks at Cape Hallett mostly fed on Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba; 65.5 +/- 3.5%), a reflection of the prevalence of that species near Cape Hallett, and no significant differences were noted between 2017 and 2018. However, Adelie Penguin chicks at Inexpressible Island, located near Terra Nova Bay, fed on both Antarctic silverfish (Pleuragramma antarctica; 42.5%) and ice krill (Euphausia crystallorophias; 47%), reflecting the high biomass observed in Terra Nova Bay. Meanwhile, no significant difference was noted between the two breeding sites of the Emperor Penguin. Emperor Penguin chicks predominantly fed on Antarctic silverfish (74.5 +/- 2.1%) at both breeding sites (Cape Washington and Coulman Island), suggesting that diet preference represents the main factor influencing Emperor Penguin foraging. In contrast, the diet of the Adelie Penguin reflects presumed regional differences in prey prevalence, as inferred from available survey data.

Ecological zonation	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART I-OCEANOGRAPHIC RESEARCH PAPERS												The composition, distribution, abundance, biomass and size structure of mesozooplankton, collected using Bongo nets in the top 300 m layer along a transect between the Antarctic continent and Cape Town, were investigated during the second South African Antarctic Marine Ecosystem Study (SAAMES II) in Jan.-Feb. 1993. Small (<10 mm) and medium (20-50 mm) size groups of zooplankton consistently dominated across the Southern Ocean. The highest zooplankton densities were recorded at the Antarctic Polar Front (APF) and at the Subtropical Convergence (STC). Minor peaks in zooplankton densities were observed in the southern vicinity of the Subantarctic Front (SAF) and APF. Elevated zooplankton stocks were also found within the Marginal Ice Zone (MIZ) and the Polar Frontal Zone. The lowest densities were recorded in the permanently open zone (MIZ-APF) and in the Subantarctic zone (SAF-STC). Copepods were generally important along the entire transect and formed the bulk of zooplankton stock within the MIZ and in the Polar Frontal Zone (APF-SAF), accounting for at least 40-95% of total abundance and biomass. Euphausiids were also a prominent group along the transect. Their contribution was highest (up to 80% of total biomass) between the MIZ and the APF, mainly because of the occurrence of swarms of the Antarctic krill Euphausia superba. Tunicates, Pyrosoma sp. and Salpa fusiformis, were found in great numbers only in the region of the STC and further north, while Salpa thompsoni was abundant at the southern boundary of the APF. Chaetognaths dominated samples numerically and by mass in the Subantarctic Zone. Results obtained from cluster and ordination analyses show that zooplankton community structure was well correlated with the position of various biogeographical zones separated by the main frontal systems of the Southern Ocean. Two major groupings of stations, separated by the SAF, were identified in these analyses. This front separated the Antarctic and the subantarctic/subtropical assemblages, confirming its important role as a biogeographical boundary. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

(C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.The foraging behaviour of Adelie penguins Pygoscelis adeliae was studied simultaneously at Shirley Island (SI, 110 degrees E) and at Petrel Island (PI, 140 degrees E) in approximate conjunction with the ship-based krill survey conducted on board the RSV Aurora Australis. Acoustic and trawl data were collected near both study sites, albeit at the end of the penguins' breeding season. The distances travelled by Adelie penguins from Shirley Island were significantly greater than those travelled by penguins from Petrel Island (SI 31-144km; PI 6-79km). Mean foraging trip durations and mean maximal distances travelled were also significantly different between colonies (duration: SI guard 55 +/- 32 h, creche 113 +/- 17 h; PI guard 32 +/- 9 h, creche 25 +/- 7 h; distance: SI guard 182 +/- 135km, creche 353 +/- 93km; PI guard 100 +/- 142km, creche 86 +/- 28 km). All penguins foraged over the continental shelf or the shelf break and not in oceanic waters. The percentage distribution of dive depths was similar at both colonies; nearly 70% of all dives were to <35 m. Trawls from the ship contained krill Euphausia superba and E. crystallorophias near SI but only E. superba near PI. Biomass measurements showed that near SI 61% of krill biomass occurred at 63-97 m but the penguins dived to this depth range only 12% of their time; near PI 83% of the biomass was found from 43 to 63 m and 20% of dives reached these depths. The diet of the SI penguins consisted mainly of E. crystallorophias 51-53% by mass), while penguins from PI ingested large amounts of both euphausiids (27-38% E. superba, 27-39% E. crystallorophias). At SI, the remainder of the diet consisted of fish, mainly Pleuragramma antarcticum (26-30%), and amphipods ( ( 1%). Similarly, at PI, fishcontributed 19-37% to the penguins' diet and amphipods constituted 1-3%. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

The mechanism of Krill oil function is not clear yet and research reports on the absorption rate of the phospholipids of krill oil in the blood and brain are very poor. Methods: We studied the effect of oral short-term and long-term administration of Krill oils (KOs) on bioavailability in the blood and brain of rats. For short-term testing of fish and KO bioavailability, rats were divided into four groups: normal, fish oil (FO), Krill oil 1 (KO), and Krill oil 2 (CKO). The blood and brain were collected at 2, 4, 8, 12, 24, and 48 h after oral administration (1000 mg/rat). Five hundred milligrams of FO, KO, and CKO were orally administered daily for 2 weeks for long-term administration, and then the brain and blood were collected. Results: Two types of KOs showed high content of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) in the PL. The EPA content of CKO and KO were 41.13 and 32.49%, respectively. After short-term KO administration, KO showed a higher EPA content than CKO in the blood after 2 h. KO showed higher content of DHA than CKO even after 2 h. FO increased until 8 h, but then decreased rapidly until 12 h. Although the total unsaturated fatty acid (UFA) content of KOs was lower than the total UFS content in FO, the remaining UFS content in the brain was higher than that in FO over time. Following oral administration of FO, KO, and CKO for 1 and 2 weeks, triglycerides (TG) and PL contents in the blood for KOs were slightly higher than for FO. EPA and DHA levels in the brain were slightly higher in KOs following long-term administration, but the difference was not significant. Conclusions: Base on these findings, KOs have functional potential for the brain and vascular diseases, and can be utilized as a multi-functional material composed mainly of functional ingredients.

Despite studies dating from the beginning of the last century, the causes of the high productivity remain unclear. The island lies within the Antarctic Zone of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current, to the south of the Polar Front. The offshore waters to its north and east are affected by a northwards deflection of the Southern Antarctic Circumpolar Current Front, together with waters from the Weddell-Scotia Confluence, Despite a retentive circulation over the shelf, the high productivity of phytoplankton and copepods is widespread, occurring far downstream and possibly extending to the Polar Front. High phytoplankton concentrations (> 20 mg chlorophyll a m(-3)) may be linked to enhanced supply of iron or reduced forms of nitrogen (up to similar to3 mmol ammonium m(-3)). Although macronutrients are generally not limiting in the Antarctic Zone, silicate concentrations of < 1 mmol m(-3) are growth-limiting at South Georgia in some summers, The growth season is long and blooms of > 2 mg chl a m(-3) occur for 4 to 5 mo. Biomass of krill plus net-caught zooplankton in summer is around 15 to 20 g dry mass m(-2), equally dominated by krill and copepods. This greatly exceeds typical values for Antarctica, and is high compared to productive northern shelves, Zooplankton, and in particular krill, appear to have a pivotal role in regulating energy flow in this food web, through selective grazing and possibly also through nutrient regeneration. Abundances of krill and copepods are negatively related across a wide range of scales, suggesting direct interaction through competition or predation. Evidence suggests that when phytoplankton stocks are low, energy flow through krill is maintained by their feeding on the large populations of small copepods. Metazoans and higher predators at South Georgia can feed across several trophic levels according to prey abundance, and they regenerate substantial quantities of reduced nitrogen. Therefore we suggest that these groups have a controlling influence an lower trophic levels, both stabilising population sizes and maintaining high rates of energy flow. Hydrography, nutrient concentrations, phytoplankton, copepod, and krill biomasses fluctuate between years. Periodically (once or twice a decade), shortages of krill in summer result in breeding failures among many of their predators, This appears to be a downstream effect from wider scale, Scotia Sea phenomena, although the processes involved are unclear. The elevated biomass and energy flows at South Georgia appear to be caused by locally enhanced growth rates; there is no evidence so far for any physical concentration mechanism. Even for krill, which do not breed there, local growth rates are probably of a similar order to the biomass removed by their main land-based predators in summer. Thus the transfer of energy to higher predators depends on local enhancement of fluxes through the food web as well as the supply of plankton to the island by the Antarctic Circumpolar Current.

Sexual differentiation, gonad maturation, and reproduction of the Southern Ocean euphausiid Thysanoessa macrura (Sars, 1883) (Crustacea: Euphausiacea)	JOURNAL OF CRUSTACEAN BIOLOGY												Thysanoessa macrura (Sars, 1883) is a small, albeit highly abundant, Southern Ocean euphausiid. It has been reported that T. macrura reproduces during late winter, with the reproductive cycle decoupled from periods of high primary productivity in the highly seasonal Southern Ocean. Despite this uncommon reproductive strategy, there has been little work to describe this cycle and quantify the reproductive potential of this species. Thysanoessa macrura collected from Antarctic waters during early September to early October 2007 were used to establish sexual developmental stages, for females and males, to provide a standard means for assessing the reproductive maturity of this species. Seven sexual developmental stages were established for females based upon the organisation of ovaries and their constituent oogonia and oocytes. Four sexual developmental stages were identified in males using secondary sexual characters. A large lipid deposit was identified in the carapace of both sexes, reducing in size with progressive gonadal development, likely fuelling egg and sperm production. Egg-batch size was determined by direct ovarian counts and scaled allometrically with total wet weight. Predicted egg-batch size ranged from 34 to 746 eggs batch(-1) for the range of individual sizes studied (30.5-165.6 mg). Using the ratios of the different oocytes remaining after the first-spawning event of females, it was predicted that up to three egg batches can be produced by T. macrura in a single reproductive season. Consequently, the fecundity of T. macrura is estimated at 60 to > 2200 eggs female(-1) year(-1). A model of T. macrura reproductive cycle confirms a winter reproductive period and further highlights the reproductive potential of this small-size Southern Ocean euphausiid, providing the first estimates of fecundity reported for this species.

When samples for all years were combined, cephalopods and crustaceans were the main components in the diet of Grey-headed and Black-browed Albatrosses, respectively. However, their diets exhibited interannual variations. Cephalopods were the most important component in the diet of Grey-headed Albatrosses between 1996 and 1999 (60-75% by mass) but decreased significantly in 2000 (17%), when crustaceans dominated (61%). The Black-browed Albatross diet varied greatly, with cephalopods being the most important component in 1996 (49% by mass) and 1997 (48%), fish in 1998 (32%) and 1999 (40%), and crustaceans in 2000 (63%). In 1998 and 2000 there was a significant change in the cephalopod species present in the diet of both albatross species, when their breeding success was low. The consumption of the ommastrephid Martialia hyadesi was significantly and positively correlated with Grey-headed Albatross breeding success. For Black-browed Albatrosses significant correlations were found between its consumption of the Icefish Champsocephalus gunnari and breeding success, and between its consumption of M. hyadesi and M. hyadesi CPUE (Catch per Unit Effort). These findings suggest that Grey-headed Albatrosses are more reliant on Antarctic Polar Frontal Zone prey (M. hyadesi and Lamprey Geotria australis) whereas Black-browed Albatrosses are more dependent on Antarctic prey (Icefish and Antarctic Krill Euphausia superba). The differences between diets of Grey-headed and Black-browed Albatrosses breeding on different islands of the Southern Ocean showed that Grey-headed Albatrosses feed more on oceanic cephalopods (e.g. M. hyadesi) whereas Black-browed Albatrosses feed primarily on shelf fish (e.g. Blue Whiting Micromesistius australis), suggesting that albatross diets are likely to be influenced by the geographical position of those islands, albatross foraging preference and prey availability.					/0000-0002-9621-6660												0019-1019					OCT	2003	145	4					593	610		10.1046/j.1474-919X.2003.00196.x							WOS:000185657700006

The influence of warmer Atlantic water in Kongsfjorden was indicated by the findings of three additional euphausiid species of typically Atlantic origin, relative to the previous study 10 years ago. The predominant presence of Thysanoessa inermis in Hornsund suggested persisting cold conditions in this more southerly, but more Arctic influenced fjord. In this species, moult stage analysis showed that trophic effects can override temperature forcing. Histology and lipid analysis suggest that reproductive activity should be monitored as an indication of warming and possibly a shift in food web composition.

Shrimp were reared in tanks for three months, fed either salmon feed or cod, and the fatty acid profile of their muscle tissue was monitored. The salmon feed pellets and cod had completely different fatty acid compositions, with significant differences in most of the analysed fatty acids, eight of them, 14:0, iso 16:0, 16:1n7. 16:2n11, 18:3n3, 20:0, 22:0 and 22:1n11, differing between the two diets by a factor of 10 or more. The levels of the fatty acids in the diets differed also substantially from the levels in the shrimp tissue at the start of the experiment. The shrimp were fed ad libitum and both groups increased significantly in total fatty acid content in the course of the experiment. Nevertheless, the fatty acids made up no more than 6.5 mg g(-1) muscle tissue, with 88 +/- 1% of them bound in polar, membrane lipids. Their composition in the tissue did also change to a certain extent, but the resulting tissue composition did not reflect the fatty acid composition of the diets. Only two fatty acids, 18:2n6 and 18:3n3, clearly followed the dietary level. They are abundant in commercial salmon feed since they are rich in plant oils used as additives to the commercial feed. Determination of fatty acid levels in shrimp tissue may enable shrimp to be used as indicator organisms for the influence of organic fish-farm waste on the food web in adjacent areas.

Horizontal and vertical distribution of euphausiid species on the Western Antarctic Peninsula U.S. GLOBEC Southern Ocean study site	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY												The Western Antarctic Peninsula (WAP) is a site of high krill abundance and a likely source region for krill populations found to the north and east of the area. The U.S. GLOBEC Southern Ocean program studied factors that contribute to the overwintering success of krill in the region of Marguerite Bay, WAP. A MOCNESS net system was used to sample the vertical distribution and abundance of zooplankton relative to physical features (hydrography and circulation) during four broad-scale survey cruises in the fall and winter of 2001 and 2002. Four species were found throughout the study area on all four cruises: Euphausia superba, Euphausia crystallorophias. Euphausia triacantha, and Thysanoessa macrura. The species had significantly different horizontal and vertical distributions. Both E. superba and T. macrura were broadly distributed throughout the area, but the central 50% of their vertical distributions were distinct with E. superba most abundant in the upper 100 m in the coldest, freshest water (average temperature and salinity: -1.13 degrees C; 33.80) and T. macrura occurring between 100 and 250 m (at 0.01 degrees C; 34.228). E. crystailorophias had a more coastal distribution and was usually found deeper in slightly warmer and saltier water (-0.44 degrees C; 33.9982) than E. superba and either overlapped or was above T. macrura in depth. E. triacantha was much rarer and sporadically distributed in the study area and was found substantially deeper (center of distribution about 300 m) in the warmest saltiest water (1.40 degrees C; 34.65) than the other three euphausiid species. Larval distributions for E. superba indicated that at least some proportion of the populations resulted from reproduction and development on the continental shelf, and not solely from offshore reproduction and transport onto the shelf. A neutral particle tracking model was used to gain insight into the relative importance of shelf versus off-shelf origins for the larvae. The results suggest that a combination of offshore and onshore reproduction can account for the observed E. superba larval distributions in the U.S. SO GLOBEC study site. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Maud Rise - a snapshot through the water column	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY												The benthic fauna was investigated during the expedition ANT-XXIV/2 (2007/08) in relation to oceanographic features, biogeochemical properties and sediment characteristics, as well as the benthic, pelagic and air-breathing fauna. The results document that Maud Rise (MR) differs distinctly from surrounding deep-sea basins investigated during previous Southern Ocean expeditions (ANDEEP 2002, 2005). Considering all taxa, the overall similarity between MR and adjacent stations was low (similar to 20% Bray-Curtis-Similarity), and analyses of single taxa show obvious differences in species composition, abundances and densities. The composition and diversity of bivalves of MR are characterised by extremely high abundances of three species, especially the small sized Vesicomya spp. Exceptionally high gastropod abundance at MR is due to the single species Onoba subantarctica wilkesiana, a small brooder that may prey upon abundant benthic foraminiferas. The abundance and diversity of isopods also show that one family. Haplomunnidae, occurs with a surprisingly high number of individuals at MR while this family was not found at any of the 40 bathyal and abyssal ANDEEP stations. Similarly, polychaetes, especially the tube-dwelling, suspension-feeder fraction, are represented by species not found at the comparison stations. Sponges comprise almost exclusively small specimens in relatively high numbers, especially a few species of Polymastiidae. Water-column sampling from the surface to the seafloor, including observations of top predators, indicate the existence of a prospering pelagic food web. Local concentrations of top predators and zooplankton are associated with a rich ice-edge bloom located over the northern slope of MR. There the sea ice melts, which is probably accelerated by the advection of warm water at intermediate depth. Over the southern slope, high concentrations of Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) occur under dense sea ice and attract Antarctic Minke Whales (Balaenoptera bonaerensis) and several seabird species. These findings suggest that biological prosperity over MR is related to both oceanographic and sea-ice processes. Downward transport of the organic matter produced in the pelagic realm may be more constant than elsewhere due to low lateral drift over MR. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Reid, K; Sims, M; White, RW; Gillon, KW				Reid, K; Sims, M; White, RW; Gillon, KW			Spatial distribution of predator/prey interactions in the Scotia Sea: implications for measuring predator/fisheries overlap	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY												The measurement of spatial overlap between predators and fisheries exploiting a common prey source is dependent upon the measurement scale used; inappropriate scales may produce misleading results. Previous assessments of the level of overlap between predators and fisheries for Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) in the region of the South Shetland Islands used different measurement scales and arrived at contradictory conclusions. At-sea data from observations of krill predators during the CCAMLR 2000 Survey were used to identify the areas of potential overlap with fisheries in the Scotia Sea and to determine the scale at which such overlap should be measured. The relationship between autocorrelation and sampling distance was used to identify the characteristic scales of the distribution of predators, krill and krill fisheries, and an effort-corrected index of relative abundance as a function of distance from land was used to identify the characteristics of areas of high potential for overlap. Despite distinct differences in foraging ecology, a group of krill-dependent species including chinstrap penguin (Pygoscelis antarctica), (Antarctic) fur seal (Arctocephalus sp. (gazella)) and white-chinned petrel (Procellaria aequinoctialis) showed similar patterns of distribution; the relative abundances were highest at 60-120 km from land and decreased sharply at distances greater than 150 km from land. There were more inter-specific differences in the characteristic scales, which were of the order of 50-100 km. Antarctic krill had a characteristic scale of approximately 200 km and the relationship with distance from land showed a log-linear decline. Krill fisheries operate at a scale of 150 km and occur almost entirely within 100 km of land. The requirement of land for breeding and the biological and oceanographic conditions that produce the high concentrations of krill associated with those land areas produce a system in which the demand for Antarctic krill from fisheries and predators is essentially co-extensive. The areas of greatest potential overlap are within 150-200 km of land and to accommodate the scales of operation of the processes involved the extent of such overlap in these areas should be assessed at scales of 70-100 km.

Advancing the Sea Ice Hypothesis: Trophic Interactions Among Breeding Pygoscelis Penguins With Divergent Population Trends Throughout the Western Antarctic Peninsula	FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE												We evaluated annual and regional variation in the dietary niche of Pygoscelis penguins including the sea ice-obligate Adelie penguin (Pygoscelis adeliae), and sea ice-intolerant chinstrap (Pygoscelis antarcticus) and gentoo (Pygoscelis papua) penguins, three species that nest throughout the western Antarctic Peninsula (AP) to test the sea ice trophic interaction hypothesis, which posits that penguin breeding populations with divergent trends, i.e., declining or increasing, are reliant on differing food webs. Our study relies on values of naturally occurring carbon (C-13/C-12, delta C-13) and nitrogen (N-15/N-14, delta N-15) stable isotopes as integrated proxies of penguin food webs measured over three years at three different breeding colonies. At Anvers Island in the north, where reductions in sea ice and changes in breeding population trends among sympatric sea ice-obligate (Adelie) and sea ice-intolerant (chinstrap and gentoo) penguins have been most notable, our analyses show that all three species of Pygoscelis penguins became more similar isotopically over the reproductive period. By late chick-rearing at Anvers Island, creched chicks at 5-weeks-old for all species occupied similar trophic positions. Isotopic mixing models indicated that the proportions of prey provisioned by adult penguins to 5-week-old chicks at Anvers Island were generally similar across species within years, consisting primarily of Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba). Creched Adelie chicks had higher delta C-13 and delta N-15 values at Avian and Charcot Islands, southern breeding colonies where sea ice is more prominent and populations of Adelie penguins have increased or remain stable. Trophic position increased with latitude, while the proportions of prey provisioned by Adelie penguin adults to chicks at southern breeding colonies included species typical of high Antarctic marine food webs, especially crystal krill (Euphausia crystallorophias). A Bayesian metric for dietary niche width, standard ellipse area (SEA-B), indicated that Pygoscelis penguins with greater population changes in the north had more variability in dietary niche width than stable populations further south. Our results lend insight on marine food web drivers of Pygoscelis penguin reproduction at the regional scale and question the long-standing paradigm that Antarctic krill are the only food web component critical to penguin reproductive survival in this region of the Southern Ocean.</p>					Gorman, Kristen B./0000-0002-0258-9264													2296-7745				SEP 8	2021	8								526092	10.3389/fmars.2021.526092							WOS:000697678100001						
J	Quillfeldt, P; McGill, RAR; Furness, RW				Quillfeldt, P; McGill, RAR; Furness, RW			Diet and foraging areas of Southern Ocean seabirds and their prey inferred from stable isotopes: review and case study of Wilson's storm-petrel	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												Analysis of stable isotope ratios in animal tissues has emerged as a powerful tool for determining the trophic level and composition of prey and foraging location. We summarize here data on the stepwise trophic enrichment in delta(15) N and latitudinal gradient in delta C-13 in the Southern Ocean, and derive a regression equation to estimate latitudes from delta C-13 values. We analysed isotope ratios of feathers of the small, pelagic seabird Wilson's storm-petrel Oceanites oceanicus, in different breeding stages, in comparison to isotope ratios of 4 other seabird species breeding in close vicinity on King George Island, South Shetland Islands. 615 N analysis of feathers and albumen from Wilson's storm-petrels indicated a shift in diet from mainly crustaceans during egg formation to an increased proportion of fish during chick-feeding and moulting. 615 N values of Wilson's storm-petrels during the chick-rearing season were closer to the mainly piscivorous-carnivorous skuas than to krill-feeding penguins, confirming that fish is an important part of their diet. VC analysis of feathers identified 4 distinct foraging areas: VC values in egg-white suggest that egg-forming females moved south to the sea ice edge. This coincides with the distribution of their main prey, Antarctic krill Euphausia superba, during this period. During the breeding season, Wilson's storm-petrels fed in the area around the colony, which is also used by penguins and skuas. VC of the feathers indicate that adults migrated to the Subtropical Front and beyond (north of 44 degrees S) during the inter-breeding period. Feathers were also analysed from 10 Wilson's storm-petrels caught by mistnet and thought to be prebreeders because they lacked foot markings; 8 of these had moulted in the same area as breeding birds, while 2 birds had moulted in an area further north (north of 30 degrees S). Adelie penguins Pygoscelis adeliae and Gentoo penguins F papua had significantly different VC, suggesting that the Adelie penguins foraged further south than the Gentoo penguins. The foraging areas of brown skuas Stercorarius antarctica and south polar skuas S. maccormicki could not be separated by their isotope ratios.

J	Tremblay, N; Hunerlage, K; Werner, T				Tremblay, Nelly; Huenerlage, Kim; Werner, Thorsten			Hypoxia Tolerance of 10 Euphausiid Species in Relation to Vertical Temperature and Oxygen Gradients	FRONTIERS IN PHYSIOLOGY												Oxygen Minimum Zones prevail in most of the world's oceans and are particularly extensive in Eastern Boundary Upwelling Ecosystems such as the Humboldt and the Benguela upwelling systems. In these regions, euphausiids are an important trophic link between primary producers and higher trophic levels. The species are known as pronounced diel vertical migrators, thus facing different levels of oxygen and temperature within a 24 h cycle. Declining oxygen levels may lead to vertically constrained habitats in euphausiids, which consequently will affect several trophic levels in the food web of the respective ecosystem. By using the regulation index (RI), the present study aimed at investigating the hypoxia tolerances of different euphausiid species from Atlantic, Pacific as well as from Polar regions. RI was calculated from 141 data sets and used to differentiate between respiration strategies using median and quartile (Q) values: low degree of oxyregulation (0.25 < RI median < 0.5); high degree of oxyregulation (0.5 < RI median < 1; Q1 > 0.25 or Q3 > 0.75); and metabolic suppression (RI median, Q1 and Q3 < 0). RI values of the polar (Euphausia superba, Thysanoessa inermis) and sub-tropical (Euphausia hanseni, Nyctiphanes capensis, and Nematoscelis megalops) species indicate a high degree of oxyregulation, whereas almost perfect oxyconformity (RI median approximate to 0; Q1 < 0 and Q3 > 0) was identified for the neritic temperate species Thysanoessa spinifera and the tropical species Euphausia lamelligera. RI values of Euphausia distinguenda and the Humboldt species Euphausia mucronata qualified these as metabolic suppressors. RI showed a significant impact of temperature on the respiration strategy of E. hanseni from oxyregulation to metabolic suppression. The species' estimated hypoxia tolerances and the degree of oxyconformity vs. oxyregulation were linked to diel vertical migration behavior and the temperature experienced during migration. The results highlight that the euphausiid species investigated have evolved various strategies to deal with different levels of oxygen, ranging from species showing a high degree of oxyconformity to strong oxyregulation. Neritic species may be more affected by hypoxia, as these are often short-distance-migrators and only adapted to a narrow range of environmental conditions.				, Nelly/K-2552-2014	, Nelly/0000-0002-8221-4680												1664-042X					MAR 24	2020	11								248	10.3389/fphys.2020.00248							WOS:000597669800001	32265739					
J	Constable, AJ				Constable, AJ			CCAMLR ecosystem monitoring and management: Future work	CCAMLR SCIENCE												Harvesting of marine living resources in the Southern Ocean is managed by the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR). CCAMLR is widely known for its ecosystem approach to managing fisheries with the maintenance of ecological relationships included in the conservation objectives. In the late 1980s, CCAMLR's precautionary approach was developed, incorporating principles of how to use scientific evidence in the decision-making process. Even though this approach was based on the management of a single species (Antarctic krill, Euphausia superba), it takes account of the needs of predators in the assessment of catch limits. The success of this process is due to the formulation of a management procedure which includes decision rules that specify how harvest controls will be adjusted based on the scientific information available and the assessments that arise from such information. To assist the Commission in meeting its objectives, the CCAMLR Ecosystem Monitoring Program (CEMP) was set up to detect the effects of fishing on krill predators. CCAMLR needs to adopt a management procedure which has a good chance of maintaining ecological relationships and meeting the needs of predators, incorporating: (i) operational objectives that articulate the target conditions of relevant aspects of the system, (ii) methods for assessing the status of the system, (iii) decision rules on how to adjust harvest controls given the difference between the assessment and the agreed objectives, and (iv) methods for dealing with uncertainty. This paper reviews progress in developing ecosystem-based management procedures by summarising the gaps in the existing approach, the types of models developed for the Antarctic marine ecosystem, the implications of the large scale of the fishery for designing a monitoring program to detect the effects of fishing, and the types of procedures already proposed for management of the krill fishery. It highlights the need to focus future work in these areas, including the need to evaluate candidate management procedures in advance of the expansion of the krill fishery. Most importantly, operational objectives for dependent species and feasible management options need to be clearly articulated to guide this work.																	1023-4063						2002	9						233	253									WOS:000179438500016

The role of lipids during embryonic development of the euphausiids Euphausia pacifica and Thysanoessa spinifera	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												To understand the role of lipids during early embryogenesis, major lipid classes together with individual fatty-acid and sterol composition were determined in embryos from multiple developmental stages of the euphausiids Euphausia pacifica and Thysanoessa spinifera. Average lipid content in embryos of E. pacifica and T. spinifera from the earliest stage (multicell) were 4.45 and 3.69 mu g embryo(-1), respectively. During development, the lipid content decreased at similar rates in the embryos of both species. In contrast to many crustacean eggs, phospholipids were the dominant lipid class in all embryonic stages, with decreasing concentrations seen during development. Individual fatty acids and sterols showed selective utilization during early developmental stages. The dominant fatty acids were 16:0 and 16:1 omega 7 and 20:5 omega 3, with most polyunsaturated fatty acids preferentially metabolized throughout early stages. An exception was 22:6 omega 3, which remained near constant through all stages. Cholesterol was the dominant sterol (> 82% of total sterols) in embryos, with only minor changes during development. The appearance of algal sterols and fatty alcohols, including phytol, in T. spinifera embryos suggests that considerable amounts of algal lipids are directly allocated to eggs during vitellogenesis. Despite the substantial changes in lipid amount and composition during embryo development, the presence of phospholipids as the dominate lipid store acts to moderate changes in egg-sinking rate for both species until the late (early and late limb-bud) stages of development.

Assessing the structure and temporal dynamics of seabird communities: the challenge of capturing marine ecosystem complexity	JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY												1. Understanding interspecific interactions, and the influences of anthropogenic disturbance and environmental change on communities, are key challenges in ecology. Despite the pressing need to understand these fundamental drivers of community structure and dynamics, only 17% of ecological studies conducted over the past three decades have been at the community level. 2. Here, we assess the trophic structure of the procellariiform community breeding at South Georgia, to identify the factors that determine foraging niches and possible temporal changes. We collected conventional diet data from 13 sympatric species between 1974 and 2002, and quantified intra-and inter-guild, and annual variation in diet between and within foraging habits. In addition, we tested the reliability of stable isotope analysis (SIA) of seabird feathers collected over a 13-year period, in relation to those of their potential prey, as a tool to assess community structure when diets are diverse and there is high spatial heterogeneity in environmental baselines. 3. Our results using conventional diet data identified a four-guild community structure, distinguishing species that mainly feed on crustaceans; large fish and squid; a mixture of crustaceans, small fish and squid; or carrion. In total, Antarctic krill Euphausia superba represented 32%, and 14 other species a further 46% of the combined diet of all 13 predators, underlining the reliance of this community on relatively few types of prey. Annual variation in trophic segregation depended on relative prey availability; however, our data did not provide evidence of changes in guild structure associated with a suggested decline in Antarctic krill abundance over the past 40 years. 4. Reflecting the differences in delta N-15 of potential prey (crustaceans vs. squid vs. fish and carrion), analysis of delta N-15 in chick feathers identified a three-guild community structure that was constant over a 13-year period, but lacked the trophic cluster representing giant petrels which was identified using conventional diet data. 5. Our study is the first in recent decades to examine dietary changes in seabird communities over time. Conventional dietary analysis provided better resolution of community structure than SIA. However, delta N-15 in chick feathers, which reflected trophic (level) specialization, was nevertheless an effective and less time-consuming means of monitoring temporal changes.

The intent was to subdivide the precautionary catch limit for krill among the SSMUs so as to preclude the inadvertent concentration of catches in a small portion of the surveyed area. Five options for allocating the catch limit among the SSMUs in the Scotia Sea are presented in this paper. The first four are static allocations where the allotment of catch to an SSMU is proportional to: (i) the historical catch within the SSMU; (ii) estimated predator demand in the SSMU; (iii) estimated standing stock of krill in the SSMU; and (iv) standing stock less predator demand in the SSMU. The fifth option is a dynamic allocation based on land-based predator monitoring conducted just prior to, or early in, the fishing season. For the purposes of illustration and comparison between the options, parameter estimates are made using available data, although it is recognised that considerable refinement of these estimates is possible. Qualitative conclusions are that: under the first two options a substantial portion (>65%) of the catch limit would be allocated to three or less of the SSMUs adjacent to large concentrations of land-breeding predators; under options (iii) and (iv) a similar portion of the catch limit would be directed to pelagic SSMUs beyond the foraging range of these predators but into areas where krill fishing has not regularly occurred; and under option (v), an example of an adjustable catch limit dependent on the results of ecosystem monitoring, the fishery would be restricted in some of its traditional fishing grounds during years of low krill availability. Under all five options there would be little effect on the existing fishery However, as catches increase, a trade-off may be drawn between options that displace the fishery from its current operating area, but reduce the potential for contravening the terms of the Convention, and options that do not displace the fishery, but are likely to contravene the terms of the CCAMLR Convention.																	1023-4063						2004	11						81	97									WOS:000225324900005

Fatty acid composition and volatile compounds of selected marine oils and meals	JOURNAL OF THE SCIENCE OF FOOD AND AGRICULTURE												BACKGROUND: Although volatile compounds characterising seafood have been studied extensively, no similar data are available regarding the volatiles of raw materials used in fish feed. Therefore the aim of this study was to make an initial screening of the volatiles of various common marine raw materials used in the aquaculture feed industry. Nine commercial marine oils (German (GFO1, GFO2 and GFO3) and Norwegian (NFO) fish oils and salmon (SO1 and SO2), tuna (TO), sardine (SRDO) and shrimp (SHO) oils) and eight commercial marine meals (Peruvian (PFM1 and PFM2), Danish (DFM1 and DFM2) and prime quality (PQFM1 and PQFM2) fish meals and Antarctic krill meals (KM1 and KM2)) were analysed for their fatty acid profiles and volatile flavour compounds. The relation between fatty acids and volatiles was examined. RESULTS: The highest polyunsaturated fatty acid and eicosapentaenoic acid (20:5 omega 3) contents and omega 3/omega 6 ratio were found in NFO. The fatty acid composition of all marine meals except krill meals was found to be more variable among batches than that of marine oils. Regarding volatiles, all marine raw materials were characterised by the complete absence or negligible levels of eight- and nine-carbon alcohols and carbonyls. All marine oils were found to have high 2-ethyl furan, 2-methylenebutyl cyclopropane, hexanal, 2,4-octadiene and 3,5-octadiene contents. Marine meals, unlike marine oils, were characterised by the almost complete absence of unsaturated and cyclic hydrocarbons and terpenes and very low levels of furans. CONCLUSION: Volatiles of marine meals differ from those of marine oils. Unlike fatty acids which give useful traceability information, volatiles seem to fail in this role owing to their strong variability. 2008 Society of Chemical Industry				Grigorakis, Kriton/H-6321-2019	Grigorakis, Kriton/0000-0002-3367-7160												0022-5142	1097-0010				JAN 15	2009	89	1					88	100		10.1002/jsfa.3414							WOS:000261773500012

TARGET STRENGTH STUDIES ON ANTARCTIC SILVERFISH (PLEURAGRAMMA ANTARCTICUM) IN THE ROSS SEA	CCAMLR SCIENCE												Target strength (TS) of preserved (frozen and defrosted) Antarctic silverfish (Pleuragramma antarcticum) of total length (TL) from 110 to 202.5 mm were measured ex situ (Ancona Bay) at 38, 120 and 200 kHz in May 2007 and in February 2009. Overall ex situ TS TL relationships were: TS38 = 36.83Log TL(cm) -103.62 (N = 18); TS120 = 34.75Log TL(cm) -84.20 (N = 19); TS200 = 26.71Log TL(cm) -73.74; (N = 16). Nine in situ acoustic trawl experiments targeted at juveniles and post-larvae of P. antarcticum with a total length from 13 to 70 mm, were conducted in the southeast of the continental slope and shelf of the Ross Sea at depths from 30 to 120 m, during the Italian expeditions of 1997/98, 2000 and 2004. The regression lines for estimating TS from nine experiments were: TS38 = 57.58Log TL(cm) -123.77; TS120 = 51.94Log TL(cm) -105.92; TS200 = 46.61 Log TL(cm) -95.29. These results indicate that the TS-TL relationships at 38, 120 and 200 kHz of adults of P. antarcticum differ consistently from those of post-larvae and juveniles. However, a simple model derived from the geometrical and acoustic characteristics of different parts of adult P. antarcticum and designed to fit fish life stages from adults to post-larvae and frequencies from 38 to 200 kHz, can predict the experimental TS measured both ex situ and in situ with a mean difference <1.5 dB, although the differences between the predicted and measured TS at some fish lengths were high (from 7.16 to -3.14 dB). The model shows that the main contribution to the scattering for small fish is from soft tissues and for larger sizes from hard tissues (e.g. skeletal structures). This may explain why small and large fish have different TS-TL relationships. In the authors' opinion the model could be used to give a first indication of the absolute abundance of P. antarcticum in the Ross Sea. A critical point is the decision rule to be used to differentiate P. antarcticum from Euphausia superba and E. crystallorophias that are present in the same region of the Ross Sea. Following the three-frequency decision criterion described in Azzali et al. (2004), some sizes of P. antarcticum could be confused acoustically with E. crystallorophias, but not with E. superba.

The ecological relevance of differences in tissue isotopes within and between individuals in the context of foraging however depends on understanding tissue turnover times and carbon (Delta C-13) and nitrogen (Delta N-15) discrimination, which can vary with physiology, metabolism, and diet quality. Here, we examine isotope dynamics in captive R. typus as a basis for enhanced ecological insights into wild populations of the world's largest fish and other enigmatic species. A variable diet, principally consisting of two krill (Euphausia pacifica and Euphausia superba) provided an average of 48 +/- 20 MJ/d (mean +/- SD), or 2.7 +/- 1.3 times basal metabolic requirements. On this diet, in agreement with allometric relationships, large body sizes (3,000-4,000 kg) were matched by slow plasma and cartilage turnover rates (empirically derived as 9 months and 3 yr, respectively), which provide tissue-specific limits on the timescales over which we can isotopically detect diet changes in this species. Average diet-to-tissue discrimination showed significant variation between tissues (plasma and cartilage), and among growing and fasting individuals (Delta C-13 range, 1.5 to 5.5 parts per thousand; Delta N-15 range, -0.1 to 2.9 parts per thousand). Assimilation rates increased with temperature and were higher for the smaller E. pacifica (15 +/- 2 mm) than E. superba (48 +/- 2 mm). Growth significantly lowered both Delta N-15(plasma) and Delta N-15(cartilage), with inappetence markedly reducing Delta N-15(plasma) and Delta C-13(plasma), as well as significantly altering blood biochemistry. Captive findings facilitated the first robust multi-tissue growth- and nutrition-corrected isotope analysis of a wild R. typus population, suggesting individual foraging specialization on low trophic level mid-ocean or coastal prey. Long-term fasting during ocean-basin-scale migrations may be common and such metabolic effects should be carefully quantified when isotopically assessing intra-species foraging differences. The metabolically constrained multi-tissue, multi-isotope approach described can facilitate ecological insights that are indispensable for effective conservation and management of globally threatened, but poorly understood, species by identifying differences in key foraging areas and target prey within and between individuals.

The food spectrum in the stomachs was analysed using traditional taxonomic methods and biochemical techniques. The vertical migration behaviour of krill was monitored through a 30 h series of net samples, whilst the trophic environment was characterised through accompanying quantitative analyses on the depth distribution and biomass of copepods and phytoplankton. Krill was found to be more carnivorous in the Kattegat than in the Clyde Sea, which correlated with the higher ratio of copepod to phytoplankton biomass found in the Kattegat compared with the Clyde Sea. High levels of fatty alcohols and other lipid markers in the stomach contents of Kattegat krill were also indicative of a carnivorous diet. Other food sources included detritus, terrestrial material and other euphausiids, underlining the opportunistic nature of northern krill in its choice of prey items. Analyses of stomach and intestinal fullness over a diel cycle showed significant variations with time in the Clyde Sea but not in the Kattegat. However, a diel cycle in the rate of ingestion was evident at both locations when comparing the copepod mandibles in the stomachs to the distribution of copepods in the environment. The fact that deep-living Calanus was not a major prey item suggested that there was little feeding activity during the daytime, when the krill occupied the deeper layers. Instead. the majority of mandibles were from species that were dominant in the upper layers, e.g, the genera Temora and Pseudocalanus. The fact that kriIl caught in the daytime contained the same relative composition of mandibles in the stomach as those caught at night is probably explained by a cessation in daytime feeding activity and retention of the mandibles from the night before. It is proposed that krill in the Clyde Sea area and the Kattegat show a diel rhythm in feeding activity that is believed to be an adaptive response to minimising predation risk.

CCAMLR SCIENCE												This paper explains the management of the Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) fishery in the Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean, and current knowledge about the state of the regional krill stock. In this region, krill fishing is permitted in an area of approximately 3.5 million km(2) which is divided into four subareas (labelled Subareas 48.1 to 48.4) for management and reporting purposes. The effective regional catch limit (or 'trigger level'), established in 1991, is 0.62 million tonnes year(-1), equivalent to similar to 1% of the regional biomass estimated in 2000. Each subarea has also had its own catch limit, between 0.093 and 0.279 million tonnes year(-1), since 2009. There is some evidence fora decline in the abundance of krill in the 1980s, but no evidence of a further decline in recent decades. Local-scale monitoring programs have been established in three of the subareas to monitor krill biomass in survey grids covering between 10 000 and 125 000 km(2). Cautious extrapolation from these local monitoring programs provides conservative estimates of the regional biomass in recent years. This suggests that fishing at the trigger level would be equivalent to a long-term exploitation rate (annual catch divided by biomass) of <7%, which is below the 9.3% level considered appropriate to maintain the krill stock and support krill predators. Subarea catch limits exceed 9.3% of conservatively estimated subarea biomass in up to 20% of years due to high variability in krill biomass indices. The actual exploitation rate in each subarea has remained <3% because annual catches have been <50% of the trigger level since 1991. Comparison with the 9.3% reference exploitation rate suggests that current management is precautionary at the regional scale. The subarea catch limits help prevent excessive concentration of catch at the subarea scale. Finer-scale management might be necessary to manage the risk of adverse impacts which might occur as a result of concentrated fishing in sensitive areas or climate change. Frequent assessment of the krill stock will enhance CCAMLR's ability to manage these risks. Continuing the local monitoring programs will provide valuable information on krill variability, but more information is required on how the monitored biomass relates to biomass at the subarea and regional scales.

J	Chu, D; Wiebe, PH				Chu, D; Wiebe, PH			Measurements of sound-speed and density contrasts of zooplankton in Antarctic waters	ICES JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE												Sound-speed and density contrasts (h and g, respectively), two important acoustic material properties, of live zooplankton were measured off the western Antarctic Peninsula during a Southern Ocean GLOBEC cruise conducted from 9 April to 21 May 2002. The work included in situ sound-speed contrast and shipboard density-contrast measurements. The temperature and pressure (depth) dependence of the sound-speed contrast of Euphausia superba and E. crystallorophias as well as that of some other zooplankton species were investigated. The size range of E. superba used in the measurements varied from about 20 mm to 57 mm, with mean length of 36.7 turn and standard deviation of 9.8 turn, which covered life stages from juvenile to adult. For E. superba, there was no statistically significant depth dependence, but there was a moderate dependence of sound-speed and density contrasts on the size of the animals. The measured sound-speed contrast varied between 1.018 and 1.044, with mean value 1.0279 and standard deviation 0.0084, while the measured density contrast varied between 1.007 and 1.036, with mean value 1.0241 and standard deviation 0.0082. For E. crystallorophias and Calanus there was a measurable depth dependence in sound-speed contrast. The in situ sound-speed contrasts for E. crystallorophias were 1.025 +/- 0.004 to 1.029 +/- 0.009. For Calanus, they were variable, with one set giving a value of 0.949 +/- 0.001 and the other giving 1.013 +/- 0.002. Shipboard measurements of other taxa/species also showed substantial variation in g and h. In general, values of g ranged from 0.9402 to 1.051 and h ranged from 0.949 to 1.096. The variation of the material properties is related to species, type, size, stage, and in some cases depth of occurrence. The uncertainty of the estimates of zooplankton biomass attributable to these variations in g and h can be quite large (more than 100 fold). Improvements in making biological inferences from acoustic data depend strongly on increased information about the material properties of zooplankton and the biological causes for their variation, as well as a knowledge of the species composition and abundance.

The fatty acid profile of N. australis was markedly unsaturated, with a mean total omega 3 fatty acid content of 48.6+/-2.4% of total fatty acids. N. australis contained high levels of the essential long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids eicosapentaenoic (EPA, 20:5 omega 3) and docosahexaenoic (DHA, 22:6 omega 3), ranging from 16.6 to 36.5% and 11.1 to 24.8%, respectively. The concentration of total carotenoids ranged from 137 to 302 mu g g(-1) dry wt, with no significant differences in concentrations found with season or life stage. The carotenoids were comprised of 79.5% astaxanthin and 20.5% canthaxanthin. The lipid and pigment compositions of N. australis suggest that the species could serve as a suitable feed source for cultured salmonids. Like other euphausiids, N. australis contained high levels of fluoride, with a seasonal range between 277 and 3507 mu g g(-1) dry wt. The high fluoride levels found in N. australis would not detract from its potential as a feed source for salmonids because ingested fluoride is largely absorbed by the skeleton.

J	SHEEHY, MRJ; ROBERTS, BE				SHEEHY, MRJ; ROBERTS, BE			AN ALTERNATIVE EXPLANATION FOR ANOMALIES IN SOLUBLE LIPOFUSCIN FLUORESCENCE DATA FROM INSECTS, CRUSTACEANS, AND OTHER AQUATIC SPECIES	EXPERIMENTAL GERONTOLOGY												Published attempts to extract lipofuscin from crustaceans and fish to assess age for fisheries research purposes have used essentially the same extraction methodology applied to insects, but have neither shown a conclusive age-dependence of spectrally similar fluorescence nor proved its association with lipofuscin. The reported lipofuscin solvent extraction method for fleshflies, Sarcophaga bullata, was manipulated by varying wash volume. This revealed that almost all age-dependent blue fluorescent material persisting in lipid fractions was actually pteridine-like. This finding was consistent with some previous independent results for Musca domestica. Examination of reported lipofuscin extraction protocols for other insects suggested that this problem was probably widespread. The pteridines are known to occur in unusually high amounts in insects, accumulating with age specifically in some members of this group by storage excretion, probably as a terrestrial water conservation strategy. In addition, there is growing evidence in the gerontological literature for other groups that solvent extracted blue fluorescence is not a true measure of lipofuscin content in tissues. These findings provide considerable insight into anomalies in putative lipofuscin fluorescence data between the insects and various aquatic species and suggest that there may be little basis for expectations of age-dependent fluorescence from aquatic species when the same gross extraction and crude purification methods are used.																	0531-5565	1873-6815					1991	26	5					495	509		10.1016/0531-5565(91)90038-N							WOS:A1991GL10200012	1756781

The females were also injected with tritiated water (HTO) lo estimate food consumption, and non-instrumented females were stomach sampled upon return to the colony to determine their diet. The same data were collected in August/September from 3 males foraging after :heir 4 mo ,prenuptial and incubation fast. Both females and males foraged in pack-ice within 120 km of the colony along a relatively narrow band of the continental shelf in water depths ranging from 200 to 500 m. Only rarely did penguins leave shelf waters to forage in deeper waters over the shelf break. The size of the general foraging area for females was about 11410 km(2), but 50% of all foraging days were spent in only about 15% (1700 km(2)) of the total foraging area. A female of average mass (25 Ig) hunted for about 6 h d(-1), and consumed 1.8 +/- 0.3 kg of food per foraging day. This indicates that females from Auster consumed in winter about 1520 t, about half of which is likely to have been taken from an area measuring only 60 x 28 km. Males were active for about 10 h d(-1) and consumed about twice as much (3.7 +/-: 1.2 kg d(-1) for a 24 kg male) as the females during the early phase of brooding. The diet of females comprised 72% fish (by mass), 16% squid and 12% Antarctic krill Euphausia superba whereas that of the males comprised 53% fish, 2% squid and 43% krill. Most foraging dives of females (81%) and males (64%) were to <200 m and lasted less about 3 min. Males dived deep (>300 m) more frequently than females (19.8% vs 0.1%) but the number of dives per day was similar for both sexes (27 +/- 14 for winter females, 31 +/- 15 for brood-stage males). The small foraging area, diet composition and prey harvest rates of the females provide indirect evidence of the availability of penguin prey species in the pack-ice off Auster in winter.																	0171-8630	1616-1599					1997	159						249	263		10.3354/meps159249							WOS:000071358700023						
J	Zielinski, S; Portner, HO				Zielinski, S; Portner, HO			Oxidative stress and antioxidative defense in cephalopods: a function of metabolic rate or age?	COMPARATIVE BIOCHEMISTRY AND PHYSIOLOGY B-BIOCHEMISTRY & MOLECULAR BIOLOGY												Activities of the antioxidative enzymes superoxide dismutase (SOD). catalase, glutathione peroxidase (GPX) and glutathione reductase (GR) were measured in the cephalopods Sepia officinalis and Lolliguncula brevis,is. Maximal enzyme activities were higher in gill tissue than in the mantle musculature of both species. Activities were generally lower in tissues of L. brevis than in S. officinalis. Comparison with other ectothermic animals showed both cephalopod species to have a low enzymatic antioxidative status despite their high metabolic rate. Furthermore, changes in antioxidative enzyme activities were measured in the cuttlefish S. officinalis with increasing age. The concentrations of malondialdehyde (MDA) and lipofuscin were determined as indicators of lipid peroxidation. Investigated animals were between 1.5 months and over 12 months old. Changes of antioxidative enzyme activities with age were not uniform. SOD and GPX activities increased with age, while catalase activity declined. In contrast, GR activity remained almost unchanged in all age groups. The low level of antioxidative defense might allow for the significant age-induced rise in MDA levels in gills and mantle musculature and for the increase in lipofuscin levels in mantle and brain tissue. It might thereby contribute to increased oxidative damage and a short life span in these cephalopods. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

In this study, we examined the effect on target strength (TS) and lipid content which is a cause of these changes. Density contrasts increased from spring to summer, but sound speed contrasts decreased. There was a negative correlation between density contrasts and wax esters, which are one of the lipid contents, and a positive correlation between sound speed contrasts and total lipid.

J	Cuzin-Roudy, J; Tarling, GA; Stromberg, JO				Cuzin-Roudy, J; Tarling, GA; Stromberg, JO			Life cycle strategies of Northern krill (Meganyctiphanes norvegica) for regulating growth, moult, and reproductive activity in various environments: the case of fjordic populations	ICES JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE					3rd International Zooplankton Production Symposium	MAY 20-23, 2003	Gijon, SPAIN					Adaptive strategies of two fjord populations of Northern krill (Meganyctiphanes norvegica Sars) were studied and compared with other populations from different climatic and oceanic conditions. The Gullmarsfjord (West Sweden) and the Clyde Sea (West Scotland) resident populations followed the same basic pattern of development as the Kattegat (between Denmark and Sweden) and the Ligurian Sea (Northwest Mediterranean) populations, but the fjord krill reached a comparatively larger body size during their second year of life. The positive relationship between body size and fecundity means that fjord populations are potentially more productive than those of the open sea. High rates of moulting and spawning activity were limited to the spring and summer despite the fact that trophic conditions still seemed favourable in early autumn. We show here that, in autumn, the adult moult cycle became longer and growth stopped, large 2-year-old krill disappeared from the population and ovarian development was arrested. Resources already accumulated ill the oocytes (glycoproteic and lipid yolk) were recovered by oosorption and ovaries regressed for a winter rest. Autumn trophic conditions were still favourable in both sites, especially in terms of copepod abundance. However, the phytoplankton community changed from a dominance of diatoms in early season to dinoflagellates in late summer. We suggest that these changes triggered the autumn arrest of krill production. (C) 2004 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

In the Northern krill, Meganyctiphanes norvegica (M. Sars), female krill produce eggs cyclically. Spawning moult cycles alternate with vitellogenic moult cycles for lipid yolk accumulation. Histology shows that lipids are associated with the R cells of the digestive gland in both sexes, with the yolk platelets of mature oocytes and with the fat body cell membranes and blood lacunae in reproducing females. Mature female krill can have a total lipid content twice as high as males, mostly due to accumulation in the ovary, the fat body and the haemolymph. In contrast, in males, as well as in non-reproducing females, the highest percentage of lipids is found in the digestive gland and the haemolymph. In Meganyctiphanes norvegica, the most abundant lipid fractions are polar lipids and triglycerides, the latter being relatively low in reproducing female gonad and fat body. Triglycerides are believed to be a pure energy source and polar lipids are essential for membrane development in embryos. The fatty acid content and composition of the triglyceride and polar lipid fractions in females are different from males, related to both reproductive and dietary processes. Higher levels of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) in the polar lipid fraction were found in reproductive females. During the non-reproductive season, the converse was found, indicating the specific role PUFA and other fatty acids play in growth and egg production. Adaptive processes linked to reproduction were studied comparatively in three populations of the Northern krill - Clyde Sea (W, Scotland), Kattegat (E, Denmark), Ligurian Sea (Mediterranean) - all differing considerably in climatic and trophic conditions. Such adjustments in lipid synthesis and storage are viewed as reproductive strategies developed by the Northern krill in response to different environmental conditions.

Composition of wax esters is linked to diapause behavior of Calanus finmarchicus in a sea loch environment	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												We studied the seasonal lipid dynamics of Calanus finmarchicus from Loch Etive, a semi-enclosed fjordic environment on the west coast of Scotland, in relation to the diapause behavior of this species. Levels of total lipid and triacylglycerol in individual copepodid stage V (CVs) exhibited clear seasonal trends, with highest levels in June and progressively decreasing through late summer to winter. Wax esters in CVs were more variable, but followed a similar pattern. An index of the level of unsaturation of wax esters, effectively an indicator of the levels of polyunsaturated fatty acids in the wax ester reserves, were highest in midsummer and declined progressively through autumn and winter. Fatty acid analysis of total lipid in the CVs confirmed that the amounts of polyunsaturated fatty acids in the wax esters decreased, while amounts of saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids remained comparatively stable. Polyunsaturated wax esters are selectively catabolized by C. finmarchicus during diapause. Previous studies have linked unsaturation of wax esters in calanoid copepods to the initiation of diapause and buoyancy control, and we hypothesize that selective catabolism of polyunsaturated wax esters is linked to the processes of diapause termination and ascent to surface waters.																	0024-3590	1939-5590				JAN	2012	57	1					65	75		10.4319/lo.2012.57.1.0065							WOS:000298321300006						
J	Kirkwood, R; Robertson, G				Kirkwood, R; Robertson, G			Seasonal change in the foraging ecology of emperor penguins on the Mawson Coast, Antarctica	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												We investigated the foraging location, diving behaviour, dietary composition, feeding rates and foraging trip durations of emperor penguins Aptenodytes forsteri raising chicks at the Auster and Taylor Glacier colonies on the Mawson Coast of Antarctica in the winter, spring and early summer of 1993, to examine seasonal changes in the penguins' foraging ecology. As day-length increased after winter, the penguins' daily swimming time increased from 7.83 +/- 1.50 h in August to 12.23 +/- 1.25 h in September and 12.95 +/- 1.24 h in October. Accordingly, the penguins' dive rate increased from 92.7 +/- 28.5 to 149.4 +/- 23.4 and 161.6 +/- 19.3 dives d(-1) in the respective months. The birds targeted prey in the vicinity of the continental slope mainly at depths <100 m, although some individuals frequently hunted at depths >200 m, and the maximum depth achieved was 438 m. Antarctic krill Euphausia superba were the most common prey taken overall, 41% of the diet by mass, and dominated the diets between August and October. The contribution of Antarctic krill to the diet reduced over time from 68% in August to 1% in early December. In November, the glacier squid Psychroteuthis glacialis dominated the diet (47 to 63%), and in early December the diet comprised various species of fish, Trematomus species (27%), Pagothenia borchgrevinki (24%), and Pleuragramma antarcticum (8%), and squid, P. glacialis (13%) and Alluroteuthis antarcticus (9%). The birds' prey consumption rates more than doubled between late winter and early summer, from 4.0 +/- 1.0 to 8.7 +/- 1.7 kg d(-1) spent foraging; these values are equivalent to metabolisable energy intakes of 628 +/- 134 and 1422 +/- 308 kJ kg(-1) d(-1), respectively. During brooding (late winter to early spring), females spent less time at sea than males (8.7 +/- 2.7 vs 17.7 +/- 3.8 d); thereafter trip durations of both sexes were similar and declined from 15-19 d in spring to <10 d in early summer. Between hatching and about 1 wk prior to fledging each parent fed its chick 7 or 8 times. To raise a chick, females and males consumed approximately 410 and 470 kg of prey respectively, or 880 kg for each breeding pair. Seasonal variations in the penguins' foraging were probably influenced by fluctuating sea-ice conditions, differences in the prey types available, changes in day-length toward summer, and increasing demands of the growing chicks.																	0171-8630						1997	156						205	223		10.3354/meps156205							WOS:A1997XZ98100020

Sixty-nine taxa including different developmental stages were considered and divided into 16 size classes between < 1 and > 39.5 mm length. Biomass was determined by taxon and size class for three different meso- and macroplankton communities in the oceanic region, on the northeastern shelf and on the southern shelf of the Weddell Sea. The highest biomass of 11.2 mg DW m-3 (3.4 g DW m-2) was found in the northeastern shelf community (70 to 74-degrees-S), where juvenile and adult Euphausia crystallorophias accounted for 3.7 mg DW m-3 (1.1 g DW m-2). Although not quantitatively sampled, early copepodite stages (CI to CIII) of Calanoides acutus and Calanus propinquus ranked second with 2.7 mg DW m-3 (0.8 g DW m-2). Biomass in the northeastern shelf community was concentrated in the size ranges 1 to 4 mm and 19.5 to 39.5 mm. The oceanic community of the central Weddell Sea was dominated by copepods smaller than 5 mm, which made up half of the total oceanic biomass. The tunicate Salpa thompsoni (7.0 to 8.5 mm) was the dominant single species with 1.6 mg DW m-3 (0.5 g DW m-2). Euphausiids, mainly juvenile and adult krill Euphausia superba, comprised 1.2 mg DW m-3 (0.4 g DW m-2). Total standing stock in the oceanic community was 9.4 mg DW m-3 (2.8 g DW m-2). Lowest biomass values were found in the southern shelf community (south of 75 S) with 4.0 mg DW m-3 (1.2 g DW m-2), concentrated in the 1 to 4 mm and 14.5 to 34.5 mm size classes. Abundant species were the pteropod Limacina helicina (1 to 2 mm; 0.7 mg DW m-3; 0.2 g DW m-2) and E. crystallorophias (24.5 to 39.5 mm; 0.9 mg DW m-3; 0.3 g DW m-2). The data reveal that it is essential to distinguish among subsystems in the Southern Ocean. This leads to a better understanding of the structure and function of those pelagic food webs which represent alternatives to the paradigmatic krill-centered system.

J	Tarling, GA				Tarling, GA			Sex-dependent diel vertical migration in northern krill Meganyctiphanes norvegica and its consequences for population dynamics	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												The diel vertical migration (DVM) and population dynamics of northern krill were investigated in the Clyde Sea over several years using depth-discrete net-sampling and a moored 300 kHz acoustic Doppler current profiler. Krill performed DVM throughout each year of sampling. The respective arrival and departure of the krill scattering layer to and from the upper layers occurred consistently 30 min after sunset and 30 min before sunrise. DVM of males and females was different, with females migrating closer to the surface at night than males of equivalent size. The sex ratio was initially 1:1 when juveniles matured into adults after their first winter, but the ratio became increasingly biased towards males as the season progressed such that, by October, the ratio was close to 3:1. A deterministic individual-based model, in which predation risk was a function of the light available to visual predators, showed that the bias could be accounted for by the difference in risk taken by males and females as a result of their DVMs. The same model also showed that, during summer, the difference in these DVMs resulted in females making a net energy gain that was 40% higher than that of males. The predicted net energy gain for females met the immediate energetic demand for egg production as well as providing a surplus that could offset any future decline in food availability. The model did not predict the observation that the decline in male numbers was greater than that of females over the winter. This may be a result of females being more able to cope with starvation through reabsorption of their lipid-rich ovaries. The greater demand for energy to fuel reproduction appeared to be driving females to undertake a riskier DVM than males. This drive is likely to be common to most euphausiid species.																	0171-8630	1616-1599					2003	260						173	188		10.3354/meps260173							WOS:000186420500015						
J	Hu, MYA; Hagen, W; Jeng, MS; Saborowski, R				Hu, Marian Yong-An; Hagen, Wilhelm; Jeng, Ming-Shiou; Saborowski, Reinhard			Metabolic energy demand and food utilization of the hydrothermal vent crab Xenograpsus testudinatus (Crustacea: Brachyura)	AQUATIC BIOLOGY												The hydrothermal vent crab Xenograpsus testudinatus (Crustacea: Brachyura) is endemic near Kueishan Island, Taiwan, where it lives in shallow waters close to the hydrothermal vents located in this area. X. testudinatus is adapted to a sulfur-rich and thus potentially toxic environment. It has established a specialized feeding strategy focusing on dead zooplankton organisms killed by the toxic discharges from the vents. During slack water, when there is little or no current, the crabs leave their crevices to feed on this 'marine snow'. In the present study, we investigated the physiological aspects of nutritional adaptations of X. testudinatus. The crabs showed high digestive capacities of major digestive enzymes and particularly high activities for proteolytic enzymes. This feature can be regarded as an adaptation to irregular food availability. Furthermore, enzymes were stable at elevated temperatures, in a wide pH range, and in the presence of inorganic inhibitors like Cu2+, Fe2+, or Co2+. These enzyme properties can be considered essential to functioning in a vent habitat over long exposure times. Moreover, X. testudinatus is able to store significant amounts of lipid (50 to 60% of dry mass in the midgut gland), which may help to overcome periods of food scarcity. Fatty acid profiles revealed high amounts of saturated and monounsaturated components (mainly 16:0, 16:1(n-7), 18:1(n-9), and 18:1(n-7)). These findings reflect physiological adaptations and energetic strategies that enable this crab to exist in this extreme hydrothermal vent habitat.

Food web dynamics in the Scotia Sea in summer: A stable isotope study	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY												The pelagic food web of the Scotia Sea was studied by analysing natural abundances of nitrogen and carbon stable isotopes of primary producers and pelagic consumers, sampled from the seasonal ice edge in the south to the Antarctic Polar Front in the north. The analysis covered, within a single mid-summer period, particulate organic matter (POM) and 38 taxa, ranging from suspension feeding copepods and salps to omnivorous euphausiids, pelagic fish and higher, land-based predators including fur seals, penguins and flying birds. Spatial variation in delta N-15 of POM correlated well with nutrient availability and primary productivity. Latitudinal differences in delta C-13 of POM were closely linked to variations in temperature, nutrients and productivity depending on the frontal region sampled. This translated to equivalent (although smaller) regional delta C-13 differences among higher trophic levels. The trophic positions of species based on isotope values broadly agreed with previously published dietary data with three important exceptions. First, the carnivorous amphipod Themisto gaudichaudii had anomalously low delta N-15 values. Second, Euphausia superba had delta N-15 values that were also surprisingly low, considering the abundant literature suggesting its omnivory. Third, the copepod Rhincalanus gigas, considered a suspension feeder, had unexpectedly high delta N-15 values rather more in keeping with omnivorous feeding. The consumer delta N-15 values ranged from 1.2 parts per thousand (min.) measured in Salpa thompsoni (designated here as trophic level (TL) 2 across all regions) to 15.2 parts per thousand (max.) measured in white-chinned petrels (Procellaria aequinoctialis, calculated as TL5 relative to the TL2 of salps). Excluding seabirds, the resulting food chain length of 3.7 TL (above POM at TL1) was lower than in most other Southern Ocean and temperate marine pelagic ecosystems. The majority (60%) of vertebrate predators occupied only 1-1.5 trophic levels above the herbivorous suspension feeders such as krill. This indicates the existence of the classic short food chain of POM-suspension feeder-vertebrate predator. However the presence of trophic levels 4 and above indicates the existence of alternative trophic pathways, for example involving myctophid fish or carrion, and that some wide-ranging predators which breed at South Georgia also feed outside the region. This conclusion is supported first by the continuum of delta N-15 values between krill, suspension feeding copepods and myctophid fish, and secondly by higher trophic levels in several of the myctophid species in the low-krill region of the northern Scotia Sea, suggesting latitudinal differences in food web structure and food chain length.

In this context, we tested the "Intersexual Competition Hypothesis" for penguins by investigating the feeding ecology of Gentoo penguins during their austral winter non-breeding season. We considered this during unusual environmental conditions (i.e. the year 2009 had observations of high sea surface and air temperatures) in comparison with the long term average at Bird Island, South Georgia. Through conventional (i.e. stomach contents) and stable isotopic values from red blood cells, plasma and feathers of both male and female Gentoo penguins, we showed that there were significant differences between sexes, with males feeding mainly on fish (54% by mass) followed by crustaceans (38%) whereas females fed mainly on crustaceans (89% by mass) followed by fish (4%). Themisto gaudichaudii was the most important crustacean prey for males (64% by mass; 82% by number; 53% by frequency of occurrence) and females (63% by mass; 77% by number; 89% by frequency of occurrence), contrasting with all previous studies that found Antarctic krill Euphausia superba were generally the main prey. Stable isotopic data showed that, in terms of habitat use (based on delta C-13), there were significant differences in short-term carbon signatures between males and females (based on plasma and red blood cells), suggesting that both sexes explored different habitats, with females exploring more offshore pelagic waters and males feeding more in coastal benthic waters. Based on delta N-15, males fed on significantly higher trophic level than females (based on plasma and red blood cells), in agreement with our diet results., Thus, Gentoo penguins behave in a similar manner to other non-breeding penguins species (e.g. king, macaroni and rockhopper penguins), albeit at a smaller spatial scale (as they do not disperse as these other penguins do), in that they have a wider habitat and trophic niche during the Antarctic Winter (in comparison to Summer). We also detected individual specialization in feeding/trophic levels for each gender, with certain males feeding mainly on fish and certain females mainly on crustaceans, which may be driven the prevailing environmental conditions that lead individuals to search for alternative prey, and cause sexual diet segregation. Our results provide further information to help improve understanding about sexual segregation and individual specialization of marine organisms, while contributing valuable information on the winter diet for Antarctic monitoring programs and for modelling Antarctic marine food webs.

J	Schaub, J; McLaskey, AK; Forster, I; Hunt, BPV				Schaub, Jessica; McLaskey, Anna K.; Forster, Ian; Hunt, Brian P., V			Experimentally derived estimates of turnover and modification for stable isotopes and fatty acids in scyphozoan jellyfish	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY												Stable isotopes (SIs) and fatty acids (FAs) are biomarkers that are commonly used in ecology to investigate trophic relationships, energy pathways over time, and food quality. To use these trophic markers to model complex in situ data, accurate parameters should ideally be estimated from feeding studies performed in controlled laboratory settings. Two key parameters are turnover times and modification between trophic levels. However, food web studies for jellyfish that employ biomarkers typically apply generic parameter values because jellyfish-specific estimates are scarce. To address this, we implemented a controlled laboratory feeding study to measure turnover time and modification of FAs and SIs of carbon (delta C-13) and nitrogen (delta N-15) in Aurelia aurita and Chrysaora pacifica. Two diet switch experiments were conducted and resulted in three feeding scenarios: (i) Aurelia aurita and Chrysaora pacifica feeding on the same crustacean prey, Artemia, (ii) Aurelia aurita feeding on two different crustacean prey treatments, Artemia and Euphausia superba, and (iii) Chrysaora pacifica feeding on Aurelia aurita. Turnover time was variable among markers, ranging from 17 to 34 days in Aurelia aurita for FAs. We were unable to estimate SI turnover time for Aurelia aurita. In Chrysaora pacifica, half-life for delta C-13 (15 days) was similar to some FAs (8 to 15 days) but was half as long as delta N-15 (36 days). We estimated trophic enrichment factors for specific predator and prey combinations, including jellyfish feeding on crustacean zooplankton (Delta delta C-13 = 1.19 +/- 0.37% and Delta delta N-15 = 2.09 +/- 0.52%) and jellyfish feeding on interspecific jellyfish (Delta delta C-13 = 1.59 +/- 0.69% and Delta delta N-15 = 1.35 +/- 1.70%). Modification of FAs was widespread and should be considered when applying FAs to investigate jellyfish ecology. A pattern emerged in predators compared to their prey, where proportions of 18-carbon FAs decreased and proportions of 20-carbon FAs almost always increased. This suggests the possibility of a 2-carbon elongation pathway in jellyfish, similar to what has been found in other marine zooplankton. Total mu g of FA per mg of sample dry weight in predators decreased over time when switched to prey with lower total FA than the initial prey. The parameter estimates provided here expand current applications of SIs and FAs for jellyfish trophic ecology, improve parameterization of jellyfish food web models, and ultimately expand our understanding of the complex role that jellyfish have in food webs.																	0022-0981	1879-1697				DEC	2021	545								151631	10.1016/j.jembe.2021.151631							WOS:000703467700006

Mechanisms of dissolved and labile particulate iron supply to shelf waters and phytoplankton blooms off South Georgia, Southern Ocean	BIOGEOSCIENCES												The island of South Georgia is situated in the iron (Fe)-depleted Antarctic Circumpolar Current of the Southern Ocean. Iron emanating from its shelf system fuels large phytoplankton blooms downstream of the island, but the actual supply mechanisms are unclear. To address this, we present an inventory of Fe, manganese (Mn), and aluminium (Al) in shelf sediments, pore waters, and the water column in the vicinity of South Georgia, alongside data on zooplankton-mediated Fe cycling processes, and provide estimates of the relative dissolved Fe (DFe) fluxes from these sources. Seafloor sediments, modified by authigenic Fe precipitation, were the main particulate Fe source to shelf bottom waters as indicated by the similar Fe / Mn and Fe / Al ratios for shelf sediments and suspended particles in the water column. Less than 1% of the total particulate Fe pool was leachable surface-adsorbed (labile) Fe and therefore potentially available to organisms. Pore waters formed the primary DFe source to shelf bottom waters, supplying 0.1-44 mu mol DFe m(-2) d(-1). However, we estimate that only 0.41 +/- 0.26 mu mol DFe m(-2) d(-1) was transferred to the surface mixed layer by vertical diffusive and advective mixing. Other trace metal sources to surface waters included glacial flour released by melting glaciers and via zooplankton egestion and excretion processes. On average 6.5 +/- 8.2 mu mol m(-2) d(-1) of labile particulate Fe was supplied to the surface mixed layer via faecal pellets formed by Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba), with a further 1.1 +/- 2.2 mu mol DFe m(-2) d(-1) released directly by the krill. The faecal pellets released by krill included seafloor-derived lithogenic and authigenic material and settled algal debris, in addition to freshly ingested suspended phytoplankton cells. The Fe requirement of the phytoplankton blooms similar to 1250 km downstream of South Georgia was estimated as 0.33 +/- 0.11 mu mol m(-2) d(-1), with the DFe supply by horizontal/vertical mixing, deep winter mixing, and aeolian dust estimated as similar to 0.12 mu mol m(-2) d(-1). We hypothesize that a substantial contribution of DFe was provided through recycling of biogenically stored Fe following luxury Fe uptake by phytoplankton on the Fe-rich shelf.

J	Freese, D; Soreide, JE; Graeve, M; Niehoff, B				Freese, Daniela; Soreide, Janne E.; Graeve, Martin; Niehoff, Barbara			A year-round study on metabolic enzymes and body composition of the Arctic copepod Calanus glacialis: implications for the timing and intensity of diapause	MARINE BIOLOGY												Knowledge on the capability of zooplankton to adapt to the rapidly changing environmental conditions in the Arctic is crucial to predict future ecosystem processes. The key species on the Arctic shelf, the calanoid copepod Calanus glacialis, grows and accumulates lipid reserves in spring and summer in surface waters. The winter is spent in dormancy in deeper water layers with low metabolic activity. As timing and intensity of metabolic changes have been poorly investigated, our study aims to characterize the physiology of C. glacialis over an entire year, from July 2012 to July 2013. We followed anabolic and catabolic enzyme activities and the biochemical composition of this species, taking depth-stratified samples once a month in Billefjorden, a high-Arctic sill fjord. A large part of the population had migrated to depths > 100 m by July 2012. Only thereafter, anabolic activities decreased slowly, suggesting that low metabolism is related to ceased feeding rather than to endogenous regulation. During overwintering, anabolic enzyme activities were reduced by half as compared to peak activities in spring. The biochemical composition of the copepods changed little from July to December. Then, the lipid catabolic activity increased and the lipid content decreased, likely fuelling moulting and gonad maturation. The protein content did not change significantly during winter, suggesting that proteins are not much catabolized during that time. The relatively high metabolic activity in C. glacialis in winter suggests that this species is not entering a true diapause and should thus be able to respond flexible to changing environmental conditions.				; Graeve, Martin/B-5751-2017	Niehoff, Barbara/0000-0002-7483-9373; Graeve, Martin/0000-0002-2294-1915												0025-3162	1432-1793				JAN	2017	164	1							3	10.1007/s00227-016-3036-2							WOS:000392332900003

The importance of pelagic longline fishery discards for a seabird community determined through stable isotope analysis	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY												Seabird species within a community are expected to have distinct trophic niches according to foraging methods and body size, but some seabirds exploit fishery waste which can be quite distinct from natural foods. Even in the presence of fishery discards we hypothesize that a pelagic seabird community is structured according to body size, feeding methods, and access to discards. We measured carbon and nitrogen stable isotopes in whole blood of seabirds from the offshore wintering community of Procellariiformes (albatrosses, petrels, shearwaters and storm-petrels) in the SW Atlantic Ocean. We compared this with isotope values of potential prey items and fishery discards, to investigate the importance of discards from the tuna-shark pelagic longline fishery in the diet of these birds. Despite contrasting body masses and feeding techniques, there was extensive overlap in the range of isotopic ratios for different species. Carbon isotope values were typical of the subtropical offshore region. Nitrogen values also showed a high degree of overlap among species and clearly signify that the birds are feeding on fishery waste (especially shark liver). Recently arrived migrants from the Antarctic and sub-Antarctic, and species still rearing chicks when sampled (e.g. wandering albatross Diomedea exulans) had carbon isotopic values indicative of Antarctic and sub-Antarctic regions. All species breeding at more southerly latitudes underwent a marked shift (increase) in carbon and nitrogen isotopes, indicating a change in diet between breeding and wintering seasons. Cory's shearwater (Calonectris diomedea), the only sampled species not attending vessels, had low nitrogen values reflecting a diet of flying fish which occur naturally in the area and showed no change in isotope values between breeding and wintering grounds. Mixing models demonstrate the need to include an external food source (Antarctic krill) to recreate the isotope values obtained from seabird blood: this corresponds to the blood of wintering migrants retaining a minor component from their diet in the southern breeding grounds. The stable isotope results suggest that the availability of discards from pelagic fisheries in the SW Atlantic Ocean lead to an artificially and poorly structured seabird community, with most species utilizing the same food resource. The balance between population benefits obtained from feeding upon otherwise unavailable discards, and the costs from incidental mortality on longline fishing hooks is likely to differ among species, with positive effects for small-sized species and negative effects on albatrosses and Procellaria petrels.

J	Zhang, TT; Xu, J; Wang, YM; Xue, CH				Zhang, Tian-Tian; Xu, Jie; Wang, Yu-Ming; Xue, Chang-Hu			Health benefits of dietary marine DHA/EPA-enriched glycerophospholipids	PROGRESS IN LIPID RESEARCH												A typical feature of marine foods is that they are rich in docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), which have formed a large-scale global industry. DHA/EPA phospholipids (PLs) are ubiquitous in marine foods and are the main DHA/EPA molecular forms in fish roe, shrimp and shellfish. Much attention has been focused on the bioavailability and health benefits that are influenced by the type and esterified form of dietary fatty acids. Recently, numerous findings have suggested that dietary DHA/EPA-PLs are superior to the triacylglycerol (TAG) or ethyl ester forms in exerting their functional properties through specific mechanisms of action. However, there is no comprehensive review covering the health benefits of dietary marine DHA/EPA-enriched PLs. In this paper, we review publications on the nutritional functions of DHA/EPA-enriched glycerophospholipids, including the effects on brain function, antitumor activity, lipid metabolism, and glucose metabolism. The current research status regarding the active ingredients, sources, models, treatment, duration, and mechanisms are presented. In addition, the way in which the structure-activity relationship of DHA/EPA-PLs is affected by ester-bond structure at the sn-1 position, fatty acid at the sn-2 position and polar head group at the sn-3 position is also reviewed. DHA/EPA-PLs are one of the major n-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acid dietary forms in our diet, and we should maximize the ability to fully exploit the nutritional properties of DHA/EPA.																	0163-7827	1873-2194				JUL	2019	75								100997	10.1016/j.plipres.2019.100997							WOS:000487169700004	31442526

Fine-scale habitat selection of crabeater seals as determined by diving behavior	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY												Previous studies within the Marguerite Bay region of the Antarctic Peninsula (similar to 67 degrees S, similar to 67 degrees W) demonstrated that during winter, crabeater seals (Lobodon carcinophagus) were not randomly distributed across available habitat, but instead were more likely to be located in nearshore waters where bathymetric gradients and ice concentrations were high. Here, we investigate how the diving patterns of crabeater seals vary in response to these habitat characteristies, and interpret seal behaviors in light of information on the distribution of their primary prey, krill (Euphausia superba or Euphausia crystallorophias). Diving and movement patterns were obtained from 34 seals (16 male, 18 female) fitted with satellite-relayed data loggers (SRDLs) during the 2001 and 2002 Southern Ocean GLOBEC cruises. Tags transmitted position and dive information for 4-174 days, during which time we received an average of 21 positions/day, and information on a total of 124,681 dives. A series of generalized linear mixed-effect models (GLMM) were used to evaluate the relationship between diving behavior and temporal and physical features of the habitat, and models contrasted using AIC(c) and BIC weights. Overall, we found that the most parsimonious models included year, month, and period (day, dusk, night). In general, seals dived deeper (158 vs. 73 m) and longer (432 vs. 360 s) during the day than at night. In addition, daytime dives included slightly more time at the foraging depths (142 vs. 102 s), and were slightly more efficient (24% vs. 21% of the dive cycle spent at the bottom). When dive patterns were examined with respect to bathymetry, models indicated that seals were foraging in shallower waters (366 vs. 410m) and closer to the bottom (dives were 50.3% vs. 26.3% of bathymetric depth) during the day than at night. In combination, these findings suggest that crabeater seals foraging during the day exploited zooplankton schools compressed along the bottom. At night, when zooplankton were dispersed and light levels low, foraging activity was less frequent and seals concentrated their diving closer to the surface over a broader range of habitat depths. As individual seals moved an average of only 4.1 +/- 1.4 km between daytime and nighttime positions, these results suggest that crabeater seals diving along the Western Antarctic Peninsula select areas of high bathymetric gradients so that they can maximize foraging success over a 24-h cycle without the need to travel long distances. However, annual differences in behavior and the generally low amount of deviation explained by models also suggests that seals vary their diving behavior in response to finer-scale biological, temporal, and/or physical features that were not monitored as part of this study.

Cellular Changes Associated with the Acclimation of the Intertidal Sea Anemone Actinia tenebrosa to Ultraviolet Radiation	PHOTOCHEMISTRY AND PHOTOBIOLOGY												To assess the relative importance of long- and short-term cellular defense mechanisms in seasonally UV-R-acclimated Actinia tenebrosa (Anthozoa, Actiniidae), individuals were exposed to summer doses of PAR, UV-A, UV-B and enhanced UV-B (20%) for a period of 4days. Mycosporine-like amino acids (MAAs) and cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer (CPD) concentrations were quantified, while oxidative damage to lipids and proteins, and the activities or levels of the antioxidant enzymes SOD, CAT, GR, GPOX and total glutathione were determined. Our results show that summer UV-R-acclimated individuals had a higher UV-R tolerance, with no significant increases in CPDs levels, than winter-acclimated sea anemones possibly due to higher MAA concentrations. Summer-acclimated individuals showed increased lipid and protein oxidation and GPOX activity only when they were exposed to UV-B at 20% above ambient UV-R levels. In contrast, winter-acclimated sea anemones showed elevated levels of oxidative damage, GPOX and SOD activities after exposure to UV-A or UV-B at ambient and elevated levels. Thus, this study indicates that long-term UV-R acclimation mechanisms such as the accumulation of MAAs could be more important than short-term increases in antioxidant defenses with respect to reducing indirect UV-R damage in intertidal sea anemones.

Both species showed distinct differences in the amount of total lipids (TLs), lipid class and fatty acid (FA) compositions as well as proteolytic enzyme activities. In M. norvegica, the overall amount of TLs and storage lipids was much lower than in H. glacialis, and triacylglycerols formed the major lipid fraction with a mean of 48% TLs. Major FAs comprised the trophic markers 20:1(n-9) and 22:1(n-11), indicating the ingestion of calanid copepods. Additionally, the FAs 22:6(n-3), 18:1(n-9) and 16:0 prevailed. In H. glacialis, TLs (mean = 44% dry mass) were about twice as high as in krill, with wax esters comprising up to 89% TLs. H. glacialis seems to accumulate these lipids as energy reserves to survive periods of food limitation. Moreover, high lipid levels, particularly wax esters, also help to maintain neutral buoyancy. The major FA in H. glacialis was 18:1(n-9); other dominant FAs were 20:1(n-9) and 22:1(n-11), typical of calanid copepods, as well as the diatom trophic marker 16:1(n-7). Both species showed omnivorous feeding behaviour with a strong tendency towards carnivory. Total proteolytic activities in midgut gland tissue were higher in M. norvegica than in H. glacialis. In M. norvegica, proteinases were dominated by serine proteinases, whereas cysteine proteinases formed the major group in H. glacialis. High proteolytic activity in M. norvegica indicates a high digestive potential for proteins and efficient utilization of prey. The presence of different proteinase classes in both species may be due to different group-specific enzyme expression patterns between euphausiids and caridean decapods. Both species follow highly deviating life strategies, as reflected by their specific lipid and enzymatic characteristics.

In the present study, we evaluated the food and feed safety of six of the most abundant mesopelagic species in Norwegian fjords. Trace elements (i.e., arsenic, cadmium, mercury, and lead), organic pollutants (i.e., dioxins, furans, dioxin-like polychlorinated biphenyls, and polybrominated flame-retardants), and potentially problematic lipid compounds (i.e., wax esters and erucic acid) were analyzed and compared to existing food and feed maximum levels and intake recommendations. Furthermore, contaminant loads in processed mesopelagic biomass (protein, oil, and fish meal) was estimated using worst-case scenarios to identify possible food and feed safety issues. While most undesirables were low considering European food legislation, we identified a few potential food safety issues regarding high levels of fluoride in Northern krill, wax esters in glacier lanternfish, and long-chain monounsaturated fatty acids in silvery lightfish. Our estimates in processed biomass indicated high levels of undesirable trace elements in the protein fraction, frequently exceeding the maximum levels for feed ingredients. However, in fish meal, almost no exceedances were seen. In the oil fraction, dioxins and furans were above the maximum levels, given for food and feed ingredients. The present study is crucial to enable an evaluation of the value of these species; however, more data is needed before proceeding with large-scale harvesting of mesopelagic biomass.

Three extruded diets were fed for 100 days to salmon with an average weight of 550 g. distributed into 9 tanks equipped with flow through sea water. The dietary treatments comprised a control diet based on high-quality fish meal (FM) and two experimental diets where the FM was substituted with either partially deshelled krill meal (PDKM) or whole krill meal (WKM). Shell removal reduced the chitin content from 28 to 8 g kg(-1) dry matter (DM), while fluoride was only reduced from 940 to 631 mg kg(-1) DM. Growth rate for fish fed WKM was significantly lower than for salmon fed control diet whereas the PDKM diet did not appear to alter growth during the first feeding period. Digestibility of lipid tended to be higher for PDKM and lower for WKM compared to the FM control. No significant difference was seen for digestibility of nitrogen, but fish fed the FM diet had higher digestibility of threonine, serine, glutamine, histidine and lysine compared to fish fed the WKM diet. No major differences in plasma were seen for triacylglycerols, free fatty acids, glucose, total protein, albumin, globulin, urea, and total bilirubin. Trypsin activities in the pyloric and mid intestine were lower in fish fed the WKM diet compared to FM. Bile acid concentration in the pyloric intestine were significantly lower in fish fed the WKM diet compared to FM and PDKM. Fish fed both diets containing krill meal had signs of mild to moderate nephrosis. To conclude, PDKM could successfully replace FM as a sole protein source for Atlantic salmon, whereas the WKM slightly reduced growth rate compared to the FM and the PDKM diet. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

We studied the effects of concentrates of phospholipids, sphingolipids, and/or 3-n fatty acids on the expression of genes or miRNAs related to synaptic activity and/or neurodegeneration, in the hippocampus of aged Wistar rats following a 3-month supplementation. The combination of two phospholipidic concentrates of krill oil (KOC) and buttermilk (BMFC) origin modulated the hippocampal expression of 119 miRNAs (11 were common to both BMFC and BMFC + KOC groups). miR-191a-5p and miR-29a-3p changed significantly only in the BMFC group, whereas miR-195-3p and miR-148a-5p did so only in the combined-supplemented group. Thirty-eight, 58, and 72 differentially expressed genes (DEG) were found in the groups supplemented with KOC, BMFC and BMFC + KOC, respectively. Interaction analysis unveiled networks of selected miRNAs with their potential target genes. DEG found in the KOC and BMFC groups were mainly involved in neuroactive processes, whereas they were associated with lysosomes and mRNA surveillance pathways in the BMFC + KOC group. We also report a significant reduction in hippocampal ceramide levels with BMFC + KOC.

Perspectives on marine zooplankton lipids	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												We developed new perspectives to identify important questions and to propose approaches for future research on marine food web lipids. They were related to (i) structure and function of lipids, (ii) lipid changes during critical life phases, (iii) trophic marker lipids, and (iv) potential impact of climate change. The first addresses the role of lipids in membranes, storage lipids, and buoyancy with the following key question: How are the properties of membranes and deposits affected by the various types of lipids? The second deals with the importance of various types of lipids during reproduction, development, and resting phases and addresses the role of the different storage lipids during growth and dormancy. The third relates to trophic marker lipids, which are an important tool to follow lipid and energy transfer through the food web. The central question is how can fatty acids be used to identify and quantify food web relationships? With the fourth, hypotheses are presented on effects of global warming, which may result in the reduction or change in abundance of large, lipid-rich copepods in polar oceans, thereby strongly affecting higher trophic levels. The key question is how will lipid dynamics respond to changes in ocean climate at high latitudes?.

To determine the changes of molecular mechanisms, which would lead to physiological changes in P. nana, we investigated mRNA expression involved in lipogenesis, the area of lipid droplets, the ratio of fatty acids, and life parameters (growth and fecundity) in response to temperature changes (15, 20, and 30 A degrees C) with comparative control at 25 A degrees C. Setting the temperature 25 A degrees C as a standard point, there were increases in mRNA expression, the area of the lipid droplets, and fatty acid composition at temperatures below the standard (15 A degrees C), while all the markers mentioned above significantly decreased at higher temperatures than the standard (25 A degrees C). Through fecundity and growth rate experiments, daily nauplii production was reduced and growth retardation was observed at both 15 and 20 A degrees C, but no noticeable differences in the two parameters were observed at 30 A degrees C compared to the control (25 A degrees C). This study provides a better understanding of the effects of temperature on lipogenesis in copepods.

J	Huenerlage, K; Buchholz, F				Huenerlage, Kim; Buchholz, Friedrich			Krill of the northern Benguela Current and the Angola-Benguela frontal zone compared: physiological performance and short-term starvation in Euphausia hanseni	JOURNAL OF PLANKTON RESEARCH												Adult Euphausia hanseni, keystone and most abundant krill species in the northern Benguela Upwelling area, were sampled during late austral summer in two water masses (northern Benguela Current versus Angola-Benguela-Front waters) along the Atlantic coast off Namibia. This study investigates the species physiological performance at different temperatures which it naturally experiences during diel vertical migration as well as its capacity to physiologically adapt to seven consecutive days of starvation. Moulting rates, metabolic rates, carbon demand, total lipid and protein contents, citrate synthase activity and kinetics, C:N ratios and stable isotope ratios were measured. These parameters were used to estimate the species physiological condition and adaptive capability within the nutritionally poly-pulsed Benguela upwelling system to cope with short periods of food absence. Moulting rates correlated negatively with temperature. Metabolic rates followed the Q(10) rule and declined significantly over the starvation period. Decreasing trends in the other parameters similarly suggest an adaptation to remain metabolically efficient. Ammonium excretion rates, oxygen to nitrogen ratios and stable isotopes showed strong distinctions between regions. Considerable differences were found between regions in the nutritional condition of E. hanseni. The total lipid content and the physiological reaction to starvation are different from euphausiids from other latitudes and help to define E. hanseni as a true upwelling organism.

J	Oka, N				Oka, Nariko			Differential assimilation efficiency of prey and growth of Short-tailed Shearwater chicks	ORNITHOLOGICAL SCIENCE												Procellariiform seabirds accumulate large amounts of lipid during the nestling period. Chick obesity functions as a buffer against irregular attentiveness by parents delivering meals. Surprisingly the assimilation mechanism necessary to attain obesity remains unclear. This study presents the first measurements of assimilation efficiency in relation to age and diet throughout the long nestling period of a Procellariidae. To determine the assimilation efficiency and diet effects on growth, Short-tailed Shearwater Puffinus tenuirostris chicks were fed in captivity on different diets of marine organisms (krill Euphausia superba, squid Nototodarus sloani and fish Hyperlophus vittatus) from age 10 to 85 days. Assimilation efficiency was highest (mean 93.7%) among young chicks (10-29 days old) then declined, becoming stable (mean 80.9%) among older (70-85 days old) pre-fledging chicks. It was noted that the krill-fed chicks showed consistently higher assimilation efficiencies, not only when young (mean 95.4%) but also when older (mean 84.8%), than the squid-fed or fish-fed chicks (means 92.4-93.3% when young and 78.4-79.5% when older). The krill diet contributed to better growth in body mass (close to that of free-living chicks at the source colony), while the squid- and fish-fed chicks grew slowly. The dietary effects on feather growth and molting did not parallel those on body mass increments. Squid-fed chicks had similar feather growth rates and molt progress to those of krill-fed chicks, whereas fish-fed chicks often vomited their food when given sizable quantities of fish and had slower feather development and molting. These findings suggest that chicks may need parental digestive fluids in order to facilitate their digestion of larger amounts of fish, whereas they were competent to digest krill and squid on their own. When the diet of older (over 85 days of age) fish-fed chicks was changed to krill they stopped regurgitating food, gained weight and began rapid molting. Likewise, squid-fed chicks gained mass at a faster rate when they were switched to a diet of krill. The experimental Short-tailed Shearwater chicks were found to have a high absorption capability during the early nestling stage allowing for considerable lipid accumulation and resulting in obesity. This obesity facilitates the fasting necessary while their parents commute to distant nutritive waters. The shearwaters have a highly adaptive potential to assimilate krill, which are abundant organisms with a large biomass in the higher latitudes that shearwaters prefer to inhabit for foraging throughout the year. Even the krill-fed chicks, the best among the three experimental dietary groups, only attained similar body masses to free-living chicks despite being given 1.9 times as heavy meals as shearwater parents provided to their free-living chicks. This evidence indicates that in order for free-living Short-tailed Shearwater chicks to grow to obesity, they depend on a far higher energy intake than that available in their diet alone. The specific oil, accumulated in the shearwater parents' proventriculus, and delivered to the chick, is an important contribution. In other words, digestible prey, such as krill, and parental stomach oil, are both essential to insure obesity for Short-tailed Shearwater chicks.																	1347-0558					JUN	2011	10	1			SI		39	50									WOS:000292370100007						
J	La Mesa, M; Eastman, JT; Vacchi, M				La Mesa, M; Eastman, JT; Vacchi, M			The role of notothenioid fish in the food web of the Ross Sea shelf waters: a review	POLAR BIOLOGY												The Ross Sea, a large, high-latitude (72-78degreesS) embayment of the Antarctic continental shelf, averages 500 m deep, with troughs to 1,200 m and the shelf break at 700 m. It is covered by pack ice for 9 months of the year. The fish fauna of about 80 species includes primarily 4 families and 53 species of the endemic perciform suborder Notothenioidei. This review focuses on the diet and role in the food web of notothenioids and top-level bird and mammal predators, and also includes new information on the diets of artedidraconids and bathydraconids. Although principally a benthic group, notothenioids have diversified to form an adaptive radiation that includes pelagic and semipelagic species. In the southern Ross Sea, notothenioids dominate the fish fauna at levels of abundance and biomass >90% and are, therefore, inordinately important in the food web. Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) and mesopelagic fishes are virtually absent from the shelf waters of the Ross Sea. Of the four notothenioid families, nototheniids show the most ecological and dietary diversification, with pelagic, cryopelagic, epibenthic and benthic species. Neutrally buoyant Pleuragramma antarcticum constitutes >90% of both the abundance and biomass of the midwater fish fauna. Most benthic nototheniids are opportunistic and feed on seasonally or locally abundant zooplanktonic prey. Artedidraconids are benthic sit-and-wait predators. Larger bathydraconids are benthic predators on fish while smaller species feed mainly on benthic crustaceans. Channichthyids are less dependent on the bottom for food than other notothenioids. Some species combine benthic and pelagic life styles; others are predominantly pelagic and all consume euphausiids and/or fish. South polar skuas, Antarctic petrels, Adelie and emperor penguins, Weddell seals and minke and killer whales are the higher vertebrate components of the food web, and all prey on notothenioids to some extent. Based on the frequency of occurrence of prey items in the stomachs of fish, bird and mammal predators, P. antarcticum and ice krill E. crystallorophias are the key species in the food web of the Ross Sea. P. antarcticum is a component of the diet of at least 11 species of nototheniid, bathydraconid and channichthyid fish and, at frequencies of occurrence from 71 to 100%, is especially important for Dissostichus mawsoni, Gvozdarus svetovidovi and some channichthyids. At least 16 species of notothenioids serve as prey for bird and mammal predators, but P. antarcticum is the most important and is a major component of the diet of south polar skua, Adelie and emperor penguins and Weddell seals, at frequencies of occurrence from 26 to 100%. E. crystallorophias is consumed by some nototheniid and channichthyid fish and can be of importance in the diet of emperor and Adelie penguins, although in the latter case, this is dependent on location and time of year. Unlike the linear phytoplankton-->E. superba-->consumers of the E. superba food chain hypothesized for much of the Southern Ocean, the food web of the Ross Sea shelf is non-linear, with complex prey-predator interactions. Notothenioid fish play a key role: as predators, they occupy most of the trophic niches available in the ecosystem, relying on benthic, zooplanktonic and nektonic organisms; as prey, they are important food resources for each other and for most top predators living and foraging on the shelf. They also constitute the major link between lower (invertebrates) and higher (birds and mammals) levels of the food web. This is especially true for P. antarcticum. Along with E. crystallorophias, its ecological role in the Ross Sea is equivalent to that of myctophids and E. superba elsewhere in the Southern Ocean.

J	Pond, DW				Pond, David W.			The physical properties of lipids and their role in controlling the distribution of zooplankton in the oceans	JOURNAL OF PLANKTON RESEARCH												A new perspective on the role of lipids in zooplankton is proposed, with solidliquid phase transitions of lipids being a factor regulating their buoyancy. These phase transitions are controlled by zooplankton in relation to their physical environment, through the selective accumulation of specific lipids with optimum levels of unsaturation. The necessity to control buoyancy and maintain an optimum depth is a fundamental evolutionary force, driving anatomical, biochemical and behavioural adaptations of all organisms within the aquatic realm. It is hypothesized that each species adjusts the amount, composition and anatomical location of lipids, to maximize fitness according to their preferred habitat and life history traits. Recent discoveries regarding the role of phase transitions of lipids in marine zooplankton and their role in regulating buoyancy will require re-interpretation of existing data and stimulate future scientific endeavours in zooplankton research.																	0142-7873	1464-3774				JUN	2012	34	6					443	453		10.1093/plankt/fbs027							WOS:000303340700001						
J	Richoux, NB				Richoux, Nicole B.			Trophic ecology of zooplankton at a frontal transition zone: fatty acid signatures at the subtropical convergence, Southern Ocean	JOURNAL OF PLANKTON RESEARCH												Regional variations in fatty acid composition were assessed in zooplankton communities situated immediately north and south of the subtropical convergence (STC), where warm (maximum 21 degrees C) nutrient-poor waters of the southwest Indian Ocean converge with cool (minimum 11 degrees C) nutrient-rich subantarctic waters of the Southern Ocean. I hypothesized that food web structures differ from north to south based on average spatial differences in primary productivity, and that zooplankton in the more productive region show enhanced herbivorous feeding. Several taxonomic groups including euphausiids showed differences in their fatty acid signatures from north to south, indicating the existence of measurable within- and among-species differences in trophic relationships between the two communities, presumably stemming from variations in food quality and availability. The indices 22:6 omega 3/20:5 omega 3, 18:1 omega 9/18:1 omega 7 and Sigma omega 3/Sigma omega 6 indicated that carnivory was the dominant feeding mode in the north, whereas herbivory was more prevalent in the south, a pattern that was not detected in the same region using stable isotope ratios. Such conflicting results substantiate the importance of utilizing more than one method to investigate feeding relationships in aquatic systems. Fatty acid profiles of the amphipod Themisto gaudichaudii revealed some distinct herbivory markers, indicating more complex feeding habits by this important pelagic species than previously reported. My findings shed new light on the regional variations in zooplankton diet and food web dynamics in a poorly understood but critically important frontal zone bordering the Southern Ocean.

J	CLARKE, A; KENDALL, MA; GORE, DJ				CLARKE, A; KENDALL, MA; GORE, DJ			THE ACCUMULATION OF FLUORESCENT AGE PIGMENTS IN THE TROCHID GASTROPOD MONODONTA-LINEATA	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY												Several recent studies have shown the potential value of chloroform-soluble fluorescent age pigments (FAPs) in determining the age of marine invertebrates with no permanent hard parts. The primary assumption in estimating age from FAPs is that there is a linear (or at least monotonic) increase in FAP content with time. We have tested this assumption with the trochid gastropod Monodonta lineata, a species whose age can be established unequivocally from shell growth checks. Samples of 10 age classes (1.5-10.5 yr) were obtained and FAPs extracted from lyophilised cerebral ganglia and digestive gland. The fluorescence emission spectra were similar to those reported for other organisms, though the wavelength of maximum intensity varied with tissue, sex and age. Cerebral ganglia often showed two major emission peaks, digestive gland only one. Thin-layer chromatography indicated that at least three fluorescent compounds were present in the extracts. Digestive gland total FAP content did not vary for the first 5 yr of growth, but then trebled during the next 5 yr. The tissue concentration of FAP showed no statistically significant trend. Cerebral ganglia total FAP content increased during the first 5 yr then remained constant for the next 3 yr before declining. There was a steady decline in the concentration of cerebral ganglio FAP throughout life. These patterns indicate a complex relationship between FAP content and calendar age, and indicate that (at least in Monodonta) FAPs have little practical value for determining age.																	0022-0981						1990	144	2-3					185	204		10.1016/0022-0981(90)90028-B							WOS:A1990EP49800008

This study represents the first quantitative demonstration that these soluble autofluorescences, previously attributable to lipofuscin or fluorescent age pigment (FAP), actually bear no quantitative relationship to it at all. This result confirms previous suspicions in the literature. In some cases the intensities of these unidentified soluble autofluorescences are positive linear or curvilinear functions of or an or body weight and, therefore, may give the misleading impression that they are related to age and derived from age pigment. It is strongly recommended that researchers, particularly on aquatic species, avoid using the original biochemical assay procedure for lipofuscin and its more recent modifications.																	0531-5565					MAY-JUN	1996	31	3					421	432		10.1016/0531-5565(95)02034-9							WOS:A1996UN72800008	9415124

Predominant fatty acids were the polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA): eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), linoleic acid (LA), arachidonic acid (ARA), linolenic acid (LNA) together with the monounsaturated fatty acid 18:1 omega 9 and the saturated fatty acid 16:0. FA markers indicated that available food was constituted of incompletely degraded phytodetritus and terrestrial inputs, as well as animal remains. PUFA contents depended on the diet and the capacity of animals to desaturate and elongate LNA and LA in long chain PUFA as EPA and ARA respectively. Based on their FA compositions, we showed that gammarids represent naturally-occurring freshwater sources of essential PUFA, and could play a fundamental role in pelagic-benthic coupling and energy recycling in the ecosystem. The complexity of the feeding strategies of D. villosus - detritivorous, omnivorous, carnivorous - makes this species efficient at exploiting different components of the available food and may be a key factor in its high invasive success.

J	ENDO, Y				ENDO, Y			ORIENTATION OF ANTARCTIC KRILL IN AN AQUARIUM	NIPPON SUISAN GAKKAISHI												Acoustic methods appear to be the best way to estimate Antarctic krill abundance directly. Information on body orientation, however, is needed to obtain reliable krill acoustic target strength (TS) values, since TS varies with body orientation. Krill body orientation was measured in an aquarium aboard the R. V. Kaiyo Maru. Average body orientation was 45.6-degrees (SD = 19.6-degrees, N = 67), which was slightly less than that when animals were hovering, 49.7-degrees (SD = 7.5-degrees, N = 50). Such an acute angle of elevation would tend to reduce the reflected echo intensity when compared to animals swimming horizontally. Although mature females with marked swelling of the cephalothorax were not included in the experiment, the center of mass was found to be situated more to the anterior than in males and immature females. The hovering orientation, which is close to average body orientation, of mature males and mature females was estimated on the basis of Kils' model. Mature females with swollen cephalothorax demonstrated larger tilt angles relative to the horizontal plane than did males, as the center of mass is positioned more to the anterior and the pleopods are less developed in It is concluded that the orientation, and therefore TS, may differ according to the maturity stage composition of individual aggregations.																	0021-5392					MAR	1993	59	3					465	468									WOS:A1993KX82400009

Nyctiphanes simplex (Crustacea: Euphausiacea) temporal association of embryogenesis and early larval development with female molt and ovarian cycles	JOURNAL OF PLANKTON RESEARCH												Embryogenesis (single cell to twitching stage) and early larval stages (nauplius to calyptopis 3) internal morphology of the sac-spawning species Nyctiphanes simplex was investigated to explore its temporal association with gonad development and molt development cycles. Krill were collected and incubated shipboard in July 2007 and March 2010 in the Gulf of California. Cleavage patterns were similar to what is observed in broadcast-spawning species, suggesting a close phylogenetic consistency between krill species with distinct spawning strategies. Nyctiphanes simplex, like broadcast-spawning krill species, had eight Kranzzellen (K1K8) cells during the blastula stage. The gonad of ovigerous females with embryos in the cell division stage is in the multiplication stage (Stage I). From the nauplius stage, most females are in previtellogenesis (Stage II). Only females with metanauplii occasionally have gonads in vitellogenesis (Stage III). Gonad maturity (Stage IV) occurs only after the release of the embryos from the ovigerous sac. Females with an ovigerous sac were invariably at the intermolt stage, suggesting a precise synchronization among processes of molting, gonad development and embryo release to produce consecutive broods. Lipid and carbohydrate storage decreased exponentially throughout embryonic and early larval development, depending on their endogenous reserves. When metanauplii leave the ovigerous sac, they have low storage lipid (2) and carbohydrate (5). These proportions suggest a theoretically short period-of-no-return (2 days), when they transform into the first feeding stage (calyptopis 1).

However, various aspects related to currently adopted procedures remain untested and a distinct relationship between FAP accumulation and chronological age has yet to be established. The present study was undertaken to critically evaluate the effects of specimen and extract handling procedures (including temperature, time, ultrasonication, and solvent systems) on the expression of native FAP fluorescence using the post-mitotic tissues of laboratory-reared specimens of the teleost Oreochromis mossambicus as model systems. FAP-like fluorophores increased in vitro in brain, heart, and muscle tissues and their extracts with increased storage temperature (- 20-degrees-C and above) and time. Sonification of homogenates greatly enhanced this effect and generated other non-native fluorophores in sample solution. Fluorescence assay temperature also affected expression of results, and aqueous-phase extracts, used in previous studies, were found to contain large amounts of fluorescent flavin contaminants. Using modifications of the above procedures, age-related patterns of accumulation were subsequently examined in O. mossambicus brain and, for the first time, position correlations between chronological age and whole organ as well as weight-specific FAP concentration were validated. The significance of these findings are discussed in relation to previous FAP studies.																	0025-3162						1991	109	1					1	11		10.1007/BF01320225							WOS:A1991FM85100001

Among the most useful traits for successful establishment in a new ecosystem are the size of the invader and its diet and feeding habits. During the last twenty years, Dikerogammarus villosus has been one of the most successful invaders of large European rivers and lakes. However, regarding feeding habits, results were confusing and sometimes contradictory. In this study, we attempt to define the feeding strategy of D. villosus using their FA content according to sex and the seasonal and the spatial variation in its feeding habit. Our results indicated that D. villosus is rather unspecialized with plasticity in its feeding behaviour, switching between different functional feeding groups depending on seasons, habitats and available resources. The selection of high quality resources may hence provide a strong advantage during the invasion process by optimizing the growth and the reproduction of the invader.

J	Varpe, O				Varpe, Oystein			Fitness and phenology: annual routines and zooplankton adaptations to seasonal cycles	JOURNAL OF PLANKTON RESEARCH												Behaviour and life-history strategies of zooplankton have evolved in response to seasonal cycles in food availability, predation risk and abiotic conditions. A key challenge is to understand how different activities over the year are linked. For instance, how does a change in spring activities, such as the timing or amount of egg production, influence autumn activities, for instance energy storage or migration? Trade-offs viewed in relation to individual lifetime fitness consequences couple these events. The framework of optimal annual routines provides theory and methodology for consistent analyses of these temporal trade-offs. Here I describe the key parts of optimal annual routine models and how the models can be used to: (i) study phenology, life-history strategies, and population dynamics; (ii) predict responses to environmental change; and (iii) guide future zooplankton studies. I mainly discuss the adaptations of zooplankton species inhabiting high latitude oceans where the seasonal cycle and its effects are particularly strong. Empirical challenges include issues of seasonal resolution, state-dependent processes and individual variability. Two ecological problems with avenues for future work are discussed in particular detail: the role of sea ice and ice algae in the life cycle of copepods and krill, and the adaptive value and ecological consequences of semelparous versus iteroparous reproductive strategies.

Trophic effects of fishing southern rock lobster Jasus edwardsii shown by combined fatty acid and stable isotope analyses	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												The southern rock lobster Jasus edwardsii is a commercial species that has benefited from the complete protection offered by no-take reserves, with higher abundances and larger animals recorded in reserves than in adjacent fished areas. What remains unclear is whether there is any change in the diet of lobsters in reserves, for example, as a result of increased intraspecific competition for food. We used combined chemical tracers to examine the diet of lobsters in fished and reserve areas in 2 bioregions in eastern Tasmania. delta N-15 values of lobsters were richer in fished than in reserve areas, indicating that lobsters eat a greater proportion of food items from higher trophic levels in fished areas. Mixing models suggest that ascidians, sea urchins and the turbinid gastropod were all important food sources for lobsters, but the importance of these food items differed between bioregions. This spatial variability may suggest that the small size of the reserve in one bioregion is inadequate at ensuring the diet of lobsters is protected from fishing pressure, Fatty acid profiles of lobsters supported the importance of these food sources to lobsters. Differences between bioregions, or inside and outside of reserves, were not apparent using fatty acids. The present study highlights that lobster fishing has the capacity to alter the trophic status of prey for generalist predators and suggests that fatty acid analyses may be limited in detecting changes in the dietary composition of such generalist feeders.

Little has been reported previously on the determination of molecular weight using high-performance gel-permeation chromatography (HPGPC) and no attempt has been devoted to an examination of molecular weight distribution. An HPGPC method for evaluating the above-mentioned parameters for chitosan samples having different molecular weights and different degrees of acetylation was therefore developed. Calibration using sodium polystyrene sulfonate commercial standards of narrow molecular weight distribution could not be carried out in the solvent system used for chitosan. Calibration was therefore performed by means of chitosan samples obtained by depolymerization.																	0008-6215					DEC 28	1993	250	2					301	314		10.1016/0008-6215(93)84008-T							WOS:A1993MT47400008

The lipid yields were 5.08% in step 1, 4.80% in step 2, and 9.11% in step 3, with a total of 18.99%. The krill oil extracted with acetone in step 1 (A-KO) contained the lowest contents of phospholipids (PL) (2.32%) and n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) (16.63%), but the highest levels of minor components (505.00 mg/kg of astaxanthin, 29.39 mg/100 g of tocopherols, 34.32 mg/100 g of vitamin A and 27.95 mg/g of cholesterol). By contrast, despite having traces of minor components, the krill oil extracted using ethanol in step 3 (E-KO) was the most abundant in PL (59.52%) and n-3 PUFA (41.74%). The krill oil extracted using hexane in step 2 (H-KO) expressed medium contents of all the testing indices. The oils showed significant differences in the antioxidant capacity (E-KO > H-KO > A-KO) which exhibited positive correlation with the PL content. These results could be used for further development of a wide range of krill oil products with tailor-made functions.

Data were obtained using a single instrument, the hydrobiophysical system Salpa-M, in the area of 50-63 degrees S, 62-49 degrees W in March 2002 (183 soundings at 45 stations during cruise 7 on RV Gorizont) and in February 2020 (122 soundings at 18 stations during cruise 79 on RV Academic Mstislav Keldysh). The bioluminescence studies were coupled with the simultaneous measurement of temperature, electrical conductivity, and photosynthetically active radiation, and they were compared with the data from processing plankton samples. Over the past 20 years, as a consequence of the appearance of a large number of gelatinous organisms and the resulting changes in the structure of the plankton community, the bioluminescence of Antarctic waters in the euphotic layer of this region has decreased almost two-fold, currently being in the range 8.4 x 10(-12) to 104.42 x 10(-12) W center dot cm(-2)center dot L-1.

The hydrogen bonds of SA/AKP composite material were analyzed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) and Nuclear magnetic resonance hydrogen spectrum (HNMR). Experiment manifested the existence of intermolecular and intramolecular hydrogen bonds in SA/AKP system; strength of intermolecular hydrogen bond enhanced with the increase of AKP in the composite material and the interaction strength of hydrogen bonding followed the order: OH... Ether 0 > OH...pi > OH...N. The percentage of intermolecular hydrogen bond decreased with increase of pH. At the same time, the effect of hydrogen bonds on properties of the composite material was discussed. The increase of intermolecular hydrogen bonding led to the decrease of crystallinity, increase of apparent viscosity and surface tension, as well as obvious decrease of heat resistance of SA/AKP composite material. SA/ARP fiber SEM images and energy spectrum showed that crystallized salt was separated from the fiber, which possibly led to the fibrillation of the composite fibers. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Because the effects of nitrifying bacteria are limited by the extremely low temperature of about 0degreesC, biological filtration does not keep up with the deterioration of water quality resulting from the excrement of animals and un-eaten food. It is therefore necessary to exchange seawater frequently in our present cold-water aquarium. We developed a new system at Port of Nagoya Public Aquarium (PNPA) that keeps Antarctic marine animals in good condition. The improved system increases the temperature of sea water to 10degreesC prior to biological filtration and thereby increases the effectiveness of the biological filter. The krill-rearing container was constructed inside the main tank so that the water flow inside the rearing container could be stopped. This avoids a rapid reduction of phytoplankton feed due to turnover of the seawater in the system while krill were fed. As a result of these improvements, long-term rearing, mass culture and reproduction of Antarctic krill are possible. We have exhibited Antarctic marine animals since the opening of PNPA in 1992, and we have exhibited Antarctic krill continuously since 1997. In this article, we detail the Antarctic krill breeding facilities at PNPA.																	1023-6244	1029-0362				DEC	2003	36	4					249	258		10.1080/10236240310001623637							WOS:000187994400006

Am. 86, 691-705 (1989)]. Exercise of the model under assumption of an orientation distribution allows absolute predictions of target strength to be made at each frequency. By requiring that the difference between predicted and measured target strengths be a minimum in a least-squares sense, it is possible to infer the orientation distribution. This useful biological quantity was not obtainable in the previous analysis which involved the sphere scattering model.

Krill have long been recognized as key prey species for fish, birds, and marine mammals and as a target for fisheries in both hemispheres. However. the study of krill can contribute in many other areas of biology. Krill are an excellent model system for studies of growth and maturity, for connections between theory, experiment, and observation, and for tests of evolutionary theory in the field. Krill are also ideal model organisms for studying the interaction between environmental and organismal variability. Because they are widely distributed but only moderately speciose, the study of krill can also shed light on the relationship between abundance and range. The study of krill is an inherently interdisciplinary field, crossing boundaries and using a combination of oceanography, biochemistry, physiology, evolution, and ecology to understand krill and their role in the ecosystem.																	0706-652X						2000	57			3			1	5		10.1139/cjfas-57-S3-1							WOS:000166531600001

The analysis has addressed the problems of whether krill swarms in a small area may be of a limited number of types, and whether the biological characteristics of the krill could be related to the echo-sounder measurements of the swarm. The main sources of biological variation between krill in different swarms seemed to be related to size and maturity. Krill swarms did not appear to form groups based on biological similarity, and swarms caught in the same haul were as different as swarms caught in different hauls. However, swarms could be divided into groups on the basis of time of day and swarm depth. The biological features (size, maturity, sex ratio and moult stage) of krill in the swarms were not related to echo-sounder observations (horizontal and vertical extent, depth and density of swarms), although some degree of separation between swarms containing large and small krill may be possible if the shape of the swarms is considered. Information on biological characteristics of krill in swarms must still be collected using nets.																	0198-0149					FEB	1992	39	2A					359	&		10.1016/0198-0149(92)90113-8							WOS:A1992HH58600015

Here, we investigate interspecific, interannual, and geographic variability in the diets and trophic positions of these copepods using a combination of fatty acids and stable isotopes. To characterize geographic variability in diet, we compare our findings from the Strait of Georgia with similar data from Ocean Station P in the subarctic northeast Pacific. Both fatty acid and stable isotope signatures indicate the existence of three trophic levels, even within the limited size range of these copepods: Neocalanus plumchrus and Calanus marshallae are primarily omnivorous, while Euchaeta elongata is carnivorous and Eucalanus bungii is herbivorous. Fatty acid markers of trophic position (e.g., DHA/EPA, 18:1n-9/18:1n-7) correlate significantly with delta N-15, while markers indicating the proportion of diatoms to flagellates in the diet (e.g., 16PUFA/18PUFA and DHA/EPA) correlate significantly with delta C-13, after the effect of lipid concentration on delta C-13 is accounted for. Despite the general correlation between stable isotopes and fatty acids, the former are not sensitive enough to capture the range of interannual variability observed in the latter, and can only capture substantial shifts in the diet over geographic scales. However, regardless of variability in food quality, the relative trophic positions of these copepods do not change significantly either spatially or temporally.

Yeast diets contained spray-dried untreated P. rhodozyma, heat-treated and spray-dried P. rhodozyma, and heat-treated and chemically treated spray-dried P. rhodozyma. Growth, weight, and fork length of all fish increased linearly with feeding and were not significantly different at the end of the study. Astaxanthin concentration in all pigmented fish increased linearly and ranged from 3.26 to 3.78 mg/kg after 150 d of feeding. Apart from the nonpigmented diet, astaxanthin concentration was not significantly different between fish fed the untreated or treated red yeast and those fed the synthetic astaxanthin diet (control). Assessment of astaxanthin isomers corroborated the assimilation of the (3R,3'R) isomer from all P. rhodozyma diets. Moisture, ash, and protein in all fish declined linearly with time, whereas lipid increased, but only during the first 30 d of feeding. Fatty acid profiles of all fish were virtually identical and independent of the source of pigment. No beneficial or adverse nutritional effects to the fish resulted from the use of modified red yeast.																	1522-2055					JAN	2001	63	1					52	57		10.1577/1548-8454(2001)063<0052:PACOFO>2.0.CO;2							WOS:000167944700009

The proportion of green krill (individuals discoloured due to active feeding on phytoplankton) had significant regressions with chlorophyll-a concentrations in micro- and nano-size fractions. Between these two fractions, chlorophyll-a concentration in the micro-size fraction showed the higher partial regression coefficient.

Atlantic salmon (mean weight 0.5 kg) were divided into four triplicate groups and fed a commercial fish meal based diets with 0, 100, 200 and 300 g krill kg(-1) feed, respectively, for 12 weeks. The fluoride concentrations in the experimental feeds were analysed to be 18, 132, 235 and 358 mg kg(-1), respectively. Growth, mortality and feed efficiency were recorded through the experiment. Fluoride concentration was measured in muscle, whole-body, and bone initially and after 12 weeks of feeding. The fluoride concentrations in the samples were determined by alkali fusion and fluoride ion-selective electrode. Growth, mortality and feed efficiency ratio were not affected by the dietary treatments. The results showed that fluoride concentration in muscle, whole body and bone were not affected by the dietary fluoride level. The fluoride concentration in the tissues showed great variation among replicates of the group given the same diet. Fillets of the fish varied between 0.3 and 1.4 mg fluoride kg(-1) wet weight, whereas the whole-body concentration of fluoride varied between 3.3 and 6.1 mg kg(-1) wet weight and the fluoride bone concentration varied between 5.8 and 7.2 mg kg(-1) fresh weight. These results suggest that Atlantic salmon are highly tolerant of dietary fluoride given as krill meal with concentration of fluoride up to 350 mg kg(-1) diet, and that accumulation of fluoride from feeding diets containing krill meal does not lead to tissue accumulation in the fish, at least over a short period of time.

Commercial fishing operations concentrated on the outer shelf in the early 1980s, along the shelf slope in the mid to late 1980s, and from the shelf across to the outer shelf in the early to late 1990s. Intra-annually, trawling positions generally started from the outer shelf and proceeded towards the shelf later in the season. Trawling positions seemed to be primarily governed by the distribution of larger mature krill, especially at the beginning of fishing operations each season. In summer, biological factors that affect product quality, such as salp abundance and the proportion of green krill, also seemed to have an increasing effect on trawling positions. Ice conditions for recent fishing periods were also demonstrated to have an effect.

This study verified the thermal stability of the TGase from 0-80 degrees C. Fluorescence and CD spectra studies confirmed tertiary structural damage at 40 degrees C, alpha-helix reduction at 60 degrees C, and refolding during cooling to 20 degrees C. The TGase sequence was obtained by transcriptomics and used to build its structure. Its catalytic triad was Cys333-His403-Asp426 and its catalytic process was inferred from the model. Molecular dynamics simulation illustrated that its cold activity resulted from its flexible active site, while high thermostability was conferred by an overall rigid structure, a large amount of stable Val and Lys, and strong electrostatic interactions at the N- and C- terminals. This study fills gaps in the correlation of conformational changes with stability and activity of TGase.

Considering the effects of acid species, concentration, temperature, extraction time, solvent volume on the defluoridation efficiency, and final product yield, a new multistage counter current extraction method was developed. The optimum reaction condition was obtained by adding 10 ml of 0.3 M HCl to 1 g defatted krill powder and extracting for four stages, each stage was lasting for 60 min. After this process, fluoride content per dry weight of the final product was remarkably reduced to <5 mg/kg, defluoridation efficiency was 99.70%, and water consumption was minimized. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy also indicated a decrease in the amount of fluorine, and basic chemical composition measurement indicated krill protein was not damaged during this process. Therefore, these results could be used as theoretical guidance for removing fluoride in practical application. Practical applications Defatted Antarctic krill powder is a cheap by-product after krill oil extraction, but it contains both high-quality protein and high concentration of fluoride. The toxicity of fluoride in krill powder makes it not be allowed as food resource. So, a new counter current extraction method was developed to defluorinate from defatted krill powder, which was an easy and cheap process, but high defluoridation efficiency with low water consumption. It has been successfully applied to the food pilot base, and it would help to obtain the safe defatted Antarctic krill powder in krill industry.

A description of the post-naupliar development of Southern Ocean krill (Thysanoessa macrura)	POLAR BIOLOGY												Southern Ocean krill (Thysanoessa macrura) is one of the most abundant euphausiid species in the Southern Ocean. Despite a wide distribution and high abundance this species remains poorly understood. Unique ecological traits of this species, including a late-winter reproductive period, highly omnivorous diet and large lipid deposits within the carapace, suggest T. macrura is attuned to the seasonal patterns of the Southern Ocean. The absence of the descriptions of T. macrura larval stages limits the development of a comprehensive understanding of the early life-history of this species. Here, I provide the first detailed descriptions of the post-naupliar larval developmental stages of T. macrura with accompanying photographic documentation. Three calyptopis and 6 furcilia stages were identified and described for T. macrura, providing an accessible guide for their identification in both historical samples and for future investigations.

This squeezed fluid adjusted to pH 7 was subjected to spontaneous autolysis by storing at different temperatures (20-45-degrees-C) and times (10-48 h). The autolyzed material resulted in 3 distinct phases after high speed centrifugation. The intermediate phase (water-phase) was collected and concentrated by membrane filtration. The high-molecular-weight substances (> 10 000 Daltons) were further purified by ion-exchange chromatography and eluted by a salt gradient. In this matter a bulk enzymatic material from krill can be efficiently obtained for further purification of different hydrolytic enzymes (peptide hydrolases/carbohydrases).																	0032-7484						1991	21	4					237	256		10.1080/10826069108018576							WOS:A1991GW40800006	1780275

Compared to many other marine organisms, the level of PL was markedly high. The major fatty acids in the TAG of E. pacifica were saturated fatty acids (SFA, 14:0 and 16:0), monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA, 16:1 and 18: 1), and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA, 18:4 n - 3 and 20:5 n - 3, icosapentaenoic acid: EPA). The only fatty acids found in the tissue PL were SFA (16:0), MUFA (18: 1), and PUFA (20:4 n - 6, arachidonic acid: A-A, EPA, and 22:6 n - 3, docosahexaenoic acids: DHA). The comparatively high levels of 14:0,16:0,16:1 n - 7,16:2 n - 4,16:4 n - 1, 18:1 n - 7, 18:1 n - 9, 18:4 n - 3, and EPA in the TAG may be affected by the lipid composition of its phytoplankton prey, such as diatoms, which generally contain high amounts of these fatty acids. The levels of short chain 14:0, 16:1 n - 7, 16:2 n - 4, 16:4 n - 1, 18:1 n - 9, and 18:4 n - 3 decreased in PL, while A-A, EPA, and DHA increased. In particular, the levels of n - 3 PUFA in PL were markedly high in all specimens. The mean proportion of EPA plus DHA accounted for more than 45% (55.0% in PE and 47.7% in PC) of the total fatty acids. These results suggest that E. pacifica, which contains markedly high levels of EPA and DHA, may biosynthesize these PUFA by carbon chain elongation and desaturation or selectively accumulate n - 3 PUFA. In addition, their lipids may be an important source of n - 3 PUFA for higher marine animals, such as the pelagic marine fishes (sardines, anchovies, and other small fishes), which mainly prey on these euphausiids. Marine fish accumulate high levels of these n - 3 PUFA because they are unable to synthesize DHA. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Of particular interest was the positional distribution of the polyunsaturated n-3 fatty acids in milk triacylglycerols (TG). In adipocytes of pinnipeds, TG are synthesized with the n-3 fatty acids primarily in the sn-1,3 positions. To determine the positional distribution, extracts of enzymatically digested lipids were separated by thin-layer chromatography, and the constituent fatty acids were separated and quantified by gas-liquid chromatography. Monoenoic and saturated fatty acids comprised over 75% of the total, the ratio of monoenoic to saturated fatty acids being 2:1. The percent content of the long-chain n-3 fatty acids, 20:5, 22:5 and 22:6, ranged between 15-20%. The positional analyses revealed that at the sn-2 position of milk TG, saturated fatty acids were in excess (57%), and the content of n-3 fatty acids was less than 5%. More than 80% of the n-3 fatty acids in milk were located in the sn-1,3 positions. The data indicate that in pinnipeds TG are synthesized in the mammary gland and adipose tissue with fatty acids having similar positional distributions.

J	Kirsch, J; Thomas, GL; Cooney, RT				Kirsch, J; Thomas, GL; Cooney, RT			Acoustic estimates of zooplankton distributions in Prince William Sound, spring 1996	FISHERIES RESEARCH												A survey was conducted in Prince William Sound (PWS) in May 1996, to study the volume backscattering of zooplankton using a 420 kHz digital sonar and a multiple opening-closing net environmental sampling system (MOCNESS). While the digital sonar provided continuous fine-scale volume scattering strength measurements, the MOCNESS samples provided zooplankton species, size, and coarse-scale estimates of density and distribution. This catch information was applied to acoustic scattering models to predict zooplankton volume backscattering strength. By least-squares fitting the predicted backscatter values with the measured acoustic backscatter, we determined the reflection coefficients for Neocalanus, pteropods, and eupausiids to be 0.0178, 0.1533, and 0.0341, respectively. By applying these reflection `coefficients and the measured animal sizes to the same acoustic models, we were able to calculate target strengths (TSs) for these tars, which were then applied to the volume scattering information, yielding estimates of the absolute densities of those selected species along continuous transects inside and outside PWS, The comparison of these density values with the density estimates from the MOCNESS showed reasonable agreement, although the distribution of acoustic values was much wider than the MOCNESS due to finer sampling. Since reflection coefficients vary from species to species, it is inappropriate to borrow this value from another species based on similarity. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

BIOLOGY LETTERS												Antarctic krill embryos and larvae were experimentally exposed to 380 (control), 1000 and 2000 mu atm pCO(2) in order to assess the possible impact of ocean acidification on early development of krill. No significant effects were detected on embryonic development or larval behaviour at 1000 mu atm pCO(2); however, at 2000 mu atm pCO(2) development was disrupted before gastrulation in 90 per cent of embryos, and no larvae hatched successfully. Our model projections demonstrated that Southern Ocean sea water pCO(2) could rise up to 1400 mu atm in krill's depth range under the IPCC IS92a scenario by the year 2100 (atmospheric pCO(2) 788 mu atm). These results point out the urgent need for understanding the pCO(2)-response relationship for krill developmental and later stages, in order to predict the possible fate of this key species in the Southern Ocean.

Differences between spatial distribution patterns of different krill aggregation forms in relation to water mass structure and dynamics were revealed. Distributional features and physical characteristics of some 2 400 krill swarms detected in the study area were sized acoustically and are described in this paper. Results of comparisons of swarm parameters by area and season are given. The effect of spatial distribution patterns of krill aggregations on the horizontal and vertical distribution of krill biomass is shown. About 64% of the krill biomass was concentrated in krill swarms in the upper 80 m depth layer within meander and eddy zones of the Weddell Sea (14% of the study area). Spatial distribution patterns of krill aggregations and distribution of krill biomass density were analysed with a view to detecting potential fishing grounds where the recommended precautionary catch limit could be taken. Such fishing grounds could be located within the zones in which swarms were concentrated and where the biomass density was greater than 1.5 g m(-3). The biomass in these potential fishing grounds amounted to about 1.7 million tonnes. It was shown that the removal of biomass up to a recommended precautionary limit could be possible from such grounds despite a predicted low catch per hour of trawling.																	1023-4063						2002	9						145	164									WOS:000179438500011

Use of sea ice by arctic terns Sterna paradisaea in Antarctica and impacts of climate change	JOURNAL OF AVIAN BIOLOGY												Arctic terns spend their breeding and non-breeding seasons in polar environments at opposite ends of the world. The sensitivity of polar regions to climate change makes it essential to understand the ecology of arctic terns but the remoteness of the Antarctic presents a considerable challenge. One solution is to use 'biologgers' to monitor remotely their behaviour and distribution in the Antarctic. Data from birds tagged with light-level global location sensors (geolocators) in 2015 and 2017 showed that a third of their annual cycle was spent amongst Antarctic sea ice. After reaching the East Antarctic in the austral spring, they gradually moved west, foraging in fragmented ice zones of the Antarctic coastline, leaving in the austral autumn for their return northward migration via the Atlantic. Changes in patterns of movement between phases of 24-h daylight and diel day/night conditions were likely linked to the annual moult, and stable isotope analyses suggest that krill (Euphausia species) was an important component of their diet. There were marked differences in movement behaviour between arctic terns tagged in 2015 compared to 2017 that may relate to unusual changes in sea-ice extent. The arctic tern may be unique amongst seabirds that utilise the Antarctic environment in summer in being able to move widely without nesting constraints, and may present a means of characterising the effects of climate change on species dependent for foraging on Antarctic sea-ice and krill.

In addition, a total of 135 Rectangular Midwater Trawls (RMT8) were undertaken to determine the structure of the krill population and to validate acoustic target detection techniques. This paper reports a comparison of the density estimates derived from net and acoustic sampling for a range of spatial scales; from individual net hauls to regional estimates of krill biomass. The different sources of error and the different characteristics of the density estimates from net and acoustic techniques are also defined. Direct quantitative comparisons of net and acoustic densities are shown to be inappropriate at both the small scale (i.e. individual net tows; the typical net sampling unit for census surveys) and the large scale (i.e. regional surveys). Therefore, a direct comparison of density estimates from net and acoustic surveys is not practicable for retrospective analysis of krill abundance. However, the results of net and acoustic surveys do appear comparable in terms of trends in krill distribution at the large scale. Therefore, the combined use of net and acoustic data can be useful in the analysis of interannual trends in the variability of krill distribution at the regional level. At the local level, data from trawl surveys using comparable nets can be used to examine interannual variability in krill distribution as there has been little change in the methodology used for net surveys over the last 25 years.

Estimates of growth rates of the Southern Ocean euphausiid Thysanoessa macrura are currently restricted to limited studies which rely upon repeated sampling and length-frequency analysis to quantify growth rates. The instantaneous growth method (IGR) was used to measure the growth rate of T. macrura successfully in the southern Kerulen Plateau region during summer, providing the first IGR parameters for the Southern Ocean euphausiid species. Results of the four-day IGR incubation indicate a period of low somatic growth for adult T. macrura. Males had a longer intermoult period (IMP) (62 days) than females (42 days), but the sexes exhibited similar daily growth rates of 0.011 mm day(-1) and 0.012 mm day(-1) respectively. Juveniles exhibited the fastest growth, with an IMP of 13 days and daily growth rate of 0.055 mm day(-1) indicating a prolonged growth season, similar to the Antarctic krill E. superba. Consequently, we highlight the usability of the IGR method and strongly encourage its use in developing a comprehensive understanding of spatial and seasonal growth patterns of T. macrura.

The presence of 1.5% and 2.5% calcium (CaCO3) in the diet - 1.0 and 2.0% above the minimum recommended content respectively significantly reduced the bioavailability of fluoride from krill paste.

Novel approach to describing the growth trajectory	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												Von Bertalanffy (VB) growth models for Antarctic krill have been calibrated from population-level data consisting of modal lengths obtained from a time sequence of length frequency samples. We developed an alternative approach to predicting the trajectory of length over time, using a step-growth function that combines models of instantaneous growth rate (IGR) at moult calibrated from direct measurements of individual pre- and post-moult krill sampled from the wild with a model of temperature-dependent inter-moult period (IMP), Using summer and early autumn data for juveniles and males sampled from the Indian Ocean sector of the Southern Ocean, we modelled IGR as a function of pre-moult length and season using linear mixed models (LMM) incorporating cubic smoothing splines. We generated a number of growth trajectories starting from an Age 1+ yr mean length, for different scenarios of winter and spring growth. We then provided convenient parametric approximations to these step trajectories for use in population dynamic modelling systems using either a punctuated-growth model based on an F-distribution or a seasonal-growth VB model. Alternatively, step-trajectories could be used directly. Our models indicated that, when allowing for shrinkage, at the start of the sixth winter after hatch (Age 5+ yr) the mean length of krill for the Indian Ocean sector was close to 53 mm, compared to 56 mm obtained from studies for the southwest Atlantic Ocean sector. In contrast, when shrinkage was not allowed for, a slightly higher mean length was obtained for krill from the Indian Ocean sector (57.5 mm) compared to krill from the southwest Atlantic Ocean sector.

At -18-degrees-C cod reaches the limit of salability after 9 months; saithe after 4 months. Changes in lipid hydrolysis, lipid oxidation, protein denaturation and degradation of trimethylamine oxide (TMAO) were followed over 12 and 8 months storage at -18-degrees-C in the two species. The main differences between species were found in thiobarbituric acid (TBA) values, which increased in saithe after a short period of frozen storage to reach a maximum of 0.8-mu-g/g and remained unchanged in cod throughout the time of the experiment on a level of 0.1-mu-g/g. Thus an oxidative degradation of lipids may be the most likely cause of the different shelf lives of the two fish species.																	0003-9063					AUG	1991	41	1					89	99									WOS:A1991GL20400003

Visual inspection of freshly caught and captive animals suggests that their appendages, particularly the antennae and antennules, are often subject to injury. We have developed a novel method for reducing physical damage to captive krill based on their reported reaction to feeding whales. This method involves creating a bubble curtain that keeps the krill in the centre of the tank and away from potentially damaging hard surfaces. There was no difference in the length of the antennae between any of the captive animals. Trends in the data suggest that the antennules of krill maintained in a 200 L bubble curtain tank and a1000 L holding tank, were longer and less variable in length, than for krill in a 200 L tank with no bubble curtain. Freshly caught krill from the field were found to have damage to both antennae and antennules. The implications of these findings for husbandry of krill and for behavioural studies in the laboratory are discussed.																	1023-6244					DEC	2003	36	4					285	293		10.1080/10236240310001614411							WOS:000187994400009

In both enzymes, activity is maximal at a temperature around 50-degrees-C. Compared with Pagurus, the protease in Clibanarius is characterized by a considerably higher stability at elevated temperatures. Furthermore, the latter is less inhibited by two specific trypsin inhibitors. On an energetical level, distinct differences between the species are displayed. In both species, K(m) is strongly affected by temperature; lowest K(m) values do not coincide with the mean environmental temperature. The affinity of Pagurus protease for substrate at 40-degrees-C is about 17 times that at 0-degrees-C; in Clibanarius this factor amounts only to 4.4. At temperatures > 10-degrees-C, activation energy in the tropical species Clibanarius is distinctly higher (28.3 kJ.mol-1) than in the boreal species Pagurus (20.0 kJ.mol-1).																	0174-3597						1992	46	1					45	52		10.1007/BF02366211							WOS:A1992HW91000004

Fifty four taxa of fish belonging to 11 families were collected. The diets of 2101 fish representing 38 taxa were examined. These were classified into three categories, fish feeders, krill feeders and benthos feeders. Fish prey species fed on krill and/or benthos. Krill was a major dietary component for 32 (84.2%) out of 38 taxa. Gobionotothen gibberifrons was distributed at all 10 stations (100-800 m in depth) and its diet comprised krill and benthos. The present findings verify the importance of krill in the Antarctic marine ecosystem and indicate that krill is consumed by benthic fish at greater depths than previously reported.																	0954-1020					DEC	1997	9	4					407	413		10.1017/S0954102097000527							WOS:000074000500007

Three trypsins were isolated from the gastric fluid and two of them, C. p. TryII and C. p. TryIII, were purified to homogeneity by anion-exchange chromatography and crystallized by hanging-drop vapour diffusion. Diffraction data were collected at a synchrotron to 0.97 and 3.2 angstrom resolution, respectively. The crystal of C. p. TryII belongs to the orthorhombic space group P2(1)2(1)2(1), with unit-cell parameters a = 52.06, b = 62.00, c = 71.66 angstrom. Based on the Matthews coefficient, one protein molecule per asymmetric unit is suggested. In contrast, crystals of C. p. TryIII, which belong to the cubic space group P213 with unit-cell parameters a = b = c = 215.4 angstrom, are assumed to contain 12 molecules per asymmetric unit.

The pH optimum is approximately 5.5, and the temperature optimum is approximately 45 degrees dg-50 degrees dgC, as determined from crude extract The enzyme remains stable even after a 2-h incubation at 20 degrees or 40 degrees C. The K-m determined for methylumbelliferyl-N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminide and p-nitrophenyl-N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminide is 61.5 mu M and 359.6 mu M, respectively. Activation energy is significantly less for lower temperatures (5 degrees-18 degrees C) than for higher temperatures (18 degrees-40 degrees C). Investigation of the effect of acclimation temperature on chitobiase activities reveals no significant differences in activities between 10 degrees and 18 degrees C for populations raised at different temperatures. A similar pattern in the Q(10)'s was also observed. There was no evidence of any isozyme effect for populations raised at 6 degrees, 10 degrees, 18 degrees, or 25 degrees C. Attempts to protect the enzyme with various osmotic solutions and the results of differential centrifugation suggest that at least some of the enzyme is packaged in vesicles and/or lysosomes. Maximal chitobiase activity of asynchronous populations fed ad lib. overestimates the flux of N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminide (NAG)fro in the old to the new cuticle by approximately 100X. Chitobiase activity modulates significantly over the molt cycle in Daphnia, with a fivefold increase in activity 6-0 h before molt. This suggests that chitobiase activity, may provide an index of molt rate in asynchronously molting populations.																	0031-935X					SEP-OCT	1995	68	5					727	748		10.1086/physzool.68.5.30163928							WOS:A1995RV96200001

Effects of low crude oil chronic exposure on the northern krill (Meganyctiphanes norvegica)	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY												Chronic oil pollution related to gas and oil drilling activities is increasing in the sea due to the rising offshore petroleum industry activity. Among marine organisms, zooplankton play a crucial role in the marine ecosystem and therefore understanding the effects of crude oil chronic exposure on zooplankton is needed to determine the impact of oil in marine environments. The present study reports on the effect of crude oil on adult northern krill, Meganyctiphanes norvegica, collected during three seasons. Their sensitivity to oil was examined with oil concentration of 0.01 versus 0.1 mg oil L-1 and photo-modified oil in flowing seawater maintained in the dark for 2 weeks at in situ temperature. Oil (polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, PAHs) entered the krill (on average, 350 and 4400 mu g.kg(-1) wet weight in low and medium oil treatments respectively) and a larger fraction of the krill exhibited digestive gland pathologies (enhanced apoptosis and pathology of digestive tubules) in oil treatments (27-80%) compared to a significantly lower fraction (7-13%) in treatments that received no oil. However, 2-week oil exposure at these concentrations did not significantly decrease survivorship or impair basic functioning such as feeding and respiration rates. Similarly, there were only limited changes in the transcription of 7 selected genes from head tissue. Additionally, although there was significant seasonal variation in krill total lipid content and fatty acid composition, there was no treatment effect on both these parameters, which suggests limited oxidative stress under experimental conditions. Furthermore, there was no significant treatment effect on two direct measures of oxidative stress (MDA: malondialdehyde and AOPP: advanced oxidation protein products) in any of the seasons. Nevertheless, histology clearly revealed enhanced digestive gland pathologies in krill even at low concentrations. Although krill with such pathologies continue to survive, their accumulation of PAHs may be transferred up the food chain, impacting their predators and the wider ecosystem.				moodley, leon/AAH-1674-2019	Bechmann, Renee Katrin/0000-0002-7113-4386; Moodley, Leon/0000-0002-0617-3514												0022-0981	1879-1697				MAR	2018	500						120	131		10.1016/j.jembe.2017.07.003							WOS:000426230500014						
J	Mesquita, SR; Guilhermino, L; Guimaraes, L				Mesquita, Sofia Raquel; Guilhermino, Lucia; Guimaraes, Laura			Biochemical and locomotor responses of Carcinus maenas exposed to the serotonin reuptake inhibitor fluoxetine	CHEMOSPHERE												The aim of this study was to assess the effects of the widely used anti-depressant fluoxetine on behaviour (locomotion), moulting, neuromuscular transmission, energy production and anti-oxidant defences' efficiency of the epibenthic crab Carcinus mamas. Crabs were individually exposed to fluoxetine concentrations for 7 d. Effects on locomotion were assessed at the end of the exposure using an open field test adapted to C. maenas in the present study. Tissue samples were later collected to evaluate fluoxetine effects on physiological functions using the activity of key enzymes and other parameters as biomarkers, namely: N-acetyl-beta-glucosaminidase (NAGase) in the epidermis (moulting) and the hepatopancreas; cholinesterases (ChE) in muscle (neuromuscular cholinergic transmission); NADP(+)-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) and lactate dehydrogenease (LDH) in muscle (energy production); glutathione S-transferases (GST) in hepatopancreas (biotransformation and oxidative stress system); glutathione reductase (GR), and glutathione peroxidade (GPx), total glutathione levels (TG) and lipid peroxidation levels in the hepatopancreas (anti-oxidant defences and oxidative damage). Because no information on C. maenas NAGase activity was previously available, its variation during the moult cycle was also investigated. The results showed that locomotion was significantly increased at fluoxetine concentrations equal or above 120 mu g L-1, with animals spending more time moving, walking longer distances than controls. Levels of NAGase activity were found to vary in relation to C. maenas moult cycle, but no alterations were observed after exposure to fluoxetine. Significant increases in the activity of ChE, GST and GR enzymes, and the levels of TG were found, with a lowest observed effect concentration (LOEC) of 120 mu g L-1. Effects on locomotion were significantly and positively correlated to those induced on ChE activity. The results raise concern when hypothesising conditions of chronic exposure in the wild.

The novel feature of the present study is the use of insect protease. The protease was found to be compatible with some of the commercial detergents tested, and was also effective in cleaving various protein substrates tested, albeit to different extents, implying broader substrate specificity and effectiveness of the protease against a wide variety of stains, This property of the protease can also be exploited by using it as an active component in enzymic debriders in view of its ability to digest various protein substrates. The insect protease appears to be potentially useful as an additive in detergent, stain remover and other bio-formulations.																	0885-4513					APR	2000	31		2				85	89		10.1042/BA19990078							WOS:000086605300002	10744951

Krill Nyctiphanes simplex gonad affection associated with acute-intensity phyllobothriid plerocercoid infection	PARASITOLOGY RESEARCH												This is the first acute-intensity record of helminths parasitizing the subtropical krill Nyctiphanes simplex Hansen, 1911. We briefly describe the pathology of infection of Phyllobothriidae gen. sp. plerocercoids parasitizing N. simplex in the Gulf of California. Infection occurred with a very low prevalence (P = 0.06%, n = 1563 specimens), although acute-intensity exceeded several hundred plerocercoids crowding the hemocoel in one female host. Nyctiphanes simplex showed inflammatory response of hemocyte-based infiltration, nodule formation, and presumptive melanization. Remarkably, cestodes invade and supplant the gonad, causing atretic oocytes and severe tissue destruction in the gonad likely leading to castration and cell death in connective tissue of the infected organs suggesting that acute-intensity infection exceeds the krill's reaction capacity. Thus, Phyllobothriidae gen. sp. negatively affects the host by depleting its fitness, leading to total castration to prevent/block host reproduction.

The difference in signal strength (Delta S-v was used to distinguish northern krill (Meganyctiphanes norvegica) from other acoustic scatterers. The approach is concluded to be very effective, but it can be improved greatly by applying the following series of simple extensions to current protocols: first, set a very low threshold on both frequencies to minimize sampling bias; second, undertake tests to confirm that the data extracted from each acoustic frequency apply to the same scatterers, third, ensure that the range of Delta S-v is not greater than the TSrange at either frequency; and finally, when abundance estimation is the primary aim, arrange for sampling at the time of day and using the acoustic frequency that together provide the least variance.																	1054-3139					JAN	2007	64	1					39	48		10.1093/icesjms/fsl010							WOS:000246865300005

Recent studies indicate that efficacy of proteolytic enzymes can be improved by increasing the enzyme concentration and by creating a formulation that maintains a moist wound environment. Our goal was to select the optimal concentration for collagenase in a gel formulation. In ten female domestic pigs, eight experimental Full-thickness ulcers were treated once daily with different concentrations (0.1-10U/cm(2)) of collagenase in a get until all wounds were healed. The reduction of necrotic tissue and total wound size was measured daily using computerized image analysis. The results were dose-dependent over the whole concentration range. Collagenase gel in a concentration of 3.16U/cm(2) cleaned significantly better than placebo and saline (p < 0.002) and reduced the time to total wound healing by 3.3 days compared to placebo gel (p < 0.001) and by 9.6 days compared to saline (p < 0.001). These findings indicate that a gel formulation containing collagenase in concentrations of 1-10U/cm(2) is suitable for wound debridement.																	1044-7946					SEP-OCT	1999	11	5					117	124									WOS:000083064100007

We propose a method using krill sampled from the diet of predators to provide a length-frequency distribution of krill at times when it is possible to run automated shipboard acoustic systems but not to conduct scientific netting, i.e during logistic/resupply operations, This will allow a robust estimate of krill abundance to be calculated from acoustic data. Changes in the length-frequency distribution of krill over a period of a few weeks produced a 10% difference in TS, whereas simultaneous samples from predators and nets produced only a 1% difference, illustrating the need for simultaneous length-frequency data. By integrating data from land-based predators directly with automated on-board data collection systems it will be possible to gain important estimates of krill biomass at times of the season hitherto unavailable from shipboard scientific surveys.

Observations of large-scale fluid transport by laser-guided plankton aggregations	PHYSICS OF FLUIDS												Diel vertical migration of plankton has been proposed to affect global ocean circulation to a degree comparable to winds and tides. This biomixing process has never been directly observed, however, due to the inability to predict its occurrence in situ or to reproduce it in a laboratory setting. Furthermore, it has been argued that the energy imparted to the ocean by plankton migrations occurs at the scale of individual organisms, which is too small to impact ocean mixing. We describe the development of a multi-laser guidance system that leverages the phototactic abilities of plankton to achieve controllable vertical migrations concurrently with laser velocimetry of the surrounding flow. Measurements in unstratified fluid show that the hydrodynamic interactions between neighboring swimmers establish an alternate energy transfer route from the small scales of individually migrating plankton to significantly larger scales. Observations of laser-induced vertical migrations of Artemia salina reveal the appearance of a downward jet, which triggers a Kelvin-Helmholtz instability that results in the generation of eddy-like structures with characteristic length scales much larger than the organisms. The measured energy spectrum is consistent with these findings and indicates energy input at large scales, despite the small individual size of the organisms. These results motivate the study of biomixing in the presence of stratification to assess the contribution of migrating zooplankton to local and global ocean dynamics. The laser control methodology developed here enables systematic study of the relevant processes. (C) 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.

Seasonal acoustic occurrence, diel-vocalizing patterns and bioduck call-type composition of Antarctic minke whales off the west coast of South Africa and the Maud Rise, Antarctica	MARINE MAMMAL SCIENCE												Seasonal occurrence, diel-vocalizing patterns, and call-types of Antarctic minke whales are described using bio-acoustic recordings from the west coast of South Africa and the Maud Rise, Antarctica. In Antarctica, minke whale bioduck calls were detected in seven of nine months of hydrophone deployment (peaking in May and September) while downsweeps were only detected in June. Bioduck calls were sporadically detected in South African waters with peak calling in September/October, and no bioducks were detected from March through August. Bioduck call occurrence was high during daytime in Antarctica but there was no diel-vocalizing pattern in South African waters. We split bioduck B call-type into two subtypes: B1 with 13 +/- 1 pulses (Dominello & Sirovic, 2016) and B2 with 9 +/- 1 pulses (this study). Bioduck B2 was detected both in Antarctic and South African waters, with harmonics up to 2 kHz. Similar bioduck call-types were detected in Antarctic and South African waters, with bioduck A2 being the most common. Month of the year was the most important predictor of bioduck occurrence both in Antarctic and South African waters.

From the kinematic analysis, we determined that the moving thoracic exopodites were spatially segregated along two axes, which reduced the interference between the ipsilateral swimming appendages. The posterior thoracic exopodites, particularly the three posteriormost appendages, varied the orientation of their paths, thereby influencing the trajectory of the exhalent stream. The predominant trajectory of the paired exhalent streams was in a ventroposterior direction, but the exhalent streams could adopt more pronounced dorsal or ventral directions relative to those more commonly observed. The fact that only one exhalent stream emerged from each side of the animal suggested that the exopodites were propelling water in a synergistic fashion. Cannon and Manton (1927) claimed that the elliptical motion of the exopodites produced both swimming currents and feeding currents, the so-called "axial currents" that flow medially between adjacent basipodites, joining together with an anteriorly directed current between the eighth pair of endopodites in the food groove to transport food to the mouth. Although we presented fine streams of fluorescein dye to tethered animals, we never observed lateral feeding currents or food groove cur-rents. We concur with Depdolla (1923) and Attramadal (1981) that food enters the feeding basket only from the front.																	0278-0372					FEB	1992	12	1					1	10		10.2307/1548713							WOS:A1992HC68000001

By the use of an ion-selective electrode, the fluoride concentration in these samples were found to be higher than that normally occurring in any mammalian species, ranging from 4340 to 18 570 ppm. The positive correlation observed with age, along with high fluoride concentrations found in krill taken from the stomachs of these whales, indicated a probable bioaccumulation of fluoride from dietary sources. These results confirmed and extended earlier findings that bone tissue in fin whales naturally contains very high concentrations of fluoride and indicate that this baleen whale is tolerant to a significant extent of the high fluoride concentrations found in krill.																	0141-1136						1991	31	3					241	247		10.1016/0141-1136(91)90014-Y							WOS:A1991GL08900006

Rapid development and persistence of a massive Antarctic sea ice tongue	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS												1] An extraordinary sea ice tongue developed near 85 degrees E over a period of 30 days in April-May 2002. The ice tongue extended to the north more than 800 km from the surrounding ice edge and covered an area greater than 200,000 km 2. Satellite measurements of ice extent and roughness characteristics demonstrate that the tongue persisted as a distinct feature throughout the winter. Remote sensing observations between 1978 and 2004 confirm that ice tongues occur frequently at this location, although the 2002 tongue was particularly pronounced. We show that ocean currents and winds conspire to favor the development of ice tongues at this location. Mean streamlines of the southern part of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current turn sharply to the north near 85 degrees E after passing through the Princess Elisabeth Trough. The edge and northern limit of the ice tongue correspond well with the pattern of mean streamlines. Mean winds in April - May have a dominant southerly component in this location, favoring offshore advection of ice; year- to- year variability in the prominence of the tongue is largely caused by variations in the wind, with northerly ( southerly) anomalies inhibiting ( promoting) development of a sea ice tongue. Ice drift is strongly northward along the axis of the tongue, suggesting the feature is formed by advection of ice from the south rather than by in situ thermodynamic ice formation. The northward current and sea ice tongue at 85 degrees E are associated with higher biomass at all trophic levels than observed elsewhere in east Antarctica.

Our main goal was to characterize micronektonic organisms using bi-frequency acoustic data (38 and 120 kHz) by calibrating an algorithm tool that discriminates groups of scatterers in the top 300 m of the productive oceanic zone east of Kerguelen Islands (Indian sector of the Southern Ocean). The bi-frequency algorithm was calibrated from acoustic properties of mono-specific biological samples collected with trawls, thus allowing to discriminate three acoustic groups of micronekton: (i) "gas-bearing" (Delta Sv.120-38 < -1 dB), (ii) "fluid-like" (Delta S-v,S-120-38 > 2 dB), and (iii) "undetermined" scatterers (-1 < Delta S-v,S-120-38 < 2 dB). The three groups likely correspond biologically to gas-filled swimbladder fish (myctophids), crustaceans (euphausiids and hyperiid amphipods), and other marine organisms potentially present in these waters and containing either lipid-filled or no inclusion (e.g. other myctophids), respectively. The Nautical Area Scattering Coefficient (NASC) was used (echo-integration cells of 10 m long and 1 m deep) between 30 and 300 m depth as a proxy of relative biomass of acoustic targets. The distribution of NASC values showed a complex pattern according to: (i) the three acoustically defined groups, (ii) the type of structures (patch vs. layers) and (iii) the timing of the day (day/night cycle). NASC values were higher at night than during the day. A large proportion of scatterers occurred in layers while patches, that mainly encompass gas-bearing organisms, are especially observed during daytime. This method provided an essential descriptive baseline of the spatial distribution of micronekton and a relevant approach to (i) link micronektonic group to physical parameters to define their habitats, (ii) investigate trophic interactions by combining active acoustic and top predator satellite tracking, and (iii) study the functioning of the pelagic ecosystems at various spatio-temporal scales.

J	Phleger, CF; Nichols, PD; Virtue, P				Phleger, CF; Nichols, PD; Virtue, P			Lipids and trophodynamics of Antarctic zooplankton	COMPARATIVE BIOCHEMISTRY AND PHYSIOLOGY B-BIOCHEMISTRY & MOLECULAR BIOLOGY												Zooplankton were collected by trawl from the Elephant Island region of the Antarctic Peninsula and from East Antarctica near 63-65 degrees S and 139-150 degrees W. Most zooplankton had low percentages of wax esters (0-8%, as percent of total lipid). High triacylglycerol levels were found in the hyperiid amphipod Themisto gaudichaudii (68%, as percent of total lipid), the krill (Euphausiacea) Euphausia tricantha (44-54% triacylglycerol) and Euphausia frigida (27% triacylglycerol) and the scyphomedusan Periphylla periphylla (42-48% triacylglycerol). Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) comprised 23-60% of the total fatty acids, with the omega-3 fatty acids eicosapentaenoic acid [20:5(n-3)] and docosahexaenoic acid [22:6(n-3)] being most abundant. P. periphylla was an exception with 12-19% docosapentaenoic acid [22:5 (n-3)] being the major PUFA. The major euphausiid sterols included cholesterol (75-92%, as percent of total sterols) and desmosterol (6-22%). The major sterols of other zooplankton were more diverse and included trans-dehydrocholesterol, 24-methylenecholesterol, brassicasterol and 24-nordehydrocholesterol. The benthic ascidian, Distaplia cylindrica, had 45% stanols, as percent of total sterols, whereas the pelagic ascidian Salpa thompsonii had only 8-11% stanols. Lipid, fatty acid and sterol data are used to examine trophodynamic interactions and provide an ability to distinguish herbivorous and carnivorous diets and determine survival and reproductive strategies.

Hydroxyapatite chromatography (HAC), size-exclusion chromatography (SEC), and reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) were used to capture and purify calcium-binding peptides. The peptide sequence was determined to be VLGYIQIR (N-to C-terminal, MW = 960.58 Da), using LTQ Orbitrap XL. According to the results of FTIR and mass spectrometry, chelating site of calcium ions may possibly involve the carbonal or amino groups of Gln, Ile and Arg residues. Molecular dynamic simulation showed the conformation of peptide was markedly varied, and the distance between calcium ion and Gln and Ile residues was changing all the time. However, the distance between calcium ion and carboxyl oxygen of arginine residues was not changed significantly from 2 ns to 100 ns. Identified peptide can be used as a novel calcium supplement.																	0308-8146	1873-7072				MAR 15	2018	243						389	395		10.1016/j.foodchem.2017.09.152							WOS:000414961700049	29146354

In order to relate top predators to other components of the ecosystem studied simultaneously, their distribution is mainly described in terms of energy flow. Bird, seal, and probably also whale requirements were highest in ice-covered areas. There was no evidence of higher numbers of top predators along the ice edge: densities generally increased further into the ice. In the pack ice, combined energy requirements of top predators often amounted to about 200.000 kJ/day/km2, or about 45 kg fresh food, indicating high abundance and availability of prey under the ice. There was a lack of conformity between top predator abundance on the ice and abundance of other life in the water column below. In open water, bird requirements were generally less than 25.000 kJ/day/km2, seals were virtually absent and whales were distributed unevenly. Tubenosed birds concentrated along the outer ice edge in early summer but they moved north to open water during December, leaving the area of maximum phytoplankton biomass associated with the retreating ice edge. This pattern matched northward movements of krill swarms that may be related to changes in quality rather than quantity of phytoplankton stocks.																	0722-4060					APR	1992	12	1					93	102		10.1007/BF00239969							WOS:A1992HT73100011

The freeze concentration method was tested to determine if it could be used to recover water-soluble proteins while leaving the fluoride in solution. After freezing and thawing the wash water, protein and fluoride contents of the thawed fractions were determined to explore the melting regularity of components in the wash water. The highest concentration factors of protein and fluoride were obtained after 80 min of thawing, such as 1.48 +/- 0.06 and 1.35 +/- 0.04 times, respectively. The free amino-nitrogen (FAN) content and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis pattern results revealed that the highest concentrations of all ingredients were obtained after 80 min of the process. The degree of hydrolysis of all fractions from the thawing process fluctuated in a narrow range around 12% during the entire process, indicating that the thawing order did not change with various proteins or time during the entire thawing course. These results demonstrate that the freeze concentration method can be used to concentrate protein solutions, even those with fluoride. It was concluded that condensation was achieved and no ingredient could be separated, regardless of fluoride, amino acids, or different proteins in the water.																	1672-5182	1993-5021				DEC	2017	16	6					1109	1114		10.1007/s11802-017-3288-6							WOS:000414791700020						
J	McGehee, D; Jaffe, JS				McGehee, D; Jaffe, JS			Three-dimensional swimming behavior of individual zooplankters: Observations using the acoustical imaging system FishTV	ICES JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE					ICES International Symposium on Fisheries and Plankton Acoustics	JUN 12-16, 1995	MARINE LAB, ABERDEEN, SCOTLAND	Int Council Explorat Sea, Inst Acoust, Acoust Soc Amer, Soc Francaise Acoust	MARINE LAB			There is increasing recognition that three-dimensional tracks of individual zooplankters are needed for studies in biological oceanography, including, for example, the role of individual behavior in patch formation and maintenance. The three-dimensional acoustical imaging system FishTV provides a means of non-invasively examining zooplankton swimming behavior. The system forms a set of 64 acoustic beams in an 8 by 8 pattern, each beam 2 degrees by 2 degrees, for a total coverage of 16 degrees by 16 degrees. The 8 by 8 beams form two dimensions of the image; range provides the third dimension. The system has 20 kHz of bandwidth and operates at a center frequency of 445 kHz. Observations of zooplankton swimming at 37 m depth were made from the research platform RP ''FLIP'' at a site in the San Diego Trough, 28 km south-west of San Diego, California, USA. In a 1-min-long sequence of 60 images, acquired al 2101 h, 24 March 1993, 314 plankters were tracked for lengths of time ranging from 2 to 13 s. The animals ranged from -83.0 dB re l m(2) to -57.7 dB target strength. Movement of each animal was divided into directed and random components. The directed component was attributed to currents, waves and (possibly) a slight vertical migration. The random component was attributed to random behavior. Analysis of random velocities and turning behavior showed an inverse relationship between swimming speed and path curvature. Turning rates were approximately 1.2 rad s(-1) regardless of the size or speed of the animals. Mean swimming speeds were positively correlated with distance from a pair of bright lights (part of a video system), while mean path curvatures were negatively correlated. These observations are consistent with a model for swimming behavior that leads to aggregation.

Successful comparisons of distantly related species will thus yield highly important sequence elements likely to serve fundamental biological roles. RNA regulatory elements are less well understood than those in DNA. In this study we use the emerging model organism Nasonia vitripennis, a parasitic wasp, in a comparative analysis against 12 insect genomes to identify deeply conserved non-coding elements (CNEs) conserved in large groups of insects, with a focus on 5' UTRs and promoter sequences. Results: We report the identification of 322 CNEs conserved across a broad range of insect orders. The identified regions are associated with regulatory and developmental genes, and contain short footprints revealing aspects of their likely function in translational regulation. The most ancient regions identified in our analysis were all found to overlap transcribed regions of genes, reflecting stronger conservation of translational regulatory elements than transcriptional elements. Further expanding sequence analyses to non-insect species we also report the discovery of, to our knowledge, the two oldest and most ubiquitous CNE's yet described in the animal kingdom (700 MYA). These ancient conserved non-coding elements are associated with the two ribosomal stalk genes, RPLP1 and RPLP2, and were very likely functional in some of the earliest animals. Conclusions: We report the identification of themost deeply conserved CNE's found to date, and several other deeply conserved elements which are without exception, part of 5' untranslated regions of transcripts, and occur in a number of key translational regulatory genes, highlighting translational regulation of translational regulators as a conserved feature of insect genomes.

J	Zhou, M; Niiler, PP; Hu, JH				Zhou, M; Niiler, PP; Hu, JH			Surface currents in the Bransfield and Gerlache Straits, Antarctica	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART I-OCEANOGRAPHIC RESEARCH PAPERS												We used 39 tracks of mixed layer drifters deployed during the period from November 1998 to January 1990 to study the surface flow characteristics in the Bransfield and Gerlache Straits, Antarctica. The results revealed both the Gerlache Strait Current and the Bransfield Strait Current, which flows along the deep channel of the Gerlache Strait, northeastward to the southern continental margin of the South Shetland Islands following the 750 m isobath. The observed strongest sustained daily mean current reached approximately 40 cm s(-1) in the Bransfield Strait and was confined to the shelf break south of the South Shetland Islands. The computed acceleration of drifters in the Bransfield Strait Current indicates the southward transversal component limits drifters from approaching isobaths shallower than 750 m. The southern side of the Current is rich in cyclonic eddies. Drifters spun off and circulated in cyclonic eddies over deep basins. The residence time of a water parcel in the current is approximately 10-20 days. Anticyclonic circulations were observed around Tower, Hoseason and Liege Islands, and long residence times were found for drifters in shallows and bays of up to 70 days. Results also indicate the Gerlache Strait water can extend along the shelf of the Antarctic peninsula to Tower Island, where it meets the southewestward Weddell Sea water. Most of the Gerlache Strait water exits northward and enters the Bransfield Strait Current. It Spins off and mixes with other waters in the Bransfield Strait. Several long tracks indicated the existence of a cyclonic large circulation gyre in the Bransfield Strait during the ice-free condition. The circulation patterns in both Bransfield and Gerlache Straits change seasonally. The analysis of force balance indicates that currents and eddies are geostrophic though the ageostrophic components are important to maintain currents and form eddies. This composition of eddies and currents provides ideal physical settings for zooplankton growth in eddies and bays and zooplankton dispersion in currents. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

In this study, EPA and DHA chains were locked under precursor ion scan (PreIS) mode for untargeted screening PLEPA/DHA in krill oil using hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (HILIC-MS/MS). The effect of collision energy and declustering potential on the fragmentation of EPA (m/z 301.2) and DHA (m/z 327.2) chains was studied. A total of 33 PLEPA/DHA were characterized (sn-1/sn-2) and quantified using regression models, including 16 PLEPA/DHA , 11 PLEPA/DHA , and 6 PLEPA/DHA. Afterward, this method was validated in terms of linearity (>= 0.9978), sensitivity (LOD <= 4.02 mu g.L-1), precision (RSDintraday <= 4.71%), and recovery (>78.9%). Finally, the performance of HILIC-PreIS-MS/MS was compared with those of conventional methods, and the results indicated its superiority in selective screening PLEPA/DHA in krill oil.

ANALYSIS OF VARIABILITY OF KRILL SIZE AND FISH BY-CATCH IN THE JAPANESE KRILL FISHERY BASED ON SCIENTIFIC OBSERVER DATA	CCAMLR SCIENCE												To estimate the optimal relative sample size of scientific observer data collected on Antarctic krill commercial fishing vessels, the relationship between statistical precision and sample size was estimated by using variance component analysis. Observer datasets from the Japanese krill fishery from 1995 to 2008 were analysed using a hierarchical Bayesian model. The models were composed of multistage cluster units (i.e. year, subarea, vessel, cruise and haul) based on a state-space model, separating biological process error in the population dynamics from fishery process as observation error. In both krill length and by-catch fish number, the parameters estimated by the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method hardly show difference among years, subareas and vessels. The potent interaction effect between year and subarea suggests large spatio-temporal variability in the size structure of the krill population, which is presumably derived from large variability of recruitment causing difficulty in predicting krill population dynamics. Variances of observer datasets were calculated by the multistage sampling formula with the variance terms derived from the Bayesian model. For both krill length and by-catch fish number, vessel sample size shows marked effects on the coefficient of variation (CV), although haul sample size affects CV for only krill length data up to 10% haul coverage. These results suggest that data collection by scientific observers on board commercial vessels provides important information for the management of krill resources and the Antarctic ecosystem, while further discussion is needed about the optimal relative sample size to ensure the statistical precision required for the specific objective of a study that includes consideration of the cost of observer deployment.																	1023-4063						2012	19						31	47									WOS:000318781400003

The enzyme, optimally active at pH 8.0 towards p-tosyl-L-arginine methyl ester and unstable at acid pH, was high in acidic amino acid residues. Under some conditions the enzyme readily autodigested.

Computational molecular dynamics simulations between ECAK and Cr3+ were conducted to elucidate the functional role of Cr3+ on ECAK structure and catalysis. As a result, the binding mechanism of Cr3+ to ECAK along with binding sites and structural changes were predicted. To confirm the simulation results, kinetic studies of Cr3+-mediated aggregation of ECAK were subsequently conducted. We found that Cr3+ significantly induced ECAK aggregation with a multi-phase kinetic process at a high dose of Cr3+. The spectrofluorimetric results showed that Cr3+-induced tertiary structural changes in ECAK caused extensive exposure of hydrophobic surfaces, which could be a triggering factor for inducing ECAK aggregation. Our study provides new information concerning the effect of Cr3+ on ECAK's enzymatic function and unfolding, including aggregation, which might be toxic or act as a negative regulator.

J	GONZALEZ, HE				GONZALEZ, HE			THE DISTRIBUTION AND ABUNDANCE OF KRILL FECAL MATERIAL AND OVAL PELLETS IN THE SCOTIA AND WEDDELL SEAS (ANTARCTICA) AND THEIR ROLE IN PARTICLE-FLUX	POLAR BIOLOGY												The abundance and depth distribution of zooplankton faeces in spring to early summer were investigated along meridional transects (47-degrees-W and 49-degrees-W) that extended from the Scotia Sea (57-degrees-S) across the Weddell-Scotia Confluence and into the Weddell Gyre (62-degrees-S). The sea ice edge retreated from 59-degrees-30'S to 61-degrees-S during the study. Faeces were sampled with nets, Niskin bottles and sediment traps and subsequently analysed by light and electron (SEM) microscopy. Krill faecal strings and oval faecal pellets of unknown origin were by far the most important zooplankton faeces and highest concentrations were always found in the Confluence often close to the ice border. Krill faeces were usually more abundant in the uppermost layer (0-50 m) where they contributed an average of 130-mu-g dry weight m-3. There was an exponential decrease with depth, with a minimum of 0.6-mu-g dry weight m-3 in the 500-1000 m stratum. Oval pellets were more evenly distributed in the upper 1000 m of the water column, with an average of 9-mu-g dry weight m-3, although there was a small peak (20-mu-g dry weight m-3) in the subsurface layer (50-150 m depth). Consecutive collections (day-night) of krill faeces using drifting sediment traps showed that only the larger strings sank from 50 to 150 m depth. Peritrophic membranes appeared to deteriorate during sinking. Diatoms (in particular Nitzschia and Thalassiosira spp.) contributed by far the bulk of material in krill and oval faeces. In samples collected near or under the pack ice, remains of crustaceans in both krill- and oval faeces were also found.

Free Fatty Acids in Commercial Krill Oils: Concentrations, Compositions, and Implications for Oxidative Stability	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN OIL CHEMISTS SOCIETY												The concentrations and pro-oxidative effects of free fatty acids in commercial krill oil are not well defined. We now report that krill oil free fatty acids account for 2-13% of total lipids in commercial krill oil (n = 8) that these compounds are enriched in eicosapentaenoic acid (+7.1%) and docosahexaenoic acid (+6.3%) relative to whole oils; and that this composition make them highly pro-oxidizing in marine triacylglycerol oils, but not in krill oil, which derives oxidative stability from both its phospholipids, and neutral lipids (the latter because of astaxanthin). Specific fatty acid esterification patterns showed that krill oil free fatty acids predominantly (88-93%) originated from phospholipids, mainly from the sn-2 position, which was eight-fold more hydrolyzed than the sn-1 position. Lipolysis was not ongoing in stored oils. Adding small amounts of krill oil (1-5%) to marine triacylglycerol oils significantly increased their oxidative stability and also their resistance to free fatty acid-mediated pro-oxidative effects.

The analysis was based on sightings data obtained from the 1989/90 and 1982/83 IWC/IDCR cruises. The mean sea-surface temperatures for comparable areas were significantly higher in 1989/90 (2.04 degrees C) than in 1982/83 (1.12 degrees C), and the area where the sea-surface temperature was greater than 1 degrees C in the 1989/90 study was approximately twice that of the 1982/83 study. Additionally, during the surveys, the extent of the sea ice in 1989/90 was less than that in 1982/83, with the mean ice edge about 92.6 km (50 nautical miles; 1 nautical mile approximate to 1.852 km) farther south in 1989/90 than in 1982/83. This is consistent with the sea ice extent observed in winter, when the sea ice extent was less in 1989 than in 1982. The distribution of minke whales was substantially different between the two surveys, with the density and abundance of minke whales being greater in 1982/83 than in 1989/90. The warmer sea-surface temperatures, fewer cold-water intrusions, and the smaller extent of sea ice in 1989/90 may be related to the difference in distribution of minke whales from 1982/83, possibly owing to the shift in availability of prey.																	1054-6006					SEP	2000	9	3					214	223		10.1046/j.1365-2419.2000.00137.x							WOS:000089400500002						
J	Serrano, AE				Serrano, Augusto E., Jr.			Ontogenetic Changes in the Activity of Chymotrypsin and Carboxypeptidases A and B in Mud Crab, Scylla serrata	ISRAELI JOURNAL OF AQUACULTURE-BAMIDGEH												The ontogenetic pattern of an endopeptidase (chymotrypsin) and two exopeptidases (carboxypeptidases A and B) in larvae of the mud crab, Scylla serrata, are described. Specific activity of chymotrypsin was detected in all larvae stages. The activity was about 25% of the maximum at stage Z1, doubled at Z2 and Z3, declined to 40% at Z4 and Z5, abruptly increased to maximum activity during the megalopa stage, and fell to about 33% at the first crab stage, CI. Carboxypeptidase A activity was low at Z1, gradually increased from 4% to 13%, 19%, and 27% of the maximum at Z5, markedly increased to 68% at the megalopa stage, and finally peaked at CI. Carboxypeptidase B activity started at 9%, declined to 4%, abruptly increased to almost 50% at Z3, remained high at Z4, Z5, and the megalopa stage (50%, 61%, and 50% of the maximum), and finally peaked at CI. The overall changes could be related to changes in diet and feeding habits, or to behavioral, mechanical, and physiological changes, or their combination during development of S. serrata larvae.																	0792-156X						2013	65								897								WOS:000319614900001						
J	Reid, K; Watkins, JL; Croxall, JP; Murphy, EJ				Reid, K; Watkins, JL; Croxall, JP; Murphy, EJ			Krill population dynamics at South Georgia 1991-1997, based on data from predators and nets	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												Central to understanding krill population dynamics is knowledge of their population structure. To examine this we used length-frequency distributions from 142 wk of sampling (n = 23996 krill) of 3 predator species breeding at South Georgia and 12 wk of sampling (n = 10252 krill) from scientific nets from the same area over the summers of 1991-1997. In comparing the 5 years for which both predator and net samples were available, despite differing selectivities and spatio-temporal circumscriptions, both predators and nets were sampling the same overall krill population. Greatest similarity resulted from comparing net samples with samples from Antarctic fur seals and macaroni penguins combined; least temporal variation occurred in predator samples from late summer (March). From the 7 yr predator time series, within-year variation was greatest in 1991 and 1994, both years of low krill biomass at South Georgia. In both of these years large krill dominated during December but were completely replaced by small krill by February. The mean length of the March krill population showed a regular increase from 1991 to 1993, fell to a minimum in 1994 and thereafter increased steadily to 1997. Using these data in conjunction with putative size/age-group cohorts in the length-frequency distribution. we suggest that years of high mean krill length reflect failure of small krill to recruit into the population, producing a period of low krill biomass in the following year. Similar recruitment failure in the same years was evident in krill populations in the Antarctic Peninsula region to the south, indicating large-scale events. This supports suggestions of periodic fluctuations in krill production and recruitment which may relate directly to physical phenomena such as cycles in the distribution and extent of sea ice.																	0171-8630						1999	177						103	114		10.3354/meps177103							WOS:000079215300010						
J	JOIRIS, CR				JOIRIS, CR			SPRING DISTRIBUTION AND ECOLOGICAL ROLE OF SEABIRDS AND MARINE MAMMALS IN THE WEDDELL SEA, ANTARCTICA	POLAR BIOLOGY												The early spring distribution of seabirds, pinnipeds and cetaceans was quantitatively determined in the northern Weddell Sea during the EPOS 1 cruise of the icebreaking R V Polarstern. Two hundred and ninety-one half hour counts were made in the Antarctic region between October 18 and November 16, 1988 (+ 94 counts in sub-antarctic and sub-tropical water). The bird populations were dominated by the Adelie Penguin Pygoscelis adeliae, which represented 90% of the birds counted in the closed pack ice (CPI), with a mean density of 31 penguins per km2. Crabeater seal Lobodon carcinophagus, the most common pinniped, had a mean density of 1.2/km2 in the CPI with local concentrations reaching 14/km2. Expressed as biomass, mean values of about 90 kg/km2 were found in the whole Antarctic zone for seabirds, 50 for seals, and 35 for baleen cetaceans. Densities were higher in the CPI: 140, 180 and 115 kg/km2 respectively, were found for birds, pinnipeds and baleen whales, and lowest in open water (8 kg/km2 for the birds, 0.2 for the pinnipeds and no whales). A minimum value of food intake by seabirds and marine mammals was estimated to be 2.7 mg C/m2/day for the Antarctic zone (4.1 in the CPI). Taking into account that pinnipeds density and cetacean food uptake are underestimated, and that Antarctic seabirds consume much more fish than generally suspected, a minimum krill production of 16 mg C/m2/day is proposed for the Antarctic zone: 22.5 in the CPI, 3 in open water, and intermediate values in the marginal ice zones.																	0722-4060					DEC	1991	11	7					415	424									WOS:A1991GU47800001						
J	Siegel, V				Siegel, V.			The Antarctic krill: resource and climate indicator, 35 years of German krill research	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ICHTHYOLOGY												P>In 1975/76, Germany resurrected its scientific interest in Antarctic marine biological research after it had ceased at the end of the 1930s. The first field campaign was carried out on board FRV 'Walther Herwig' (II) by the Federal Research Board of Fisheries in Hamburg in cooperation with the Institute of Marine Research at Kiel University. At that time the main objective was the search for freely accessible, and hardly exploited marine living resources. A commercial krill fishery had just started in the Antarctic, but was developing rapidly. Therefore, very soon it became necessary to integrate this research in international programmes. The multinational BIOMASS programme (Biological Investigations on Marine Antarctic Systems and Stocks) was founded in 1980. Its central focus was nothing less than to accomplish a first population census for krill in the South Atlantic.																	0175-8659					APR	2010	26			1			41	46		10.1111/j.1439-0426.2010.01445.x							WOS:000275761600008

Determination of the nutritional value, protein quality and safety of krill protein concentrate isolated using an isoelectric solubilization/precipitation technique	FOOD CHEMISTRY												Despite its abundance, krill is not utilized for human consumption due to the lack of proper technology for protein recovery. The objectives of this study were to isolate krill protein concentrate (KPC) and to determine the nutritional value, health benefits, and safety of KPC for human consumption. Proximate analysis of protein recovered by isoelectric solubilzation/precipitation indicated that KPC was composed of approximately 78% protein and 8% fat (dry weight). In vivo analysis of protein quality indicated that protein digestibility corrected for amino acid score and protein efficiency ratio was equal to casein. KPC safety was indicated by the absence of differences in clinical measures of kidney function compared to casein. Fatty acid analysis of KPC showed that approximately 27% were omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (omega-3 PUFAs). Based on our study, KPC appears to be a promising protein source for human consumption with the advantage of being a rich source of w-3 PUFAs. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Wu, ZQ; Jiang, GL				Wu, Zhiqiang; Jiang, Guoliang			Purification and characterization of trypsin-like enzymes from Neomysis japonica using BApNA as substrate	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PEPTIDE RESEARCH AND THERAPEUTICS												Using N-alpha-benzoyl-L-arginine p-nitroanilide (BApNA) as substrate, trypsin-like enzymes (TLEs) were purified from mysis (Neomysis japonica) following two chromatographic steps, Sephacryl S100 HR gel filtration and Benzamidine-Sepharose 4B affinity. They presented a high stability in the raw material, retaining over 45% of the initial activity after 30 days of storage at pH 8.0, 45 degrees C. The purified TLEs had relative molecular mass between 32 kDa and 33 kDa. With higher stability and greater activity, they had similar stability and activity profiles (pH 6.0-11.0, 15-65 degrees C) as bovine trypsin but had a different optimum temperature (35 degrees C for trypsin and 45 degrees C for TLEs). Similar to bovine trypsin, the purified TLEs could be activated by Ca2+ and Mg2+. And the purified TLEs also showed similar inhibitory profiles as bovine trypsin with the exception of chicken egg ovomucoid (CEOM), an effective inhibitor of bovine trypsin but less so for purified TLEs. Having TLEs with physiological efficiency 3.6 times that of bovine trypsin, the use of mysis as a source for commercial production of TLEs is discussed.																	1573-3149	1573-3904				JUN	2008	14	2					75	80		10.1007/s10989-007-9102-3							WOS:000255878700001

The optimal pH and temperature for enzyme activity were 8.0 and 45 degrees C, respectively. Purified lipase had K-m and V-max values of 3.27 mmol L-1 and 2.4 Umg(-1), respectively, using p-nitrophenyl laurate as the substrate. Li-pase activity was enhanced by adding Ca2+ and Mg2+ ions in the concentration ranges of 0-0.5 mmol L-1 and 0-0.3mmol L-1, respectively, while the activity was inhibited by a further increase in these ion concentrations. Fe3+ and Cu2+ ions showed obvious inhibitory effects on enzyme activity, and the inhibition rates were 71.8% and 53.3% when the ion concentrations were 0.5 mmol L-1.																	1671-2463	1993-5021				FEB	2020	19	1					209	215		10.1007/s11802-020-4174-1							WOS:000511965100021						
J	Temperoni, B; Massa, A; Vinas, MD				Temperoni, Brenda; Massa, Agueda; Delia Vinas, Maria			Fatty acids composition as an indicator of food intake in Merluccius hubbsi larvae	JOURNAL OF THE MARINE BIOLOGICAL ASSOCIATION OF THE UNITED KINGDOM												Fatty acids (FA) analysis is a well-established approach for qualitatively studying feeding preferences. In the Argentinean Continental Shelf, Argentine hake Merluccius hubbsi supports the major demersal finfish fishery. The Patagonian stock of the species spawns and nurses in austral summer in the north Patagonian shelf (NPS, 43 degrees-45 degrees 30 ' S). Previous studies about larval feeding in the NPS have solely focused on gut contents, indicating selectivity upon calanoid copepods. Hence, our main objective was to apply the FA approach to confirm and/or broaden M. hubbsi larval food selection. Hake larvae and copepod FA profiles overlapped significantly, dominated by the saturated FA 16:0, the monounsaturated FAs 18:1n-9 and 22:1n-9, and the polyunsaturated FA 22:6n-3. Moreover, identified markers typical of bacteria (15:0, 17:0) and dinoflagellates (18:4n-3, 22:6n-3) suggest a microbial input at the base of the NPS food web, with the latter probably acting as an intermediate step between bacteria and hake larvae. Possible direct predation upon protozoans by larvae is postulated, broadening the known trophic spectrum derived from classical diet analyses. The FA approach allowed us to clarify feeding preferences in the NPS, with data being relevant in the context of hake recruitment studies.																	0025-3154	1469-7769				JUN	2019	99	4					983	990		10.1017/S002531541800070X							WOS:000474835600030						
J	Petersen, S; Anger, K				Petersen, S; Anger, K			Chemical and physiological changes during the embryonic development of the spider crab, Hyas araneus L (Decapoda:Majidae)	COMPARATIVE BIOCHEMISTRY AND PHYSIOLOGY B-BIOCHEMISTRY & MOLECULAR BIOLOGY												During embryogenesis of the spider crab, Hyas araneus, four developmental phases were distinguished microscopically: cleavage, gastrula,;embryo differentiation, prehatching phase. Changes in fresh weight (FW), dry weight (DW), ash-free dry weight (AFDW), water, carbon (C), nitrogen (N), total lipids, proteins, carbohydrates, and respiration rates were measured in developing eggs. The percentage of water increased from 52% to 87% of FW, most rapidly after the beginning of organ differentiation and during hatching. The accumulation of minerals followed a similar pattern, with ash increasing from 3% to 7% of DW in the eggs, and to 26% at hatching. Inverse (decreasing) patterns were observed in organic matter (AFDW, C, N, lipids, proteins). During development from the undivided egg to the freshly hatched zoea larva, 69% of the initial lipid and 35% of protein were depleted. Carbohydrates represented a minor constituent of yolk (1% to 2% of DW). In spite of a decreasing protein content, N remained almost constant. This suggests a final increase in low-molecular nitrogenous substances, which are not quantitatively detected by the Lowry method (probably free amino acids); we suspect that these may play a role in the hatching process. In the gastrula, and from about 3 months after the onset of organ differentiation until 1 or 2 months before hatching, low embryonic respiration rates as well as microscopical observations indicated the existence of developmental resting periods. Such diapause-like intervals may coordinate the time of hatching with a short season of planktonic food production in high latitudes. The relative importance of lipids and proteins as fuel for embryogenesis is compared with that in other crustacean taxa.

J	Benoit-Bird, KJ; Gilly, WF				Benoit-Bird, Kelly J.; Gilly, William F.			Coordinated nocturnal behavior of foraging jumbo squid Dosidicus gigas	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												We used split-beam acoustic techniques to observe free-swimming of jumbo squid Dosidicus gigas during 4 cruises in the Gulf of California. Four-dimensional spatio-temporal data revealed that at night in shallow water, jumbo squid were using ascending, spiral-like swimming paths to emerge from extremely dense aggregations, and were likely foraging on potential prey that were found overlapping in depth with their tracks. Within small regions at the vertices of these swimming paths, individual squid swam back and forth repetitively before continuing their ascent. The behaviors observed in these high-use regions, described using density kernel statistics, are consistent with other observations of prey capture behavior by squid. Often, the observed swimming paths of individual squid were found to parallel those of other squid in depth over time. In addition to being coordinated in depth, movements of individuals within a group of up to 40 individuals were coordinated in horizontal space so that high-use areas were overlapping in horizontal space but separated vertically. The resulting groups of tracks look like interwoven multiple helices anchored at their vertices by bouts of presumed feeding. These highly polarized, complex, coordinated movement patterns constitute schooling. Polarization in these groups did not break down during apparent feeding events as has been observed in other species. In fact, the feeding events themselves may define the anchor for group behavior. Schooling of jumbo squid school will likely be critical in understanding many aspects of their biology.																	0171-8630	1616-1599					2012	455						211	228		10.3354/meps09664							WOS:000304607100014

Autonomous Gliders Reveal Features of the Water Column Associated with Foraging by Adelie Penguins	INTEGRATIVE AND COMPARATIVE BIOLOGY					Annual Meeting of the Society-for-Integrative-and-Comparative-Biology	JAN 03-07, 2010	Seattle, WA	Soc Integrat & Comparat Biol				Despite their strong dependence on the pelagic environment, seabirds and other top predators in polar marine ecosystems are generally studied during their reproductive phases in terrestrial environments. As a result, a significant portion of their life history is understudied which in turn has led to limited understanding. Recent advances in autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) technologies have allowed satellite-tagged Adelie penguins to guide AUV surveys of the marine environment at the Palmer Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) site on the western Antarctic Peninsula. Near real-time data sent via Iridium satellites from the AUVs to a centralized control center thousands of miles away allowed scientists to adapt AUV sampling strategies to meet the changing conditions of the subsurface. Such AUV data revealed the water masses and fine-scale features associated with Adelie penguin foraging trips. During this study, the maximum concentration of chlorophyll was between 30 and 50 m deep. Encompassing this peak in the chlorophyll concentration, within the water-column, was a mixture of nutrient-laden Upper Circumpolar Deep (UCDW) and western Antarctic Peninsula winter water (WW). Together, data from the AUV survey and penguin dives reveal that 54% of foraging by Adelie penguins occurs immediately below the chlorophyll maximum. These data demonstrate how bringing together emerging technologies, such as AUVs, with established methods such as the radio-tagging of penguins can provide powerful tools for monitoring and hypothesis testing of previously inaccessible ecological processes. Ocean and atmosphere temperatures are expected to continue increasing along the western Antarctic Peninsula, which will undoubtedly affect regional marine ecosystems. New and emerging technologies such as unmanned underwater vehicles and individually mounted satellite tracking devices will provide the tools critical to documenting and understanding the widespread ecological change expected in polar regions.				schofield, oscar/H-4169-2018	schofield, oscar/0000-0003-2359-4131												1540-7063	1557-7023				DEC	2010	50	6					1041	1050		10.1093/icb/icq098							WOS:000284430400012	21558258

Flies of the genus Anatalanta live mainly in seabird colonies from the littoral level to 700 m a.s.l. Two species are known: A. aptera Eaten and A. crozetensis Enderlein. Several morphological forms from 2 islands have been surveyed and 21 enzyme systems, involving 30 common putative enzyme loci, were scored from reared individuals. Mean heterozygosity values vary from 0.053 to 0.169. Genetic differentiation is weak with low Nei's distances. Noticeable gaps between morphological and genetic data are emphasized and question the real taxonomic status of the two recognized species. It is now necessary to compare populations of the genus Anatalanta from its whole distributional range (Iles Crozet, Iles Kerguelen and Heard Island). An improved understanding of the historical processes by which these islands were colonized could result from these studies.

Most data were collected on the two most abundant species, Bryde's whale (B. edeni), ca. 13,000 kg and fin whale (B. physalus), ca. 47,000 kg. Bryde's whales fed primarily on schooling fish and were most abundant in summer and autumn when schooling fish are concentrated in the study area. Fin whales were only observed feeding on euphausiids, and were most abundant in winter and spring when euphausiids are abundant throughout the Gulf of California. Bryde's whales fed more at dawn and dusk, whereas fin whales fed throughout the day. Bryde's whales were relatively resident to the study area, rarely traveled in groups, and frequently fed alone or in small aggregations. Fin whales, in contrast, were relatively transient, passing through the study area and lingering only to feed; they traveled in larger groups and fed in larger aggregations, within which there were coordinated groups of two to four individuals. These results, coupled with limited data on the blue whale (B. musculus), ca. 80,000 kg, and minke whale (B. acutorostrata), ca. 5,000 kg, are interpreted in light of theories that relate body size to diet, habitat use, and social behavior in better-studied terrestrial mammals.																	0022-2372	1545-1542				AUG	1992	73	3					477	486		10.2307/1382013							WOS:A1992JK33600002						
J	Gorokhova, E				Gorokhova, E			Moult cycle and its chronology in Mysis mixta and Neomysis integer (Crustacea, Mysidacea): implications for growth assessment	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY												The moult-staging technique was used to determine the main moult stages (MS) and their duration in laboratory-reared juveniles and subadults of Mysis mixta and Neomysis integer. The relative duration of each stage was similar for both species with premoult occupying the major part of the moult cycle (51% and 44% for M. mixta and N. integer, respectively), followed by postmoult (26% and 34%) and intermoult (23% and 22%). Effects of temperature and feeding regimes on the chronology of the moult cycle were investigated. When the duration of the moult cycle (MCD) was extended by manipulating the feeding regime, animals prolonged their late postmoult and early premoult stages. At 12 and 5 degreesC, no specific moult stage varied in relative duration as long as food supply was high. Field application of moult staging for growth assessment was tested using wild-caught M mixta. The MCD estimated via moulting experiments was compared to that obtained by analyzing moult stage distribution combined with the experimentally obtained data on stage duration. Close correspondence between two methods of MCD assessment was observed with moultstaging technique being particularly useful in situations when conducting of experiments immediately after collection is not feasible.

Euphausiids had the highest overall fluoride concentrations of a range of Antarctic marine crustaceans examined; levels of up to 5477 mu g g(-1) were found in the exoskeleton of Euphausia crystallorophias. Copepods had the lowest fluoride levels (0.87 mu g g(-1) whole-body); some amphipods and mysids also exhibited relatively high fluoride levels. There was no apparent relationship between the lifestyle of the crustaceans and their fluoride level, benthic and pelagic species exhibited both high and low fluoride levels. Fluoride was concentrated in the exoskeleton, but not evenly distributed through it; the exoskeleton of the head, carapace and abdomen contained the highest concentrations of fluoride, followed by the feeding basket and pleopods, and the eyes. The mouthparts of E. superba contained almost 13 000 mu g F g(-1) dry wt. Antarctic krill tail muscle had low levels of fluoride. After long-term (1 to 5 yr) storage in formalin, fluoride was almost completely lost from whole euphausiids.

An energy-distance trade-off in a central-place forager, the Antarctic fur seal (Arctocephalus gazella)	MARINE BIOLOGY												We tested the prediction that lactating fur seals (Arctocephalus gazella) at South Georgia will take prey of greater energy density with increasing distance of foraging from the colony. The study investigated the differences in diet of fur seals foraging within two regions, one near the breeding colony and the other at greater distance. Diet varied significantly in relation to foraging location. Dietary items of low quality were eaten in both regions but more food items with a high-energy content appeared in the diet of seals travelling to distant oceanic waters. We conclude that there is likely to be a trade-off between energy gain and distance travelled which enables female fur seals to maintain a relatively constant rate of energy delivery to their offspring irrespective of the distance travelled to find food.

EXTRACTION AND CHARACTERIZATION OF PHISICOCHEMICAL, MORPHOLOGICAL, AND STRUCTURAL PROPERTIES OF CHITIN AND CHITOSAN FROM Brachystola magna (Girard)	REVISTA MEXICANA DE INGENIERIA QUIMICA												Chitin was isolated from the insect Brachystola magna using au acid-alkali treatment (1 M of HCl and NaOH) at high temperature (97 degrees C); it was then deacetylated to chitosan (NaOH 40 % /110 degrees C/ 5.5 h). The dry weight yields of chitin and chitosan were 10.4 and 8.1% respectively. Chitin and chitosan were characterized by inflated spectroscopy with Fourier transform, X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, potentiomeiric titration and high-performance size-exclusion chromatography; they were compared with commercial chitin and chitosan. The results showed that the obtained chitin and chitosan had chemical structures comparable to commercial polymers, with similar physicochemical properties; the obtained chitosan had a deacetylation degree of 87 % and high molecular weight (25.8 kDa). Brachystola magna Girard could be considered as a potential source for obtaining chitin and chitnsan in significant quantities and at low cost.

Each 24 h (for 72 h) numbers of saprophytic (Colony Forming Units, CFU), chitinolytic, and total bacteria (Acridine Orange Direct Count, AODC), were determined in the stomachs and hepatopancreata of animals. Parallely, the activities of chitinase, N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase (NAGase), protease, cellulase and laminarinase were measured, and bacterial and endogenous chitinases compared by Fast Protein Liquid Chromatography (FPLC). CFU in ''C'' group stomachs were stable, but varied widely in the ''A'' group. AODC did not vary to any great extent. Hepatopancreas CFU decreased by four orders in the ''A'' compared to the ''C'' group. In ''C'' hepatopancreata, AODC were slighly higher than in ''A''. Numbers of chitinolytic bacteria fell steeply in the ''A'' group. Chitinase, NAGase, protease, and cellulase activities in the stomach were significantly lower (5% level) after 24 h in ''A'' than in ''C''. Laminarinase activity was significantly reduced in both organs after 72 h. Hepatopancreas chitinase and protease activities showed significant reductions only after 24 h. FPLC elution profiles of NAGase from krill, and bacteria grown on a medium semi-selective for chitinolytic bacteria differed. A number of bacterial chitinase peaks were absent in the ''A'' group. The API Zym system showed reduced proteolytic and lipase (C14) activity over 72 h. Endogenous bacteria are considered commensal with respect to the enzymes discussed.

Eighty seven percentage of the krill examined (n = 93) were infected with the parasites in the cephalin stage, which were regularly found in the hind-gut epithelium of their host. Cephalins were found attached to the epithelium, and then were liberated into the intestinal lumen. The gamont stage, which follows the cephalin stage, was found in the intestinal lumen, as well as the diverticulum of mid-gut gland. However, gamonts found in the mid-gut gland were considerably larger and elongated in comparison with those in the intestinal lumen. Gamonts in the diverticulum appear to damage microvilli, which are involved in the uptake of digested nutrients and secretion of various enzymes. Therefore, elevated infestation of this parasite in the mid-gut gland may have a significant impact on the nutritional state of the Antarctic krill host.

Foraminifers dominate (75%) the sea-ice community in terms of numerical abundance while turbellarians dominate (45%) in terms of biomass. Distribution of organisms is patchy and varies considerably between cruises but also between sampling sites within one cruise. The bulk of the meio-fauna is concentrated in the lowest parts of the sea ice, especially during winter and autumn. However, in porous summer sea ice, sympagic organisms also occur in high densities in upper and intermediate layers of sea ice. Proto- and metazoans associated with Antarctic sea ice include organisms actually living in sea ice, as well as those on the underside of floes and in the underlying water. The sea-ice habitat serves as a feeding ground, as well as an important nursery for juveniles, providing energy-rich food resources. The ice also constitutes a shelter from predators.

The isoenzyme pattern of N-acetyl-beta-glucosaminidase in the epidermis of the fiddler crab, Uca pugilator, is different from that in the hepatopancreas. Two isoforms of N-acetyl-beta-glucosaminidase, with molecular weights of 89 and 45.6 kDa, are present in the hepatopancreas while there is only one form of N-acetyl-beta-glucosaminidase, 89 kDa, in the epidermis. No sexual dimorphism was found in these patterns of N-acetyl-beta-glucosaminidase isoenzymes. The characteristic isoenzyme patterns in the epidermis and hepatopancreas occurred consistently throughout the molting cycle. Injections of the molting hormone, 20-hydroxyecdysone, at 25 mu g/g live weight, into crabs in premolt substage D-1, significantly increased N-acetyl-beta-glucosaminidase activity in the epidermis by 86%. Since only one form of N-acetyl-beta-glucosaminidase: 89 kDa, is present in the epidermis, the elevation in epidermal enzymatic activity after 20-hydroxyecdysone administration is entirely accounted for by this N-acetyl-beta-glucosaminidase isoenzyme. The results reported herein are the first direct evidence that in a crustacean N-acetyl-beta-glucosaminidase activity is regulated by the steroid molting hormone. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Inc.

Subcritical water hydrolysis efficiency from raw and de-oiled krill was examined over the temperature range of 200 to 280 degrees C, ratio of material to water for hydrolysis was 1:50 g/ml and for water sample contact equilibration times of 5 min to decrease the decomposition of amino acids. Nitrogen and air were used as atmosphere at pressure estimated to be between 0.101 and 6.41 MPa. The hydrolysis efficiencies of glycine, arginine, and leucine were found to be increased with increasing water temperature, consistent with higher solubility at higher temperatures. The highest yield of amino acids in de-oiled krill hydrolysate was at 280 degrees C. While, the highest amino acid yield in raw krill hydrolysate was at low temperature 200 degrees C. Also, reducing sugar content was analyzed in both samples and the results showed that the yield of reducing sugar in deoiled krill hydrolysate was higher than that of raw krill hydrolysate.

The range of the dB identification window for krill length was between 28 mm and 67 mm and the distribution of swimming orientation N[11.0 degrees, 4.0 degrees] was estimated to be between 0.06-10.97 dB, while the range estimated using N[53.1 degrees, 21.4 degrees], i.e., the distribution of orientation obtained under the brightest illuminance level, was 5.21-9.82 dB. The range of the dB window calculated using N[45.2 degrees, 23.0 degrees], obtained under the second brightest illuminance level, was 3.83-11.76 dB, and the range calculated with N[48.1 degrees, 23.0 degrees], obtained under the third illuminance level, was 3.83-11.76 dB. The range of the dB window calculated by N[45.9 degrees, 23.0 degrees] was 3.41-11.75 dB, and the range of the dB window for krill length ranging from 28 mm to 67 mm was 4.05-11.34 dB. In all the swimming orientations, the smaller the krill size was the lower the averaged target strength value was; likewise, the larger the krill size was the higher the averaged target strength value was. The result indicated that swimming orientation impacted greatly on the range of frequency differences of Antarctic krill.																	1738-5261	2005-7172				SEP	2020	55	3					391	403		10.1007/s12601-020-0031-9		SEP 2020					WOS:000566310300004

The aim of this paper is to fill this gap on one of the dominant species Pyrosoma atlanticum. Lipid content is tightly coupled to size and weight. Lipid composition shows a large dominance of structural polar lipids. Neutral lipids were dominated by sterols with low levels of acylglycerols and free fatty acids. Phospholipids show a dominance of PC with intermediate percentages of PE and DPG. Other constituents (PS, PI, LPC, sphingolipids) were present at lower levels. Fatty acid composition of DAG and TAG showed a dominance of saturated acids (16:0, 14:0), DHA and intermediate levels of MUFA. Phospholipids were dominated by DHA with values exceeding 30% of total FA in all categories except for PI, where lower percentages occurred. Saturated acids were second in abundance with MUFA showing intermediate concentrations. Sterols were dominated by 24-methylcholesta-5,22E-dien-3 beta-ol with more than 22% of the total sterol. Cholesterol (cholest-5-en-3 beta-ol) represented only 12 % of the total while 24-methylcholesta-5,24(28)E-dien-3 beta-ol accounted for 11% of the total sterols. The low levels of triacylglycerols and free fatty acids, coupled with high concentrations of glycolipids and phytoplankton-derived degraded chloropigments, is evidence of a direct link with the digestive activity and substantiate the idea of a high physiological turnover as an alternative to large lipid accumulation. The fatty acid and sterol profiles are consistent with a diverse phytoplankton diet, and a strong contribution of phospholipid classes to energy needs, including locomotion.

J	DEMER, DA; MARTIN, LV				DEMER, DA; MARTIN, LV			ZOOPLANKTON TARGET STRENGTH - VOLUMETRIC OR AREAL DEPENDENCE	JOURNAL OF THE ACOUSTICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA												Target strengths (TS) of various zooplankton were measured at 200 kHz, 420 kHz, and 1 MHz and the dependence of these data on animal volume versus cross-sectional area was explored. The 420-kHz and 1-MHz data were collected with a dual-beam sonar system and the 200-kHz data with a split-beam system. Experiments were conducted with live, tethered individuals in an enclosure filled with filtered seawater. The data were compared to both empirical and theoretical models of reduced target strength (TS normalized by the square of the animal length) versus ka (the product of wave number and equivalent cylindrical radius). The theoretical models chosen for this comparison were two versions of a high-pass bent-cylinder model (Stanton, 1989b) that indicate TS is dependent on animal volume, and the ray bent-cylinder model (Stanton, 1993a) which implies TS is dependent on the cross-sectional area. The dependence of acoustic backscattering on animal volume or area was tested by fitting regression lines for TS versus the logs of ka, length (L), wet weight (WW), and dry weight (DW). Contrary to an empirical model derived from similar experiments (Wiebe et al., 1990), and to the high-pass models, the regressions indicated that TS is proportional to the cross-sectional area of the animal. However, because scattering from individual zooplankton is highly nonlinear, especially in the geometric scattering region (ka>1), linear regressions of TS versus the log of ka, L, WW, or DW can be misleading. Furthermore, neither Wiebe er al. (1990) nor this experiment directly accounted for animal orientations. Simulations using a distorted-wave Born-approximation model (Chu et al., 1993), indicated that animal behavior is an important factor in the scattering characteristics of zooplankton. Different distributions of animal tilt angle can influence the general trend of the TS model to exhibit either areal or near volumetric dependence.

The winter pack-ice zone provides a sheltered but food-poor habitat for larval Antarctic krill	NATURE ECOLOGY & EVOLUTION												A dominant Antarctic ecological paradigm suggests that winter sea ice is generally the main feeding ground for krill larvae. Observations from our winter cruise to the southwest Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean contradict this view and present the first evidence that the pack-ice zone is a food-poor habitat for larval development. In contrast, the more open marginal ice zone provides a more favourable food environment for high larval krill growth rates. We found that complex under-ice habitats are, however, vital for larval krill when water column productivity is limited by light, by providing structures that offer protection from predators and to collect organic material released from the ice. The larvae feed on this sparse ice-associated food during the day. After sunset, they migrate into the water below the ice (upper 20 m) and drift away from the ice areas where they have previously fed. Model analyses indicate that this behaviour increases both food uptake in a patchy food environment and the likelihood of overwinter transport to areas where feeding conditions are more favourable in spring.

J	Zou, E; Fingerman, M				Zou, E; Fingerman, M			Chitobiase activity in the epidermis and hepatopancreas of the fiddler crab Uca pugilator during the molting cycle	MARINE BIOLOGY												The activity of chitobiase, also known as N-acetyl-beta-glucosaminidase, in the epidermis and hepatopancreas of the fiddler crab Uca pugilator (Bosc, 1802), during the molting cycle, was investigated. A pH optimum of 5 to 6 was found for the enzymatic activity in both the epidermis and hepatopancreas. The temperature optimum for epidermal and hepatopancreatic chitobiase activities was 50 to 60 degrees C. The K(m) values for epidermal and hepatopancreatic chitobiase activities at 19 degrees C were 0.190 +/- 0.027 and 0.203 +/- 0.016 mM 4-methylumbelliferyl-N-acetyl-beta-glucosaminide respectively. Hepatopancreatic chitobiase activity was significantly higher than epidermal enzymatic activity in all the molt cycle stages tested except Postmolt Stage A-B. Chitobiase activity Varied significantly during the molting cycle, with the epidermal enzymatic activity in Premolt Stage D(3-4) significantly higher than in Stage C (intermolt) and Premolt Stage D(0), whereas hepatopancreatic chitobiase activity in Premolt Stage D(3-4) Was significantly higher than in all other molt stages tested. The patterns of chitobiase activity in the epidermis and hepatopancreas correlate well with the hemolymph titer of ecdysteroids in U. pugilator during the molting cycle; this suggests that chitobiase activity in both tissues is regulated at least in part by the steroid molting hormones.																	0025-3162					JAN	1999	133	1					97	101		10.1007/s002270050447							WOS:000078634000012						
J	LUND, ED; SIDELL, BD				LUND, ED; SIDELL, BD			NEUTRAL LIPID COMPOSITIONS OF ANTARCTIC FISH-TISSUES MAY REFLECT USE OF FATTY ACYL SUBSTRATES BY CATABOLIC SYSTEMS	MARINE BIOLOGY												Antarctic fishes contain large quantities of lipid in adipose tissue, blood and oxidative muscle. In this study, the fatty acyl compositions of free fatty acids (FFA) and triacylglycerol (TAG) in serum, adipose tissue and oxidative muscle were determined in two species of Antarctic fishes, Trematomus newnesi Boulenger, 1902, and Notothenia gibberifrons Lonnberg, 1905, collected off the Antarctic Peninsula in February and March 1987. Total lipid contents of serum and oxidative muscle in each species also were measured. T. newnesi, a mesopelagic species, has significantly more lipid in the serum than N. gibberifrons, a demersal species (17.6 +/- 2.4 and 10.4 +/- 1.0 mg lipid g-1 serum, respectively). The oxidative muscle of T. newnesi also contains more lipid than does that of N. gibberifrons (12.5 and 9.3% by dry weight, respectively). Fatty acids comprising greater than 5% of one or more of the lipid pools assayed in both species include 14:0, 16:0, 16:1, 16:2, 18:0, 18:1, 20:5 and 22:6. The percentages of 16:1 were lower (p < 0.05) in oxidative muscle FFA than in all other assayed lipid pools in both species, suggesting a catabolic preference tor some monoenes in oxidative muscle of these fishes. The percentage of 14:0 was two- to three-fold higher in adipose tissue TAG than in all other lipid pools in both species.

(2) The mean duration of foraging trips was 121 h and 100 h in 1988-89 and 1989-90, respectively, while periods ashore were 55 h and 45 h, respectively in the two years. There was a significant difference between these variables in the two years but there was no significant difference in the percentage of time spent at sea. In both years, there was significant variation between individuals in the foraging-attendance time budget. (3) There was a positive correlation between mean time spent ashore and mean time spent at sea for individual seals. The foraging-attendance patterns of seals changed significantly with time through lactation in one year of the study but not in the other. There was no effect of maternal age or size on foraging-attendance time budget. Duration of foraging trips or the period spent ashore had no effect on pup growth rate. (4) During short foraging trips (1-2 d) seals dived for a greater proportion of the time available for foraging than during longer foraging trips (> 3 d). Seals fed predominantly on krill during both years. Most foraging occurred at night and this was reflected in diel variation in times of arrival and departure of seals from the pupping colony. Based on estimated swimming speed and travel times to and from Bird Island, it was estimated that seals were normally feeding between 60 and 90 km from Bird Island.																	0021-8790					JUN	1991	60	2					577	592		10.2307/5299							WOS:A1991FT29200015						
J	Froneman, PW				Froneman, PW			Feeding ecology of the mysid, Mesopodopsis wooldridgei, in a temperate estuary along the eastern seaboard of South Africa	JOURNAL OF PLANKTON RESEARCH												Feeding ecology of the mysid, Mesopodopsis wooldridgei, was investigated at six stations in the Kariega estuary during summer (November) 1999 using in vitro incubations and the gut fluorescent technique. Three functional feeding groups were examined, adults (> 15 mm), immatures (6-8 mm) and juveniles (<4 mm). Individual levels of gut p ment concentration for adults and immatures ranged from 0.8 to 1.4 ng pigment per individual (ind.(-1)) and between 0.3 and 1.2 ng pigment ind.(-1), respectively. Among the juveniles, gut pigment concentrations ranged from 0.1 to 0.3 ng pigment ind.(-1). Gut evacuation rates for adults and immatures were 0.90 and 0.98 h(-1) respectively. Juvenile gut evacuation rates were equivalent to 1.38 h(-1). Losses of pigment during digestion were 53, 67 and 78% for adults, immatures and juveniles. Carbon derived from the consumption of phytoplankton for adults, immatures and juveniles ranged from. 1.06 to 1.77, from 1.40 to 3.39 and from. 0.19 to 0.56 mug C ind.(-1) day(-1). Clearance rates of the three Size classes feeding on microzooplankton were on average 29, 12 and 6 ml ind.(-1) h(-1) for adults, immatures and juveniles. These rates correspond to an ingestion rate of between 0.7 and 1.66 mug C ind.(-1) day(-1) for adults and between 0.21 and 0.63 mug C ind.(-1) day(-1) for immatures. Total carbon ingested by juveniles feeding on microzooplankton corresponded to between 0.12 and 0.31 mug C ind.(-1) day(-4). Carbon derived from the consumption of copepod nauplii and copepodids were equivalent to between 0.8 and 3.5 mug C ind.(-1) day(-1) for adults and between 0.4 and 1.05 mug C ind.(-1) day(-1) for immatures. Juveniles did not feed on copepod nauplii. Results of the investigation suggest that the diet of M. wooldridgei in the Kariega. estuary changes with development. This is probably due to the inability of larger individuals to feed on the small phytoplankton cells (< 10 mum) which dominate total chlorophyll a in the estuary.

J	Quillfeldt, P				Quillfeldt, P			Seasonal and annual variation in the diet of breeding and non-breeding Wilson's storm-petrels on King George Island, South Shetland Islands	POLAR BIOLOGY												The diet of breeding and non-breeding Wilson's storm-petrels (Oceanites oceanicus) was analysed over four breeding seasons on King George Island, South Shetland Islands, in order to test if there are changes in diet composition within and between seasons. Krill was the most important food item, followed by myctophid fish and amphipods. Breeding birds showed a clear seasonal pattern of diet, with krill decreasing and alternative prey increasing from the incubation to the chick-rearing period. Non-breeders were not found to change their diet composition. The data suggest that Wilson's storm-petrels selectively choose alternative prey to krill in order to meet the nutrient demands of their chicks. In years of low food availability, Wilson's storm-petrels may have a limited option of prey choice.

In addition, a statistically significant anticorrelation between air temperatures and sea-ice extent, as determined from satellite passive-microwave data during the past two decades, has been observed for this region. Consistent with this strong coupling, sea-ice extent in the WAP area has trended down during this period of satellite observations. Further, much of the variability in both air temperature and sea ice in the WAP region has been shown to be influenced by contrasting maritime (warm, moist) and continental (cold, dry) climate regimes. As part of the Palmer Long Term Ecological Research program, the ecological influence of these trends and variability is being studied, and effects have already been demonstrated at all trophic levels. Here we extend earlier observations to include the past decade and focus on the annual cycles of air temperature and sea-ice extent for the past few years, with the aim of placing these recent observations within the context of changes seen in the longer-term records. The more recent years have seen an increasing maritime influence in the WAP region, with corresponding effects on the marine ecosystem.

Herein, monodisperse microsphere-based immobilized metal affinity chromatographic material (MM-IMAC) was synthesized with Ti4+ incorporated to enrich phospholipids from krill by coordination with phosphate group. The extract was profiled by hydrophilic interaction chromatography-mass spectrometry (HILIC-MS) with 154 phospholipid molecular species detected. The parameters were loading solvent n-hexane/isopmpanol (2:8, v/v), flow rate 0.8 mL.min(-1), and eluting volume 1 mL. Besides, eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic acids structured phospholipids were located, such as phosphatidylcholine (PC) 20:5/22:6, phosphatidylinositol (PI) 18:0/20:5, etc. Finally, this method was validated in linearity (R-2 >= 0.9953), sensitivity (LOD <= 0.53 mu g.mL(-1) and LOQ <= 1.66 mu g.mL(-1)), precision (RSDintraday <= 4.86% and RSDinterday <= 6.25%), and recovery (58-83%). It indicated that the MM-Ti4+-IMAC-HILIC-MS was reliable and efficient in specific study of phospholipids in food matrix.

J	Robison, BH				Robison, BH			What drives the diel vertical migrations of Antarctic midwater fish?	JOURNAL OF THE MARINE BIOLOGICAL ASSOCIATION OF THE UNITED KINGDOM												Like their counterparts at lower latitudes, many Antarctic midwater fish make extensive, diel vertical migrations. However, Antarctic species make these migrations in the absence of two of the three selective advantages generally ascribed to this behaviour. Because the water column is nearly isothermal, there is no metabolic bonus to be gained from thermal differences in habitat depth. Likewise, because their prey do not perform significant vertical migrations, the fish migrations act to diminish rather than enhance their feeding opportunities. For Antarctic midwater fish, the sole advantage of these migrations appears to be the avoidance of visually-cued predators in the upper part of the water column. An evaluation of the relative importance of the three selective factors supports the suggestion that predator avoidance may also be the principal driver of diel vertical migrations for midwater fish at lower latitudes.																	0025-3154					JUN	2003	83	3					639	642		10.1017/S0025315403007586h							WOS:000182915100030

The low molecular weight chitosans (LMWC) had a molecular weight in the range 20,000-5000 Da. Circular dichroism spectra showed a decrease in the segment of acetylated glucosamine units, whereas X-ray diffraction and CP-MAS C-13 NMR indicated higher crystallinity and polymorphism in LMWC. The latter on thermal drying resulted in structural alterations, and yielded an insoluble product. FT-IR and X-ray diffraction showed no evidence of either Schiff's base linkage or any annealed polymorph. CP-MAS C-13 NMR showed marked changes in the chain conformations of LMWC, which are believed to be responsible for its loss of solubility and functionality. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS												Overwintering of larvae underneath Antarctic pack ice is a critical stage in the life cycle of Antarctic krill. However, there are no circumpolar assessments of available habitat for larval krill, making it difficult to evaluate how climate change may impact this life stage. We use outputs from a circumpolar sea ice model, together with a set of simple assumptions regarding key habitat features, to identify possible regions of larval krill habitat around Antarctica during winter. We assume that the location and suitability of habitat is determined by both food availability and three-dimensional complexity of the sea ice. A comparison of the combined area of these regions under current conditions with a warm climate scenario indicates that while total areal sea ice extent decreases, there is a consistently larger area of potential larval krill habitat under warm conditions. These findings suggest that decreases in sea ice extent may not necessarily be detrimental for krill populations.

These experiments revealed high but variable release rates of dissolved material (carbon and nutrients), supplying, on average, 150 mmol dissolved organic carbon (DOC) m(-2) d(-1), which is comparable with that supported by phytoplankton. Krill support, on average, 73% of the combined krill + phytoplankton production of DOC in the ecosystem, implying the importance of krill in conditioning the productivity of the Southern Ocean. However, the contribution of krill as a source of DOC varied greatly because of the patchy distribution of both krill and primary producers in the region, ranging from 98% to 10% of the combined (krill + phytoplankton) DOC release rates. These results suggest that rapid decline in krill standing stocks associated with reduced ice cover may have major consequences for microbial communities in the ecosystem, since bacterial carbon demand often exceeds the DOC supplied by phytoplankton in coastal areas of the Southern Ocean, with potential unforeseen consequences in the carbon balance of the Southern Ocean.

There are sensory structures for which there is no experimental evidence of function, there are behavioral performances for which there are no demonstrated sense organs, and there are behaviors for which there are no adaptive explanations. Scyphomedusae are diploblastic animals with a primitive level of neurological complexity, yet they exhibit a wide range of complex and sophisticated behaviors, such as sun compass navigation and daily horizontal migrations. This paper reviews the sensory ecology of orientation and migratory behavior in scyphomedusae, with an emphasis on data from Aurelia aurita.

Both species are typically boreal and subarctic, and were found in very low abundances in the Arctic water masses in the northern Barents Sea. High abundances (up to 100 to 200 ind. m(-2)) of T, inermis and T. longicaudata were found in the slope and adjoining deep waters south and south east of the Svalbard Bank. The main spawning times of T. inermis and T. longicaudata occurred in May-June and coincided with the spring phytoplankton bloom. T, inermis has a life span of 3 to 4 yr, while T. longicaudata can live up to 2 yr. Growth took place from late winter to autumn; a marked negative growth occurred during the late autumn and winter periods. The seasonally oscillating von Bertalanffy growth function gave a reasonably good fit to the growth curves. Coinciding with a strong reduction in the older capelin stock between 1984 and 1987, there was a subsequent increase in the abundance and biomass of T. inermis and T. longicaudata. A decrease in krill abundance and biomass was observed to correspond with the rapid recovery and growth of capelin stock up to 1991. This indicates a clear predator-prey interrelationship between planktivorous capelin and krill in the Barents Sea and suggests that the krill populations are to a large extent controlled by predation.																	0171-8630					DEC	1996	144	1-3					175	183		10.3354/meps144175							WOS:A1996WB52100015

Scattering patterns are shown to demonstrate orientation dependence of krill TS. Length-to-wavelength ratio (L/lambda) dependencies of reduced (normalized by square of the body length) target strength are shown for some orientation distributions. The results can explain the well-organized experimental results. The variability of the TS of krill is large when L/lambda is larger than unity, therefore, a frequency around 70 kHz is superior to 120 kHz which is ordinarily used for krill surveys.																	0919-9268					JUN	1994	60	3					261	265		10.2331/fishsci.60.261							WOS:A1994PA97800004

We studied the Cu2+-mediated inhibition and aggregation of Sepia pharaonis arginine kinase (SPAK) and found that Cu2+ markedly inhibited the SPAK activity along with mixed-type inhibition against the arginine substrate and noncompetitive inhibition against the ATP cofactor. Spectrofluorimetry results showed that Cu2+ induced a tertiary structure change in SPAK, resulting in exposure of the hydrophobic surface and increased aggregation. Cu2+-mediated SPAK aggregation followed first-order kinetics consistent with monophasic and a biphasic processes. Addition of osmolytes, including glycine and proline, effectively blocked SPAK aggregation and restored SPAK activity. Our results demonstrated the effects of Cu2+ on SPAK catalytic function, conformation, and aggregation, as well as the protective effects of osmolytes on SPAK folding. This study provided important insights into the role of Cu2+ as a negative effector of the S. pharaonis metabolic enzyme AK and the possible responses of cephalopods to unfavorable environmental conditions.

Here a new method is presented, which uses a condition index based on dry weight to predict growth increments. The method is based on a simple equation relating dry weights of shrimp and exuvia directly after moult with length measurements before and after moult. The parameter estimation of the model requires controlled moult experiments in the laboratory. In total 272 individuals moulted successfully within the first 2 days after capture, hence the increments reflected the feeding situation of the prior feeding period in the field. The results confirmed the validity of the method with data from two different years and demonstrated that in C. crangon the model parameters differ significantly between the two sexes. As a side product also moult intervals were estimated as a function of length and temperature. Moult increments were relatively shorter and more variable than previously found.

J	Cotte, C; Guinet, C				Cotte, Cedric; Guinet, Christophe			Historical whaling records reveal major regional retreat of Antarctic sea ice	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART I-OCEANOGRAPHIC RESEARCH PAPERS												Several studies have provided evidence of a reduction of the Antarctic sea ice extent. However, these studies were conducted either at a global scale or at a regional scale, and possible inter-regional differences were not analysed. Using the long-term whaling database we investigated circum-Antarctic changes in summer sea ice extent from 1931 to 1987. Accounting for bias inherent in the whaling method, this analysis provides new insight into the historical ice edge reconstruction and inter-regional differences. We highlight a reduction of the sea ice extent occurring in the 1960s, mainly in the Weddell sector where the change ranged from 3 degrees to 7.9 degrees latitude through summer. Although the whaling method may not be appropriate for detecting fine-scale change, these results provide evidence for a heterogeneous circumpolar change of the sea ice extent. The shift is temporally and spatially consistent with other environmental changes detected in the Weddell sector and also with a shift in the Southern Hemisphere annular mode. The large reduction of the sea ice extent has probably influenced the ecosystem of the Weddell Sea, particularly the krill biomass. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Stanton, TK; Wiebe, PH; Chu, DZ				Stanton, TK; Wiebe, PH; Chu, DZ			Differences between sound scattering by weakly scattering spheres and finite-length cylinders with applications to sound scattering by zooplankton	JOURNAL OF THE ACOUSTICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA												A modeling study was conducted to determine the conditions under which fluidlike zooplankton of the same volume but different shapes (spherical/cylindrical) have similar or dramatically different scattering properties. Models of sound scattering by weakly scattering spheres and cylinders of finite length used in this analysis were either taken from other papers or derived and herein adapted for direct comparison over a range of conditions. The models were examined in the very low- (ka much less than 1, kL much less than 1), moderately low-(ka much less than 1, kL greater than or similar to 1), and high-frequency regions (ka much greater than 1, kL much greater than 1), where ii is the acoustic wave number, a is the radius (spherical or cylindrical) of the body, and L is the length of the cylinders (for an elongated body with L/a = 10, "moderately low" corresponds to the range 0.1 less than or similar to ka less than or similar to 0.5). Straight and bent cylinder models were evaluated for broadside incidence, end-on incidence, and averages over various distributions of angle of orientation, The results show that for very low frequencies and for certain distributions of orientation angles at high frequencies, the averaged scattering by cylinders will be similar, if not identical, to the scattering tay spheres of the same volume. Other orientation distributions of the cylinders at high frequencies produce markedly different results. Furthermore, over a wide range of orientation distributions the scattering by spheres is dramatically different from that of the cylinders in the moderately low-frequency region and in the Rayleigh/geometric transition region: (1) the Rayleigh to geometric scattering turning point occurs at different points for the two cases when the bodies are constrained to have the same volume and (2) the functional dependence of the scattering levels upon the volume of the bodies in the moderately low-frequency region is quite often different between the spheres and cylinders because of the fact that the scattering by the cylinders is still directional in this region. The study demonstrates that then are indeed conditions under which different shaped zooplankton of the same volume will yield similar (ensemble average) scattering levels, but generally the shape and orientation distribution of the elongated bodies must be taken into account for accurate predictions.

J	Oosterhuis, SS; Baars, MA; Breteler, WCMK				Oosterhuis, SS; Baars, MA; Breteler, WCMK			Release of the enzyme chitobiase by the copepod Temora longicornis: characteristics and potential tool for estimating crustacean biomass production in the sea	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												The chitinolytic enzyme chitobiase (N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase), which is expressed during the pre-moult phase of crustaceans, is released into the ambient water after shedding of the exuvium. We examined the potential use of chitobiase activity in water samples as a measure of secondary production of crustaceans. Chitobiase activity, expressed on the substrate 4-methylumbelliferyl-N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminide (MUFNAG), was measured int experiments with the marine copepod Temora longicornis, with focus on the dissolved ('free', <0.2 mu m) fraction. Significant activity of free chitobiase was found in the ambient water of individual copepodites when they moulted to enter the next stage. The activity of the chitobiase released was linearly related to body weight and to the increment of body weight. In bacteria-poor water (filtered through 0.2 mu m), no significant decrease of free T. longicornis chitobiase occurred in the first 24 h. In non-manipulated water, the decay of free T. longicornis chitobiase by bacteria was exponential with time, with relative rates varying by 4 to 13 % h(-1) at 15 degrees C. The particle-bound chitobiase activity was related to the number of bacteria. Different sources of chitobiase could be distinguished by enzyme characteristics. The K-m value of T. longicornis chitobiase was 55 mu mol l(-1), comparable to values published for Daphnia species. In Oxyrrhis marina, a heterotrophic dinoflagellate serving as the main food item in the T. longicornis culture, enzyme assays indicated a K-m < 0.2 mu mol l(-1). Water predominantly containing bacteria showed a K-m > 100 mu mol l(-1). The usefulness of free chitobiase as a natural tracer of secondary production was tested in a culture vessel of T. longicornis. The rate of chitobiase release was derived from the chitobiase activity in the ambient culture water over time and the rate of decay in water samples devoid of copepods. From the relation between release of chitobiase and increase of body weight of moulting copepodites, the total daily biomass increase in the culture vessel was calculated. These estimates compared well with classical monitoring of biomass changes. If this relation found in T. longicornis is representative of marine crustaceans in general, tracking of free chitobiase in water samples could be a biochemical tool for estimating in situ secondary production in natural waters.																	0171-8630	1616-1599					2000	196						195	206		10.3354/meps196195							WOS:000087041900017

The effects of prey demography on humpback whale (Megaptera novaeangliae) abundance around Anvers Island, Antarctica	POLAR BIOLOGY												Baleen whales and Adelie penguins in the near-shore waters around the Antarctic Peninsula forage principally on Antarctic krill. Given the spatial overlap in the distribution of these krill predators (particularly humpback whales) and their dependence on krill, the goals of this paper are to determine if the inter-annual community structure and relative abundance of baleen whales around Anvers Island is related to krill demography and abundance, and if the potential exists for inter-specific interactions between Adelie penguins and baleen. We use whale sightings and prey data from both net tows and Adelie penguin stomach samples to correlate the abundance of humpback whales with krill demography and abundance from 1993 to 2001. We find significant relationships between whale abundance and the size-frequency distribution of krill targeted by Adelie penguins, as well as the foraging success of Adelie penguins. These findings suggest both krill predators share common prey preferences in the upper portions of the water column around Anvers Island. These findings highlight the need for better knowledge of baleen whale foraging ecology and inter-specific interactions with penguins, as sea ice and krill populations around the Antarctic Peninsula are affected by rapid changes in climate.

Our results indicated that the ethanol and n-hexane mixture (4:1, v/v) was suitable solvent for simultaneous extraction of phospholipid and nonpolar lipids. By contrast, the ethanol and n-hexane mixture (4:1, v/v) and single ethanol were suitable solvents for the extraction of polyunsaturated fatty acids-rich (36.10%-42.78% of total fatty acids for Pv and 23.57%-25.58% of total fatty acids for Pc) and phosphatidylcholine-rich (66.22-67.09 mol% of total phospholipids for Pv and 55.01-58.68 mol% of total phospholipids for Pc) oils, but acetone was suitable solvent for the extraction of astaxanthin-rich oil (436.19 mu g/g oil for Pv and 799.27 mu g/g oil for Pc). The findings will provide relevant information that can be used to improve the production of nutritional oils from shrimp by-products. Practical applications This study provides a theoretical basis for creating proper extraction processing to recover nutritional oils from shrimp by-products. For example, the ethanol and n-hexane mixture (4:1, v/v) was a suitable solvent for simultaneous extraction of phospholipid and non-polar lipids. By contrast, both of the ethanol and n-hexane mixture (4:1, v/v) and single ethanol were suitable solvents for the extraction of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA)-rich and phosphatidylcholine-rich oils, but acetone was a suitable solvent for the extraction of astaxanthin-rich oil. Therefore, the oils extracted from shrimp by-products are rich in phospholipid, PUFA, and astaxanthin, which may be used as new functional food ingredients.																	0145-8892	1745-4549				SEP	2021	45	9							e15754	10.1111/jfpp.15754		AUG 2021					WOS:000679923800001

For the muscles, PL (66.84-82.23% of total lipids) was the major component of lipids. While for the edible viscera, triacylglycerol (79.04-96.66% of total lipids) was the dominant lipid class. For all lipid samples, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) (3.47-22.02% of total FA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) (7.30-16.52% of total FA) were the predominant FAs. Among PL from the crab muscles, phosphocholine (61.51-63.27 mol%) and phosphoethanolamine (21.58-23.43 mol%) were abundant. About 250 GP molecular species belonging to six classes, including glycerophosphocholine, lysoglycerophosphocholine, glycerophosphoethanolamine, lysoglycerophosphoethanolamine, glycerophosphoserine, and lysoglycerophosphoserine, were identified in crab muscles using direct infusion mass spectrometric method. A majority of the dominant molecular species of GP contained omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid, especially EPA and DHA. The useful information obtained in this study makes it possible to use crab lipid for producing higher value-added products for commercial exploitation.																	1049-8850	1547-0636				APR 20	2020	29	4					391	406		10.1080/10498850.2020.1741753		MAR 2020					WOS:000523761600001

A euphausiid aggregation is represented by a three-dimensional probabilistic vector whose components are the mean ratios of the volume backscattering coefficients, measured at two different frequencies. The decisions on the species and the relative misclassification errors are calculated individually for each component of a vector, using classical Bayesian techniques. Classification probabilities are derived by integrating the individual decisions. The size structure of the classified aggregation is derived from a fluid-sphere model. The effectiveness of the method is demonstrated by comparing the acoustic estimates of species and sizes to net samples collected during three surveys conducted in the Ross Sea under various environmental conditions.

This was used with a Lagrangian model to investigate transport of Antarctic krill. Particle displacements from known krill spawning areas that result from surface Ekman drift, a composite large-scale now, and the combination of the two were calculated Surface Ekman drift alone only transports particles a few kilometres over the 150-day krill larval development time. The large-scale composite flow moves particles several hundreds of kilometres over the same time, suggesting this is the primary transport mechanism. An important contribution of the surface Ekman drift on particles released along the continental shelf break west of the Antarctic Peninsula is moving them north-northeast into the high-speed core of the southern Antarctic Circumpolar Current Front, which then transports the particles to South Georgia in about 140-160 days. Similar particle displacement calculations using surface now fields obtained from the Fine Resolution Antarctic Model do not show overall transport from the Antarctic Peninsula to South Georgia due to the inaccurate position of the southern Antarctic Circumpolar Current Front in the simulated circulation fields. The particle transit times obtained with the composite large-scale flow field are consistent with regional abundances of larval krill developmental stages collected in the Scotia Sea. These results strongly suggest that krill populations west of the Antarctic Peninsula provide the source for the krill populations found around South Georgia.

Krill Lecithin as Surfactant for Preparation of Oil/Water Nanoemulsions as Curcumin Carriers	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF LIPID SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												Curcumin is a component in Curcuma longa L. with documented bioactive properties but has low bioavailability. To overcome this problem, curcumin nanoemulsions are prepared employing omega-3-rich phospholipids from krill oil as a surfactant and serve as curcumin carrying systems. The phospholipids are obtained through aqueous (LAD) and ethanolic (LED) degumming processes. The data obtained shows that LAD has a recovery of 70.7 +/- 0.51% (w/w) phospholipids, being more efficient than LED with 45.97 +/- 1.27% (w/w). Also, a higher content of omega-3 fatty acids is found in LAD with 36 +/- 2.14% (w/w). From the critical micellar concentration (CMC) as an assessment of emulsifying capability, it is found that the krill oil (KO), LAD, and LED has a CMC in the range 0.666-0.700 g L-1. Two formulations with different surfactant levels are developed: experiment A with 9.5% and experiment B with 4.75% (w/w) of krill lecithin are obtained by aqueous degumming. In the formulation of nanoemulsions average particle sizes of 139 +/- 2.5 and 142 +/- 5.3 nm are produced for experiments A and B, respectively. These results indicate that krill lecithin is an omega-3 rich good surfactant which can be employed to encapsulate curcumin. Practical applications: An interest has emerged in the food industry to develop surfactants with nutritional value. Phospholipids are natural emulsifiers that are widely used to form nanoemulsions because of their elevated interfacial activity. Krill oil has been reported to be an important source of phospholipids and omega-3 fatty acids, which are mainly esterified to phospholipid moieties. Because of these properties, krill oil phospholipids could form micelles and function as carrier systems for bioactive compounds, thus increasing their permeability in the intestine. Consequently, the present work focused on obtaining a nanostructure using a natural surfactant that possesses fatty acids with nutritional value such as omega-3 fatty acids. This will provide an added value to the product obtained, as well as improve the bioavailability of non-polar bioactive compounds. The results obtained could justify the use of krill oil as a useful functional food additive.

J	Brierley, AS; Cox, MJ				Brierley, Andrew S.; Cox, Martin J.			Fewer but Not Smaller Schools in Declining Fish and Krill Populations	CURRENT BIOLOGY												Many pelagic species (species that live in the water column), including herring and krill, aggregate to form schools, shoals, or swarms (hereafter simply "schools,'' although the words are not synonyms). Schools provide benefits to individual members, including locomotory economy [1] and protection from predators that prey on individuals [2], but paradoxically make schooling species energetically viable and commercially attractive targets for predators of groups [3] and for fishers. Large schools are easier to find and yield greater prey/catch than small schools, and there is a requirement from fields as diverse as theoretical ecology and fisheries management to understand whether and how aggregation sizes change with changing population size. We collated data from vertical echosounder surveys of taxonomically diverse pelagic stocks from geographically diverse ecosystems [4-6]. The data contain common significant positive linear stock-biomass to school-number relationships. They show that the numbers of schools in the stocks change with changing stock biomass and suggest that the distributions of school sizes do not change with stock biomass. New data that we collected using a multibeam sonar [7], which can image entire schools, contained the same stock-biomass to school-number relationship and confirm that the distribution of school sizes is not related to changing stock size: put simply, as stocks decline, individuals are distributed among fewer schools, not smaller schools. Since school characteristics affect catchability (the ease or difficulty with which fishers can capture target species) [8] and availability of prey to predators [3], our findings have commercial and ecological implications, particularly within the aspirational framework of ecosystem-based management of marine systems [9, 10].

Growth trends with sex, length, season, and region	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												Growth trends of Antarctic krill with sex, length, season, and region as independent variables were modelled with a linear mixed model (LMM) using 10 yr of accumulated instantaneous growth rate (IGR) measurements. A model of inter-moult period (IMP) as a function of temperature, required to convert IGR to daily growth rate, was fitted to data from published constant-tempera lure rearing studies; this model was used to predict seasonal IMP using a model of the average sea surface temperature seasonal trend for each region. Smaller krill exhibited higher growth rates and, in general, we observed a progressive decrease in IGR and daily growth with increasing size (from over 0.2 mm d(-1) down to 0.05 mm d(-1) for 20 and 50 rum krill, respectively, in December in the Indian Ocean sector of the Southern Ocean). IGR decreased from summer to autumn, with small to negative values predominating across all length classes by autumn. December was a period of rapid growth in the Indian Ocean sector of the Southern Ocean, whereas a similar peak in growth rates appeared to occur a few months earlier in the southwest Atlantic sector. Significantly lower growth rates were exhibited by females in January and February (e.g. 0.063 and 0.050 mm d(-1) for 40 mm females) compared to males (0.119 and 0.090 mm d(-1) for 40 mm males) in the Indian Ocean sector. Since these estimates were based on growth measurements of individual animals, they may reflect the occurrence of sex-differentiated growth patterns in the natural environment. Growth rate differences between sexes Suggested that growth rate estimates based on composite length frequency distributions without sex differentiation may be problematic.

Eleven line-transect surveys were conducted in late summer and autumn of 1994-96, when surface swarms of "krill", Nyctiphanes australis, were present in the study area. Twenty species of seabird were recorded. The abundance and occurrence of species varied between sitting and flying counts. The most numerous species were sooty shearwaters (Puffinus griseus), red-billed gulls (Larus novaehollandiae), black-billed gulls (L. bulleri), and black-backed gulls (L. dominicanus). Most species were recorded throughout the study area, and different species were commonly observed together. Spatial similarity matrices revealed strongest association between red- and black-billed gulls and black-backed gulls. The small (kilometre) scale distribution of seabirds varied between surveys, between transects, and between repeated runs of the same transect 1-3 h apart. Correlations between seabird abundance, salinity gradient, and krill density were weak. Counts of seabirds were highly positively skewed. This skewness, together with spatial and temporal variability in the distribution of flocks, would make abundance estimation at sea difficult.

J	KOPCZYNSKA, E				KOPCZYNSKA, E			DOMINANCE OF MICROFLAGELLATES OVER DIATOMS IN THE ANTARCTIC AREAS OF DEEP VERTICAL MIXING AND KRILL CONCENTRATIONS	JOURNAL OF PLANKTON RESEARCH												Phytoplankton data obtained during six summer Polish expeditions to the Antarctic Peninsula area, are compared with concurrently recorded data on water column stabilities and krill abundance. The results show that flagellates (1.5-20-mu-m) are numerically dominant over diatoms in the areas of deep vertical mixing and/or extensive krill concentrations. Of 102 stations dominated by flagellates, 85 (83.3%) are located in a well mixed water column (>100 m) and correspond to a mean krill density of 15-346 t Nm-2. In the same areas, estimated flagellate carbon biomass exceeds diatom carbon. On the other hand, of the 40 stations dominated by diatoms, 36 (90%) are located in areas of increased water column stability (upper mixed layer of 10-50 m) and correspond to a low mean krill biomass of 0.34-4.6 t Nm-2. Positive correlations of flagellate to diatom (F:D) cell number ratios with the depth of the upper mixed layer suggest light limitation of diatom growth and an increased sinking rate of diatoms relative to flagellates in the areas of deep vertical mixing. The relationship of the F:D ratio with krill abundance suggests that krill prefer feeding on diatoms and are less efficient in grazing particles of the size of microflagellates (<20-mu-m). Flagellates exceed diatoms in an unstable water column when the phytoplankton populations are low; both algal groups increase in numbers with growing stability. The results provide field evidence that deep vertical mixing and krill grazing create conditions for the dominance of flagellates over diatoms. Both factors acting together are likely to suppress diatom blooms in the Antarctic.																	0142-7873					AUG	1992	14	8					1031	1054		10.1093/plankt/14.8.1031							WOS:A1992JH49200002

As a result, the binding mechanism of Pb2+ to ECAK was predicted from the binding sites, and the structural change was elucidated. To confirm the simulated results, the Pb2+-mediated inhibition and aggregation of ECAK were subsequently conducted. We found that Pb2+ partially inactivated the activity of ECAK with relatively strong binding. The spectrofluorimetry results showed that Pb2+ induced tertiary structural changes of ECAK, with the substantial exposure of hydrophobic surfaces directly induced by ECAK aggregation. The ECAK aggregation process induced by Pb2+ occurred with multi-phase kinetics. The addition of osmolytes did not protect ECAK from PI? inactivation. Because AK plays an important role in the cellular energy metabolism of invertebrates, our study suggests new information about the effect of Pb2+ on ECAK's enzymatic function and unfolding, including aggregation, which may be toxic to invertebrates or may act as a negative regulator.

We investigated the effects of Cd2+ on muscle type of creatine kinase from Pelodiscus sinensis (PSCKM). Cd2+ conspicuously inactivated the activity of PSCKM (IC50 = 0.062 mM) in a first-order kinetic process and exhibited non-competitive inhibition with creatine and ATP. A conformational study showed that Cd2+ induced tertiary structure changes in PSCKM with exposure of hydrophobic surfaces. The addition of osmolytes, such as glycine and proline, partially reactivated the Cd2+-mediated inactive PSCKM. Additionally, molecular dynamics and docking simulations between PSCKM and Cd2+ were conducted to show that Cd2+ blocked the entrance of ATP to the active site, and this result is consistent with the experimental results showing Cd2+-induced inactivation of PSCKM. Our study demonstrates the effect of Cd2+ on PSCKM enzymatic function and unfolding, including the protective effects of osmolytes on PSCKM inactivation. This study provides important insights into the changes in the PSCKM metabolic enzyme of ectothermic animals in response to the environment. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The use of specific protease inhibitors resulted in the identification of at least three protease classes in the. crude extract of C. finmarchicus. Those classes were serine, metallo and aspartic proteases. The serine and metallo proteases were found to be dominant under neutral to alkaline conditions and the aspartic proteases were dominant under acidic conditions. The cysteine proteases, if at all present, did not seem to be active or present in any substantial amount. The data presented points towards controlling and preserving the protein content in fresh C. finmarchicus. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

J	Prezelin, BB; Hofmann, EE; Moline, M; Klinck, JM				Prezelin, BB; Hofmann, EE; Moline, M; Klinck, JM			Physical forcing of phytoplankton community structure and primary production in continental shelf waters of the Western Antarctic Peninsula	JOURNAL OF MARINE RESEARCH												Analyses of a multidisciplinary data set, collected in continental shelf waters of the Western Antarctic Peninsula (WAP) during austral summer of January 1993, identified a previously unrecognized forcing mechanism that sets up a physical and chemical structure that supports and assures site-specific diatom-dominated communities and enhanced biological production (Prezelin et al., 2000). This forcing is active when the southern boundary of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) flows along the shelf edge, thereby facilitating onshelf bottom intrusions of nutrient-rich Upper Circumpolar Deep Water (UCDW), which then is upwelled or mixed into the upper water column. At times or locations where UCDW is not introduced to the upper water column, diatoms no longer dominate phytoplankton assemblages over the mid- to outer WAP continental shelf. This analysis extends the area and seasons studied through similar analyses of multidisciplinary data sets collected on four additional cruises to the WAP that cover all seasons. Results show that onshelf intrusions of UCDW: (1) occur in other regions of the WAP continental shelf; (2) are episodic; (3) are forced by nonseasonal physical processes; and (4) produce areas of diatom-dominated phytoplankton assemblages and enhanced primary production. At times, multiple intrusions are observed on the WAP continental shelf, and each event may be in a different stage. Further, the occurrence of an intrusion event in one area does not necessarily imply that similar events are ongoing in other areas along the WAP shelf. The UCDW bottom intrusions originate along the outer shelf but they can extend into the inner shelf region because the deep troughs that transect the WAP shelf provide connections between the inner and outer shelf. The boundary between the intruded water and the shelf water is variable in location because of the episodic nature of the onshelf intrusions, and is moved farther inshore as an event occurs. These observations show clearly that the phytoplankton community structure on the WAP shelf is determined by physical forcing and that primary production is likely to be considerably greater than previously believed. Moreover, variability in this physical forcing, such as may occur via climate change, can potentially affect the overall biological production of the WAP continental shelf system.

J	Phleger, CF; Nelson, MM; Mooney, BD; Nichols, PD				Phleger, CF; Nelson, MM; Mooney, BD; Nichols, PD			Interannual variations in the lipids of the Antarctic pteropods Clione limacina and Clio pyramidata	COMPARATIVE BIOCHEMISTRY AND PHYSIOLOGY B-BIOCHEMISTRY & MOLECULAR BIOLOGY												Antarctic pteropods, Clione limacina (Order Gymnosomata) and Clio pyramidata (order Thecosomata), were collected near Elephant Island, South Shetland Islands, during 1997 and 1998. Total lipid was high in C. limacina (29-36 mg g(-1) wet mass) and included 46% of diacylglyceryl ether (DAGE, as % of total lipid) for both 1997 and 1998. DAGE was not detected in C. pyramidata, which had mainly polar lipid and triacylglycerol. 1-O-Alkyl glyceryl ethers (GE) derived from the DAGE consisted primarily of 15:0 and 16:0, with lower 17:0 and a17:0. The principal sterols of both pteropods included trans-dehydrocholesterol, brassicasterol, 24-methylenecholesterol, cholesterol and desmosterol. Levels of 24-methylenecholesterol and desmosterol were lower in both pteropods in 1997 compared to 1998. C. limacina had high levels of the odd-chain fatty acids 17:1(n - 8)c and 15:0 in contrast to C. pyramidata. The previously proposed source of elevated odd-chain fatty acids in C. limacina is via propionate derived from phytoplankton DMPT; another possible source may be from thraustochytrids, which are common marine microheterotrophs. C. pyramidata had twice as much PUFA as C. limacina, largely due to higher 20:5(n - 3). The PUFA 18:5(n - 3) and very long chain fatty acids (C-24, C-26 and C-28 VLC-PUFA) were only detected in 1998 pteropods. In comparison, 1996 samples of C. limacina contained lower DAGE levels, which also may reflect differences in diet and oceanographic conditions. Interannual variations in specific lipid biomarkers are discussed with respect to possible different phytoplankton food sources available in the AMLR survey area. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Inc.

Shrimp had lipid content of 4.21% (dry weight basis). Lipids mainly consisted of triacylglycerol (TAG) 28.03g/100g and sterol (ST) 24.03g/100g. Lipid content decreased during salting, drying and the first period of fermentation (p<0.05). Both TAG and ST gradually decreased, while free fatty acid (FFA) increased and became dominant in the final product (49.29%). Phospholipids including phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) 4.80g/100g and phosphatidylcholine (PC) 5.67g/100g were also found in fresh shrimp and still remained in the final product. Palmitic acid (C16:0) was the major fatty acid in shrimp (27.95%). Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) (C20:5(n-3)) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) (C22:6(n-3)) were found at high content (19.03%). When different fractions were isolated from crude lipids, varying fatty acid profiles were obtained. TAG and FFA fractions mainly consisted of saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids. Polyunsaturated fatty acids were accumulated in PE and PC fractions. Peroxide value and TBARS value increased during Kapi production, suggesting that lipid oxidation took place. Overall, lipolysis and oxidation of shrimp lipids occurred throughout the processes, thereby affecting lipid constituents. Those changes might partially contribute to the Kapi characteristics, especially flavor.

A reported decline in energy storage over almost two decades indicates that food availability for the whales may also have declined recently. To test this hypothesis, catch data from 20 survey years in the Japanese Whale Research Program in the Antarctic (JARPA) and its second phase (JARPA II) (1990/91-2009/10), which covered the longitudinal sector between 35A degrees E and 145A degrees W south of 58A degrees S, were used to investigate whether there was any annual trend in the stomach contents weight of Antarctic minke whales. A linear mixed-effects analysis showed a 31 % (95 % CI 12.6-45.3 %) decrease in the weight of stomach contents over the 20 years since 1990/1991. A similar pattern of decrease was found in both males and females, except in the case of females sampled at higher latitude in the Ross Sea. These results suggest a decrease in the availability of krill for Antarctic minke whales in the lower latitudinal range of the research area. The results are consistent with the decline in energy storage reported previously. The decrease in krill availability could be due to environmental changes or to an increase in the abundance of other krill-feeding predators. The latter appears somewhat more likely, given the recent rapid recovery of humpback whale. Furthermore, humpback whales are not found in the Ross Sea, where both Antarctic krill and ice krill (Euphausia crystallorophias) are available, and where no change in prey availability for Antarctic minke whales is indicated.

Evidence for a krill-rich diet from non-destructive analyses of penguin bone	JOURNAL OF AVIAN BIOLOGY												Diet strongly influences the chemistry of vertebrate soft and hard tissues. Bird bone and eggshell mineral preserve reliable records of prey consumption, even beyond the life of the predator, and analyses of hard tissues have usefully reconstructed avian diet. Here, we assess the feasibility of a non-destructive method for distinguishing krill-poor from krill-rich diets in penguins. Krill (Euphausiaceae) are fluoride-rich, and penguins that consume krill produce fluoride-rich bones. The chemistry of bone mineral may be elucidated using Raman spectroscopy without recourse to specialised sample preparation. Published data from the diet of six penguin species were compared to a fluoride-informative spectral band (phosphate symmetric stretch, 1-PO43) in the Raman spectra of penguin humeri. Penguins that consume abundant krill (e.g. Adelie and emperor) have 1-PO43-band positions higher than 963 cm1, whereas penguins that primarily eat teleost fish or cephalopods (e.g. Fiordland crested, Humboldt, little blue and yellow-eyed) have 1-PO43-band positions lower than 963 cm1. A krill-rich diet can therefore be determined from the Raman spectra of penguin bones. Raman spectroscopy could be a useful supplement to existing diet analysis techniques.

J	CUZINROUDY, J; LABAT, JP				CUZINROUDY, J; LABAT, JP			EARLY SUMMER DISTRIBUTION OF ANTARCTIC KRILL SEXUAL DEVELOPMENT IN THE SCOTIA-WEDDELL REGION - A MULTIVARIATE APPROACH	POLAR BIOLOGY												The sexual Development of antarctic krill was studied during the EPOS leg 2 cruise (November 1988-January 1989) in the seasonally ice covered Scotia-Weddell Confluence area. Multiple Correspondence Analysis (MCA) was used to elucidate the general trends of variation of biological (body-size, molt stage) and environmental data (geographical position, sea-ice extension, sampling time) associated with female development. In November, female krill from the ice covered area (Weddell Sea) had a juvenile ovary, while pelagic female krill from Scotia Sea were in advanced previtellogenesis, and one third of them had already spawned. The successive samples from the Confluence illustrated a rapid advance of sexual development during the whole period. Both observation of live krill maintained on board and the MCA confirmed the general trend of distribution of sexual development in relation with size structure and environmental factors. Previtellogenesis occurs in relation with the ice-edge, while vitellogenesis is performed in short cycles in the summer pelagic habitat. The degree of sexual development attained by krill samples (measured by the sexual development index, SDI) is then a good indicator of the biological activity of the krill population and of its impact on the pelagic ecosystem.																	0722-4060					APR	1992	12	1					65	74									WOS:A1992HT73100008

Late winter oceanography off the Sabrina and BANZARE coast (117-128 degrees E), East Antarctica	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY												We report on the late winter oceanography observed beneath the Antarctic sea ice offshore from the Sabrina and BANZARE coast of Wilkes Land, East Antarctica (117-128 degrees E) in September-October 2007 during the Sea Ice Physics and Ecosystem eXperiment (SIPEX). A pilot program using specifically designed 'through-ice' conductivity-temperature-depth (CTD) and acoustic Doppler current profiling (ADCP) systems was conducted to opportunistically measure water mass properties and ocean currents at major ice stations. Additional water mass properties across the survey region were collected from Ice-Argo floats deployed during the voyage north of the 3000 m isobath. The mean drift of the floats was along the slope to the west with the Antarctic Slope Current. Vertical profiles of the potential temperature reveal the deepest (similar to 350-400 m) winter mixed layer (WML) in the western sector of the survey northwest of the Dalton Iceberg Tongue polynya. The meridional structure of the Antarctic Slope Front, i.e. the monotonic shoaling of the WML across the upper continental slope, is found to be similar to the previous observations in summer. A strong bottom-intensified intrusion of modified Circumpolar Deep Water (mCDW) as warm as 0 degrees C was detected beneath the fast ice south of the continental shelf break at 118 degrees E. An mCDW intrusion of similar strength was detected near this location in the austral summer of 1996. We hypothesise that there is a persistent supply of mCDW and associated ocean heat flux to this region of the continental shelf that is capable of migrating to the grounding lines of the nearby Totten Glacier and Moscow University Ice Shelf. There was no detection of locally formed dense shelf water capable of forming Antarctic Bottom Water at the shelf break locations sampled despite the number of minor polynyas across this region. Ocean current measurements, limited to a maximum period of 24 h and 50-100 m depth by the relative scarcity of backscatter, found increased mean vertical speeds at the offshore stations (6-17 cm s(-1)) relative to the shelf break (2.3-6.4 cm s(-1)). The diurnal variation in the ADCP range reflected the diel migration of zooplankton occurring beneath the sea ice in late winter, with greater range/abundance offshore. Concurrent time series of wind, ocean current and their influence on sea ice drift from global positioning system (GPS) compass measurements were examined but the length of data acquisitions limited the applicability of this analysis.

J	Erdogan, S; Kaya, M				Erdogan, Sevil; Kaya, Murat			High similarity in physicochemical properties of chitin and chitosan from nymphs and adults of a grasshopper	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL MACROMOLECULES												This is the first study to explain the differences in the physicochemical properties of chitin and chitosan obtained from the nymphs and adults of Dociostaurus maroccanus using the same method. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis and x-ray diffraction analysis results demonstrated that the chitins from both the adults and nymphs were in the alpha-form. The chitin contents of the adults (14%) and nymphs (12%) were of the same order of magnitude. The crystalline index values of chitins from the adult and nymph grasshoppers were 71% and 74%, respectively. Thermal stabilities of the chitins and chitosans from adult and nymph grasshoppers were close to each other. Both the adult (7.2 kDa) and nymph (5.6 kDa) chitosans had low molar masses. Environmental scanning electron microscopy revealed that the surface morphologies of both chitins consisted of nanofibers and nanopores together, and they were very similar to each other. Consequently, it was determined that the physicochemical properties of the chitins and chitosans from adults and nymphs of D. maroccanus were not very different, so it can be hypothesized that the development of the chitin structure in the nymph has almost been completed and the nymph chitin has the same characteristics as the adult.

J	Ju, SJ; Secor, DH; Harvey, HR				Ju, SJ; Secor, DH; Harvey, HR			Use of extractable lipofuscin for age determination of blue crab Callinectes sapidus	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												The blue crab Callinectes sapidus is an economically and ecologically important species in many temperate estuaries, yet stock assessments have been limited to length-based methods for demographic analyses. We evaluated the potential of age pigments (lipofuscins) sequestered in neural tissue of eye-stalks and brains to estimate the age of blue crabs collected from Chesapeake Bay and Chincoteague Bay. The rate of lipofuscin accumulation was determined using crabs of known age reared in the laboratory. Age pigments were extracted from neural tissues (eye-stalk or brain), quantified, and normalized to protein content to allow comparisons across tissue types and crab sizes. Field-collected blue crabs (35 to 185 mm carapace width) contained highly variable levels of age pigments (coefficient of variation = 58%). Lipofuscin level was significantly related to carapace width, but not significantly different between gender or sampling location. In juveniles (40 to 70 mm carapace width) reared for 6 mo, the age pigments showed no significant change during the rapid summer growth period, but significantly increased during fall (after 3 mo). Lipofuscin contents in known-age reared crabs were positively related to chronological age. Modal analysis of lipofuscin for field-collected adult males provided separation of multiple modes, whereas carapace width showed only a single broad mode. These results confirm the potential use of lipofuscin for age estimation of blue crabs.

Shrimp were concentrated in two locations within the study area and they maintained this pattern of horizontal distribution for at least 7 d. Acoustic observations revealed a scale of horizontal patchiness that was obscured by the "homogenization effect" of sampling by bottom trawl and plankton net. The shrimp underwent a nocturnal vertical migration with other zooplankton to > 200 m from the bottom and a subsequent downward migration during early daylight hours. This diel migration resulted in reduced availability of shrimp to the bottom trawl at night. Timing of the migrations varied, possibly as a result of interaction with oceanographic processes.

J	Eastman, JT; Sidell, BD				Eastman, JT; Sidell, BD			Measurements of buoyancy for some Antarctic notothenioid fishes from the South Shetland Islands	POLAR BIOLOGY												Buoyancy was measured for 258 specimens representing 13 species of adult and sub-adult nototheniids, bathydraconids, and channichthyids from the South Shetland Islands. Measurements were expressed as percentage buoyancy (%B) = W-water/W(air)x10(2). There were no neutrally buoyant species and mean values for %B were 3.07-6.11%, with channichthyids at the low end and benthic nototheniids and bathydraconids at the high end. All species showed an ontogenetic decrease in %B with increasing body weight. With the exception of Champsocephalus gunnari, there was no sexual dimorphism in %B within this sample. With some exceptions, values for %B were consistent with life-history information. Sub-adult Dissostichus mawsoni were not neutrally buoyant, as are large adults. Notothenia rossii had a significantly lower %B than closely related N. coriiceps. Benthic Gobionotothen gibber frons had a lower %B than semipelagic Lepidonotothen larseni. Although they exhibit some diversification in life history, the four channichthyids in the sample were similar in %B. Neutral buoyancy is rare in notothenioids and may be confined to a single nototheniid clade.

Inter-annual sea-ice dynamics and micro-algal biomass in winter pack ice of Marguerite Bay, Antarctica	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY												The geographic remoteness, the lack of remote sensing capabilities, and the lack of appropriate environmental sensors make the detection of seasonal trends or inter-annual variations in sea-ice microbial biomass or production processes within the pack ice of the Antarctic extremely rare. The evaluation of their inter-annual variability in the context of ice dynamics and trends in regional climate has not been possible. During the late winters of 2001 (July-August) and 2002 (August-September) we assessed sea-ice dynamics, sea-ice characteristics, and biomass of sea-ice microbiota along the Western Antarctic Peninsula. These two winters were marked by large contrasts in the dates of initial ice formation (late June in 2001 and April in 2002), which resulted in differences in the physical pack-ice characteristics. Chlorophyll a (chl a) content in ice cores differed between the study years, with 2002 having 10-fold higher chl a content. The difference in ice-core chl a content is best explained by the timing of ice formation that leads to less phytoplankton scavenging from the water column and a lack of transfer of solar energy into the pack-ice ecosystem. Such a tractable atmosphere ocean-ice-biota coupling may help in evaluating underlying processes responsible for long-term trends in recruitment cycles of upper trophic levels as well as future projections on the response of the Antarctic marine ecosystems to variability in local climate.

Future Risk for Southern Ocean Ecosystem Services Under Climate Change	FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE												The Southern Ocean supports ecosystem services that are important on a global scale. Climate change and human activities (tourism, fishing, and research) will affect both the demand for, and the provision of, these services into the future. Here we synthesize recent assessments of the current status and expected future climate-driven changes in Southern Ocean ecosystems and evaluate the potential consequences of these changes for the provision of ecosystem services. We explore in detail three key services (the 'blue carbon' pathway, the Antarctic krill fishery, and Antarctic tourism), tracing the consequences of climate change from physical drivers through biological impacts to the benefits to humans. We consider potential non-climatic drivers of change, current and future demands for the services, and the main global and regional policy frameworks that could be used to manage risks to the provision of these services in a changing climate. We also develop a formal representation of the network of interactions between the suite of potential drivers and the suite of services, providing a framework to capture the complexity of this network and its embedded feedback loops. Increased consideration of the linkages and feedbacks between drivers and ecosystem services will be required to underpin robust management responses into the future.

J	Lin, N; Liu, BL; Liu, ZD; Qi, T				Lin, Na; Liu, Baolin; Liu, Zhidong; Qi, Ting			Effects of different drying methods on the structures and functional properties of phosphorylated Antarctic krill protein	JOURNAL OF FOOD SCIENCE												Antarctic krill protein (AKP) was extracted from Antarctic krill by an alkali dissolution-isoelectric precipitation method and then it was phosphorylated with sodium tripolyphosphate. The phosphorylated Antarctic krill protein (P-AKP) powder was obtained by spray-drying (SD), freeze-drying (FD), and hot-air drying (AD), and the effects of these drying methods on the structures and functional properties of proteins were investigated. The P-AKP powder dried by SD had the best sensory performance, and its particle size was much smaller than that of FD and AD. Scanning electron microscope displayed a uniform particle size of SD powder and the particles were uniformly dispersed. X-ray diffraction analysis showed a higher crystallinity of SD sample than AD and FD. Differential scanning calorimeter analysis revealed that SD sample had the best thermal stability and less protein denaturation (Delta H= 210.80 J/g), followed by FD (Delta H= 80.48 J/g) and AD (Delta H= 73.94 J/g;P< 0.05). Fourier transform infrared showed that SD sample contained more protein secondary structure. Compared with SD, the phosphorylated group-related chemical bonds in FD and AD samples were partially destroyed. SD sample had the highest protein solubility, oil absorption capacity, emulsifying, and foaming activities than FD and AD (P< 0.05). Although FD had the highest water absorption capacity, sample prepared with AD had the worst functional performance. Therefore, different drying methods used for preparation of the P-AKP can affect its physicochemical and associated functional properties, and SD could be an appropriate drying method for the industrial mass production of P-AKP powders with better functionalities. Practical Application The optimal drying method for preparing the phosphorylated Antarctic krill protein (P-AKP) powder was proved to be spray-drying (SD), because the physicochemical and functional properties were better for P-AKP dried by SD than the other drying methods. Hence, SD was recommended for the industrial mass production of P-AKP powders with better functionalities. This research can provide theoretical guidance for the further processing and utilization of P-AKP, and offer technical reference for food processing and preservation.																	0022-1147	1750-3841				NOV	2020	85	11					3690	3699		10.1111/1750-3841.15503		OCT 2020					WOS:000578949400001	33073379					
J	Verdy, A; Flierl, G				Verdy, Ariane; Flierl, Glenn			Evolution and social behavior in krill	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY												We simulate the formation of social aggregations in a turbulent fluid environment. The theoretical framework is employed to investigate the ecological consequences of spatial patchiness in the density distribution of krill, which often assemble in swarms or schools. We first describe the formation of aggregations resulting from the interplay of social forces and population dynamics, and then consider an idealized ecosystem model of zooplankton with social behavior who feed on phytoplankton; this is solved analytically for the initial growth of patches and numerically for the steady-state distributions of predator and prey biomass. Environmental variability changes the linear instability criterion for spontaneous aggregation. The second part of the paper addresses the evolution of social behavior in a population with density-dependent mating success. The model simulates the transmission of a gene controlling social behavior; natural selection determines whether the grouping or non-grouping type becomes dominant. It is found that the behavior can evolve when mixing occurs rapidly enough for resources to remain available to the clustered organisms. Turbulent advection prevents the grouping type from becoming dominant if the shear of the flow is strong enough to disrupt the patches; otherwise the aggregated zooplankton benefit from enhanced diffusion of resources by the turbulent flow.

Lutzow-Holm Bay, where the fast sea-ice remained throughout summer, were compared to those of penguins at Magnetic Island, Prydz Bay, where the fast sea-ice disappeared in early January. Parent penguins at Hukuro Cove made shallower (7.1-11.3 m) but longer (90-111 s) dives than those at Magnetic Island (22.9 m and 62 s). Dive duration correlated with dive depth at both colonies (r(2) = 0.01 similar to 0.90), but the penguins at Hukuro Cove made longer dives for a given depth. Parents at Hukuro Cove made shorter foraging trips (8.1-14.4 h) with proportionally longer walking/swimming (diving <1 m) travel time (27-40% of trip duration) and returned with smaller meals (253-293 g) than those at Magnetic Island, which foraged on average for 57.2 h, spent 2% of time walking/swimming <1 m) travel, and with meals averaging 525 g. Trip duration at both colonies correlated to the total time spent diving. Trip duration at Hukuro Covet but not at Magnetic Island, increased as walking/swimming <1 m) travel time increased. These differences in foraging behaviour between colonies probably reflected differences in sea-ice cover and the availability of foraging sites.

Visual predation in an environment devoid of cover has resulted in convergent evolution into only six modal adaptive patterns. Large, fast, visual predators roam the water, 1) alone or in 2) schools, and they eat anything of appropriate size that they see. Prey escape only by dint of 3) very small size, 4) invisibility due to tissue transparency, 5) diurnal vertical migration, or by 6) exploitation of the sea surface. The sensory ecology and physiology of zooplankton are different from that of all other animal categories in all other habitats. Epipelagic zooplankton are either extremely small animals, with small and structurally simple sense organs, or they are large, with gelatinous, transparent bodies which often lack sense organs.

The surveys were conducted during the same austral summer as the CCAMLR 2000 Survey in the Scotia Sea (Watkins et al., Deep-Sea Research, II, this issue [doi: 10.1016/j.dsr2.2004.06.010]), and the data were analyzed in a similar manner. Biomass densities were not significantly different between the surveys and averaged 49 g m(-2). Maps of krill biomass indicate three areas of consistently high density: one near the eastern end of Elephant Island, one mid-way between Elephant Island and King George Island, and one near Cape Shirreff on the north side of Livingston Island. The areas of highest krill density appeared to move closer to the shelf break as the season progressed. This apparent movement was accompanied by a change in the demographic structure of the population, with smaller krill absent and a larger proportion of sexually mature animals present in late summer.

Among colonial animals, pinnipeds and seabirds may have different provisioning strategies, due to differences in their ability to travel and store energy. We compared the foraging areas of lactating Antarctic fur seals and chinstrap penguins breeding at Seal Island, Antarctica, to investigate whether they responded differently to the distribution of their prey (Antarctic krill and myctophid fish) and spatial heterogeneity in their habitat. Dense krill concentrations occurred in the shelf region near the colony. However, only brooding penguins, which are expected to be time-minimizers because they must return frequently with whole food for their chicks, foraged mainly in this proximal shelf region. Lactating fur seals and incubating penguins, which can make longer trips to increase energy gain per trip, and so are expected to be energy-maximizers, foraged in the more distant (>20 km from the island) slope and oceanic regions. The shelf region was characterized by more abundant, but lower-energy-content immature krill, whereas the slope and oceanic regions had less abundant but higher-energy-content gravid krill, as well as high-energy-content myctophids. Furthermore, krill in the shelf region undertook diurnal vertical migration, whereas those in the slope and oceanic regions stayed near the surface throughout the day, which may enhance the capture rate for visual predators. Therefore, we suggest that the energy-maximizers foraged in distant, but potentially more profitable feeding regions, while the time-minimizers foraged in closer, but potentially less profitable regions. Thus, time and energy constraints derived from different provisioning strategies may result in sympatric colonial predator species using different foraging areas, and as a result, some central-place foragers use suboptimal foraging habitats, in terms of the quality or quantity of available prey.

J	Thorpe, SE; Heywood, KJ; Brandon, MA; Stevens, DP				Thorpe, SE; Heywood, KJ; Brandon, MA; Stevens, DP			Variability of the southern Antarctic Circumpolar Current front north of South Georgia	JOURNAL OF MARINE SYSTEMS					Meeting on Ocean Fronts held at the 2000 AGU Ocean Sciences Meeting	JAN 24-28, 2000	SAN ANTONIO, TEXAS	Amer Geophys Union, Amer Soc Limnol & Oceanog				South Georgia ( similar to 54degreesS, 37degreesW) is an island in the eastern Scotia Sea, South Atlantic that lies in the path of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC). The southern ACC front (SACCF), one of three major fronts associated with the ACC, wraps anticyclonically around South Georgia and then retroflects north of the island. This paper investigates temporal variability in the position of the SACCF north of South Georgia that is likely to have an effect on the South Georgia ecosystem by contributing to the variability in local krill abundance. A meridional hydrographic section that crossed the SACCF three times demonstrates that the SACCF is associated with a geopotential anomaly of 4.5 J kg(-1) in the eastern Scotia Sea. A high resolution (1/4degrees x 1/4degrees) map of historical geopotential anomaly shows the mean position of the SACCF retroflection north of South Georgia to be at 36degreesW, 400 km further east than in previous work. It also reveals temporal variability associated with the SACCF in the South Georgia region, A near-surface drifter provides evidence for variability in the western extent of the SACCF north of South Georgia and for the presence of eddies in the region. Output from a 3-year (1993-1995) high frequency wind forced run of the eddy-permitting Ocean Circulation and Climate Advanced Modelling project (OCCAM) model, used to investigate the frontal variability, shows two periods of anomalous westward extent of the SACCF north of South Georgia and associated eddy-shedding. The SACCF variability affects the near-surface transport of passive drifters into the region with implications for the South Georgia ecosystem., (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

Meanwhile, subcritical butane and subcritical butane-dimethyl ether extraction were used to extract KO for analysis comparison. Folch method was used to extract total lipids. When the volume ratio of ethanol to hexane is 4:6, the separation effect of ethanol layer and hexane layer is best. At this condition, the EH method yielded similar amount of lipids (up to 97. 72% of total lipids) with subcritical butane extraction method (97.60%). The recovery rate of ethanol and hexane was 83.6% and 86.86%, respectively. KO in hexane layer and extracted by the subcritical butane method are abundant in astaxanthin (910 and 940 mg/kg respectively), while KO in the ethanol layer had the highest phospholipid (PL) content (47.34%), n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) content (45.51%), and the lowest fluorine content (11.17 mu g/g), making it a potential candidate in the nutraceutical and antioxidant industry.																	2048-7177					FEB	2019	7	2					700	710		10.1002/fsn3.914							WOS:000461547100036	30847148

Growth characteristics, including intermolt period (IP), molt increment (MI) in size and mass, and tissue allocation in juvenile, male, and female shrimp, were evaluated at 2, 5, and 8A degrees C, the temperature range where this species is generally found in the Northwest Atlantic. Significant variations in growth were associated with temperature and shrimp size. IP (days) increased significantly with shrimp size and was inversely related to temperature. Size (cephalothorax length in mm) and temperature effects were best described by IP = 10((0.67 log(CL) - 0.06 T -) (1.34)). The pronounced effect of temperature on IP while MIS changed little indicated that the main influence of temperature on growth rate of P. borealis was through IP. Specific growth rate (SGR(S)) decreased rapidly with size to near zero values in females. Overall, juveniles were much more sensitive to temperature variations than adults, suggesting that temperatures encountered during the juvenile stage will largely influence the growth trajectory of the population.

Ingestion events were detected as abrupt drops in the oesophageal temperature and related to the birds' foraging behaviour. Although a high percentage of oesophageal temperature loggers were rejected, 1 complete foraging trip was recorded for all the 3 parameters from I bird while 92% and 67% of the foraging trip was recorded for 2 other birds; 12.3% of the temperature drops occurred at the surface but they were mainly small, except 61 of them probably representing snow ingestion while the birds were on land. Ah other drops were observed during dives, 88% of them during the undulatory (and occasionally the ascent) phase of dives deeper than 40 m. The mean swim speed during nonfeeding shallow and exploratory dives was relatively constant throughout the dive, around 2.1 m s(-1), whereas during feeding deep dives, swim speed during the undulatory phase was lower (1.71 m s(-1)) than during the descent and ascent and was characterised by a series of rapid accelerations and decelerations; 42.6% of these accelerations were followed by one or more ingestion events and birds swam upward in 60% of the accelerations, Such multiple data recording opens new paths for the examination of the decision-making processes in foraging penguins.

The lagged effects of environmental changes on penguin abundance are still not well defined. We divided the Ross Sea region into six areas to investigate the effects of environmental changes on penguin abundance from 1982 to 2013. Time lagged analysis of 1-6 years between penguin abundance and environmental factors were conducted in our study. We found that penguin abundance was significantly correlated with environmental factors at different lag times (p < 0.05). The relationship between penguin abundance and environmental factors might differ among regions. Generalized additive model results showed that sea surface temperature negatively affected penguin abundance in most regions of the Ross Sea. In mid-Victoria Land, the relationship between sea-ice concentration and penguin abundance was quadratic. Penguin abundance peaked when sea-ice concentration was approximately 40%. Optimal ranges of environmental factors for Adelie penguin population might exist. Our study highlighted the lagged response of penguin abundance to environmental factors to further understand the effects of climate changes on the Antarctic biosphere.																	0722-4060	1432-2056				NOV	2020	43	11					1769	1781		10.1007/s00300-020-02743-x		SEP 2020					WOS:000569276600001

Although the strategy is clear and easy to implement, identifying a suitable direction for the DE mutation strongly depends on the direction information provided beforehand. To address this, we present a neighbor-induced mutation operator that simulates the neighbor-induced movement of Antarctic krill to guide the evolution direction in a natural manner. Additionally, center dispersion is proposed to disperse the population and redistribute individual positions to escape search stagnation, inspired by the spreading out of krill around newly discovered food. Comprising the new operator and the center dispersion pattern, this paper proposes a neighbor-induced DE algorithm with dispersion pattern (NDEd). The results of the comparative experiments verify the effectiveness of the neighbor-induced mutation operator and the dispersion pattern. Further, experimental results from 28 test functions of CEC2013 demonstrate that NDEd performs better compared to the other classic DE algorithms.

J	Camargo, JA				Camargo, JA			Fluoride toxicity to aquatic organisms: a review	CHEMOSPHERE												Published data on the toxicity of fluoride (F-) to algae, aquatic plants, invertebrates and fishes are reviewed. Aquatic organisms living in soft waters may be more adversely affected by fluoride pollution than those living in hard or seawaters because the bioavailability of fluoride ions is reduced with increasing water hardness. Fluoride can either inhibit or enhance the population growth of algae, depending upon fluoride concentration, exposure time and algal species. Aquatic plants seem to be effective in removing fluoride from contaminated water under laboratory and field conditions. In aquatic animals, fluoride tends to be accumulated in the exoskeleton of invertebrates and in the bone tissue of fishes. The toxic action of fluoride resides in the fact that fluoride ions act as enzymatic poisons, inhibiting enzyme activity and, ultimately, interrupting metabolic processes such as glycolysis and synthesis of proteins. Fluoride toxicity to aquatic invertebrates and fishes increases with increasing fluoride concentration, exposure time and water temperature, and decreases with increasing intraspecific body size and water content of calcium and chloride. Freshwater invertebrates and fishes, especially net-spinning caddisfly larvae and upstream-migrating adult salmons, appear to be more sensitive to fluoride toxicity than estuarine and marine animals. Because, in soft waters with low ionic content, a fluoride concentration as low as 0.5 mg F-/l can adversely affect invertebrates and fishes, safe levels below this fluoride concentration are recommended in order to protect freshwater animals from fluoride pollution.

In this study, the effects of Cd2+ on the cuttlefish Sepia pharaonis' arginine kinase (SPAK) were investigated. SPAK was isolated from the muscles of S. pharaonis and upon further purification, showed a single bandonSDS-PAGE. Cd2+ effectively inactivated SPAK, and the double-reciprocal kinetics indicated that Cd2+ induced non-competitive inhibition of arginine and ATP. Spectrofluorometry results showed that Cd2+ induced tertiary structure changes in SPAK with the exposure of hydrophobic surfaces that directly induced SPAK aggregation. The addition of osmolytes, glycine, and proline successfully blocked SPAK aggregation and restored the conformation and activity of SPAK. Molecular dynamics simulations involving SPAK and Cd2+ showed that Cd2+ partly blocks the entrance of ATP to the active site, and this result is consistent with the experimental results showing Cd2+-induced inactivation of SPAK. These results demonstrate the effect of Cd2+ on SPAK enzymatic function and unfolding, including aggregation and the protective effects of osmolytes on SPAK folding. This study provides concrete evidence of the toxicity of Cd2+ in the context of the metabolic enzyme SPAK, and it illustrates the toxic effects of heavy metals and detoxification mechanisms in cuttlefish.																	0739-1102	1538-0254					2016	34	8					1763	1777		10.1080/07391102.2015.1091747							WOS:000381078300013	26360528

Using habitat models for chinstrap penguins Pygoscelis antarctica to advise krill fisheries management during the penguin breeding season	DIVERSITY AND DISTRIBUTIONS												Aim To predict the at-sea distribution of chinstrap penguins across the South Orkney Islands and to quantify the overlap with the Southern Ocean krill fishery. Location Methods South Orkney Islands, Antarctica. Penguins from four colonies across the South Orkney Islands were tracked using global positioning systems (GPSs) and time depth recorders (TDRs). Relationships between a variety of environmental and geometric variables and the at-sea distribution of penguins were investigated using general additive models for the three main phases of the breeding season. Subsequently, the final models were extrapolated across the South Orkney archipelago to predict the at-sea distribution of penguins from colonies where no tracking data are available. Finally, the overlap between areas used by chinstrap penguins and the krill fishery was quantified. Results Main conclusions The foraging distribution of chinstrap penguins can be predicted using two simple and static variables: the distance from the colony and the direction of travel towards the shelf-edge, while avoiding high densities of Pygoscelis penguins from other colonies. Additionally, we find that the chinstrap penguins breeding on the South Orkney Islands use areas which overlap with frequently used krill fishing areas and that this overlap is most prominent during the brood and creche phases of the breeding season. This is the first step in understanding the potential impacts of the krill fishery, for all colonies including those where no empirical tracking data are available. However, with the available data, it is not currently possible to infer an impact of the krill fisheries on penguins. With this in mind, we recommend the implementation of monitoring schemes to investigate the effects of prey depletion on predator populations and to ensure that management continues to follow a precautionary approach and is addressed at spatial and temporal scales relevant to ecosystem operation.

J	Ritz, DA				Ritz, David A.			Gut residence time in pelagic crustaceans	JOURNAL OF THE MARINE BIOLOGICAL ASSOCIATION OF THE UNITED KINGDOM												Gut residence time (GRT) is often reported to be extremely variable among crustaceans. In this study, GRT was measured in tethered mysids that were fed continuously, and appearance of the first faecal pellet was found to be quite consistent averaging 1.6 h. There was no significant difference between GRT in those mysids field singly and those accompanied by free-swimming conspecifics, even though previous studies have shown metabolic benefits in social behaviour. Gut residence time data from a range of pelagic crustaceans feeding continuously showed a clear linear relationship with size. It appears that, when feeding ceases and crustaceans are allowed to clear their guts in filtered water, GRT can be very long and variable. However, when feeding is continuous, GRT can be relatively short and cosistent.																	0025-3154					FEB	2008	88	1					65	67		10.1017/S0025315408000118							WOS:000254298600007						
J	Wallis, EJ; Macmillan, DL				Wallis, EJ; Macmillan, DL			Foregut morphology and feeding strategies in the syncarid malacostracan Anaspides tasmaniae: Correlating structure and function	JOURNAL OF CRUSTACEAN BIOLOGY												The foregut in malacostracan crustaceans is an ectodermally derived structure that shows morphological variation among taxa. Foregut morphology was studied in a syncarid, Anaspides tasmaniae, with the dual aims of describing the structure and of elucidating similarities and differences between A. tasmaniae and other malacostracans. The feeding habits of A. tasmaniae were also studied to correlate structure and function. The feeding strategy adopted by A. tasmaniae, predominantly detritivory, but preying occasionally on large food items, may be influenced by constraints of the morphology of the foregut. Scanning electron microscopy and conventional histological techniques revealed that the foregut of A. tasmaniae lacks ossicles and that internal skeletal elements are fashioned from invaginations of the external wall. These internal elements, which direct food particles and act as sieves, are densely setose. There is no evidence of calcification nor of the ossicles that characterize many decapod foreguts. The musculature is simple and acts principally to squeeze the entire foregut rather than to cause discrete movements of individual skeletal elements. The foregut of A. tasmaniae is not easily compared to the highly modified foreguts of decapods, but it shows many similarities to the foreguts of nondecapod taxa.

Effects of chronic crude oil exposure on early developmental stages of the Northern krill (Meganyctiphanes norvegica)	JOURNAL OF TOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH-PART A-CURRENT ISSUES												Rising oil and gas activities in northern high latitudes have led to an increased risk of petroleum pollution in these ecosystems. Further, seasonal high UV radiation at high latitudes may elevate photo-enhanced toxicity of petroleum pollution to marine organisms. Zooplanktons are a key ecological component of northern ecosystems; therefore, it is important to assess their sensitivity to potential pollutants of oil and gas activity. As ontogenetic development may be particularly sensitive, the aim of this study was to examine the impact of chronic exposure to oil water dispersion (OWD) on development and feeding of early life stages of the Northern krill, Meganyctiphanes norvegica. In a range of experiments, embryonic, nonfeeding, and feeding larval stages were exposed to concentrations of between 0.01 and 0.1 mg/L of oil or photo-modified oil for 19 and 21 d. No significant effects on egg respiration, hatching success, development, length and larval survival were observed from these treatments. Similarly, evolution of fatty acid composition patterns during ontogenetic development was unaffected. The results indicates a high degree of resilience of these early developmental stages to such types and concentrations of pollutants. However, feeding and motility in later calyptopis-stage larvae were significantly impaired at exposure of 0.1 mg/L oil. Data indicate that feeding larval stage of krill was more sensitive to OWD than early nonfeeding life stages. This might be attributed to the narcotic effects of oil pollutants, their direct ingestion, or accumulated adverse effects over early development.				moodley, leon/AAH-1674-2019	Moodley, Leon/0000-0002-0617-3514; Bechmann, Renee Katrin/0000-0002-7113-4386												1528-7394	1087-2620					2017	80	16-18					916	931		10.1080/15287394.2017.1352204							WOS:000416346600010	28849995

The egg development time was estimated to be 74.7-84.5 days at in situ temperature (3 degrees C), which is much longer than those reported previously on the other oncaeid copepods even if the differences in experimental temperatures are taken into account. The egg hatching success varied between 50 and 100%, with a grand mean of 88%. The newly hatched nauplii of T. canadensis were elongate ellipsoid in shape, and had many large-sized lipid droplets in their body. Possible adaptive significance of apparent longer egg development time of T canadensis is discussed in the light of their fife cycle strategy.																	0025-3154					APR	2007	87	2					479	482		10.1017/S0025315407055336							WOS:000246419200014

Histophagous ciliate Pseudocollinia brintoni and bacterial assemblage interaction with krill Nyctiphanes simplex. I. Transmission process	DISEASES OF AQUATIC ORGANISMS												Histophagous ciliates of the genus Pseudocollinia cause epizootic events that kill adult female krill (Euphausiacea), but their mode of transmission is unknown. We compared 16S rRNA sequences of bacterial strains isolated from stomachs of healthy krill Nyctiphanes simplex specimens with sequences of bacterial isolates and sequences of natural bacterial communities from the hemocoel of N. simplex specimens infected with P. brintoni to determine possible transmission pathways. All P. brintoni endoparasitic life stages and the transmission tomite stage (outside the host) were associated with bacterial assemblages. 16S rRNA sequences from isolated bacterial strains showed that Photobacterium spp. and Pseudoalteromonas spp. were dominant members of the bacterial assemblages during all life phases of P. brintoni and potential patho-bionts. They were apparently unaffected by the krill's immune system or the histophagous activity of P. brintoni. However, other bacterial strains were found only in certain P. brintoni life phases, indicating that as the infection progressed, microhabitat conditions and microbial interactions may have become unfavorable for some strains of bacteria. Trophic infection is the most parsimonious explanation for how P. brintoni infects krill. We estimated N. simplex vulnerability to P. brintoni infection during more than three-fourths of their life span, infecting mostly adult females. The ciliates have relatively high prevalence levels (albeit at <10% of sampled stations) and a short life cycle (estimated <7 d). Histophagous ciliate-krill interactions may occur in other krill species, particularly those that form dense swarms and attain high population densities that potentially enhance trophic transmission and allow completion of the Pseudocollinia spp. life cycle.

J	Hill, SL; Phillips, T; Atkinson, A				Hill, Simeon L.; Phillips, Tony; Atkinson, Angus			Potential Climate Change Effects on the Habitat of Antarctic Krill in the Weddell Quadrant of the Southern Ocean	PLOS ONE												Antarctic krill is a cold water species, an increasingly important fishery resource and a major prey item for many fish, birds and mammals in the Southern Ocean. The fishery and the summer foraging sites of many of these predators are concentrated between 0 degrees and 90 degrees W. Parts of this quadrant have experienced recent localised sea surface warming of up to 0.2 degrees C per decade, and projections suggest that further widespread warming of 0.27 degrees to 1.08 degrees C will occur by the late 21st century. We assessed the potential influence of this projected warming on Antarctic krill habitat with a statistical model that links growth to temperature and chlorophyll concentration. The results divide the quadrant into two zones: a band around the Antarctic Circumpolar Current in which habitat quality is particularly vulnerable to warming, and a southern area which is relatively insensitive. Our analysis suggests that the direct effects of warming could reduce the area of growth habitat by up to 20%. The reduction in growth habitat within the range of predators, such as Antarctic fur seals, that forage from breeding sites on South Georgia could be up to 55%, and the habitat's ability to support Antarctic krill biomass production within this range could be reduced by up to 68%. Sensitivity analysis suggests that the effects of a 50% change in summer chlorophyll concentration could be more significant than the direct effects of warming. A reduction in primary production could lead to further habitat degradation but, even if chlorophyll increased by 50%, projected warming would still cause some degradation of the habitat accessible to predators. While there is considerable uncertainty in these projections, they suggest that future climate change could have a significant negative effect on Antarctic krill growth habitat and, consequently, on Southern Ocean biodiversity and ecosystem services.

Depth-discrete samples of krill were taken with a 1 m(2) MOCNESS net at the cardinal times of day (midnight, midday, sunrise and sunset). Specimens were immediately measured and categorised for moulting and spawning status. Further samples were preserved for detailed analysis in the home laboratory. Results showed that the population concentrated in the deep (80 to 100 m) during day-time but segregated vertically during nighttime. Moulting occurred in the deep during night-time, away from the main part of the non-moulting population, which was located between 80 and 50 m. Spawning females were most evident in the up permost depth interval (30 to 5 m). Moulting at night in the deepest layers may be viewed as a mechanism to avoid cannibalism whilst in a vulnerable condition. Spawning in the warm upper layers accelerates reproductive processes and may also reduce the depth to which the eggs sink before hatching into nauplii.																	0171-8630	1616-1599					1999	190						253	262		10.3354/meps190253							WOS:000084553000019

Here, we present the first evidence that climate fluctuations affect the vertical migration of zooplankton in the Southern Ocean, based on multi-year acoustic backscatter data from one of the deep troughs in the Amundsen Sea, Antarctica. High net primary productivity (NPP) and the annual variation in seasonal ice cover make the Amundsen Sea coastal polynya an ideal site in which to examine how zooplankton behavior responds to climate fluctuations. Our observations show that the timing of the seasonal vertical migration and abundance of zooplankton in the seasonally varying sea ice is correlated with the Southern Annular Mode (SAM) and El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO). Zooplankton in this region migrate seasonally and overwinter at depth, returning to the surface in spring. During +SAM/La Nina periods, the at-depth overwintering period is shorter compared to -SAM/El Nino periods, and return to the surface layers starts earlier in the year. These differences may result from the higher sea ice cover and decreased NPP during +SAM/La Nina periods. This observation points to a new link between global climate fluctuations and the polar marine food web.

J	Grunbaum, D				Grunbaum, D			Schooling as a strategy for taxis in a noisy environment	EVOLUTIONARY ECOLOGY												Many aquatic animals face a fundamental problem during foraging and migratory movements: while their resources commonly vary at large spatial scales, they can only sample and assess their environment at relatively small, local spatial scales. Thus, they are unable to choose movement directions by directly sampling distant parts of their environment. A common strategy to overcome this problem is taxis, a behaviour in which an animal performs a biased random walk by changing direction more rapidly when local conditions are getting worse. Such an animal spends more time moving in right directions than wrong ones, and eventually gets to a favourable area. Taxis is inefficient, however, when environmental gradients are weak or overlain by 'noisy' small-scale fluctuations. In this paper, I show that schooling behaviour can improve the ability of animals performing taxis to climb gradients, even under conditions when asocial taxis would be ineffective. Schooling is a social behaviour incorporating tendencies to remain close to and align with fellow members of a group. It enhances taxis because the alignment tendency produces tight angular distributions within groups, and dampens the stochastic effects of individual sampling errors. As a result, more school members orient up gradient than in the comparable asocial case. However, overly strong schooling behaviour makes the school slow in responding to changing gradient directions. This trade-off suggests an optimal level of schooling behaviour for given spatio-temporal scales of environmental variations. Social taxis may enhance the selective value of schooling in pelagic grazers such as herrings, anchovies and Antarctic krill. Furthermore, the degree of aggregation in a population of schooling animals may affect directly the rate and direction of migration and foraging movements.																	0269-7653					JUL	1998	12	5					503	522		10.1023/A:1006574607845							WOS:000075127900001

Is the Fatty Acid Composition of Freshwater Zoobenthic Invertebrates Controlled by Phylogenetic or Trophic Factors?	LIPIDS												We studied the fatty acid (FA) content and composition of ten zoobenthic species of several taxonomic groups from different freshwater bodies. Special attention was paid to essential polyunsaturated fatty acids, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA, 20:5n-3), docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, 22:6n-3), and arachidonic acid (ARA, 20:4n-6); and the n-3/n-6 and DHA/ARA ratios, which are important for consumers of higher trophic levels, i.e., fish. The content and ratios of these FA varied significantly in the studied zoobenthic species, consequently, the invertebrates were of different nutritional quality for fish. Eulimnogammarus viridis (Crustacea) and Dendrocoelopsis sp. (Turbellaria) had the highest nutrition value for fish concerning the content of EPA and DHA and n-3/n-6 and DHA/ARA ratios. Using canonical correspondence analysis we compared the FA profiles of species of the studied taxa taking into account their feeding strategies and habitats. We gained evidence that feeding strategy is of importance to determine fatty acid profiles of zoobenthic species. However, the phylogenetic position of the zoobenthic species is also responsible and may result in a similar fatty acid composition even if species or populations inhabit different water bodies or have different feeding strategies.

J	Watkins, JL; Brierley, AS				Watkins, JL; Brierley, AS			Verification of the acoustic techniques used to identify Antarctic krill	ICES JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE												Acoustic surveys to estimate krill biomass require that the sound backscattered by krill can be identified and distinguished from all other types of backscatter. Sampling acoustic targets with nets to verify their identity have achieved this traditionally. More recently backscattered sound has been partitioned into krill or non-krill groups using differences in mean volume backscattering strength (MVBS) at two acoustic frequencies (DeltaMVBS = MVBS120 - MVBS38; where DeltaMVBS between 2 and 12 dB indicated krill). Here we compare net and acoustic data from two cruises around South Georgia in 1996 to assess the reliability of acoustic-based, target-identification techniques. MVBS data at 120 and 38 kHz were collected with a Simrad EK500 echosounder and net samples were collected with an RMT8. Around 80% of the echo integration cells from targets believed to be krill on the basis of their appearance on echo-charts, were also identified as krill from their difference in backscatter at 38 and 120 kHz. Krill biomass estimated from acoustic targets identified using echo-chart appearance or DeltaMVBS were broadly similar (regression: DeltaMVBS = 0.94 visual classification, r(2) = 0.99). Krill size was calculated from scattering models using the two frequency data and compared with that obtained in net hauls. This comparison revealed that a simplified bent-cylinder model was a better predictor of krill length than a fluid-filled, sphere model. We conclude that use of DeltaMVBS to identify Antarctic krill is advantageous because it is more objective than using echo-chart appearance.

Krill space: a comparative assessment of mesoscale structuring in polar and temperate marine ecosystems	ICES JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE												The spatial organization, mesoscale variability, and habitat associations of krill within portions of the Antarctic Peninsula and California Current marine ecosystems are compared. Using a decade of acoustic observations and remotely sensed oceanography (2000-2009), the hypothesis that mesoscale spatial organization of krill in both systems closely relates to geospatial variability of the shelf break and is non-linearly related to geostrophic flow and positively related to chlorophyll a (Chl a) is tested. Directional-dependence analysis to measure spatial variability of krill is used along with spatially explicit generalized additive models to quantify and compare the spatial relationships among krill and habitat characteristics in both systems. The results suggest the following aspects of krill spatial organization: (i) areas of dense aggregation, i. e. hot spots, are present in both systems and are orientated in the direction of the shelf break, (ii) moderate levels of eddy kinetic energy seem to concentrate krill in favourable habitats and lessen the likelihood of advection away from the system, and (iii) variable responses to surface Chl a concentration suggest that realtime Chl a values may not be useful as a global predictor of important krill habitat. The results provide valuable reference points for marine spatial management of krill and for refining ecosystem and foodweb models.																	1054-3139	1095-9289				SEP	2012	69	7					1317	1327		10.1093/icesjms/fss048							WOS:000308012000021

Antarctic krill defluoridated hydrolysate products (DHPs) generally have a bitter taste that is unacceptable to consumers. Therefore, it is necessary to improve the flavor of defluoridated hydrolysate. In this work, flavor improvement of DHPs by the Maillard reaction was evaluated by sensory analysis, electronic nose (E-nose), and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The potential correlations among the signals of sensory attributes, E-nose, and volatile components were analyzed using the analysis of partial least squares regression (PLSR). A total of 63 volatile compounds were identified and quantified via GC-MS. The flavors in Maillard reaction products were mainly attributed to pyrazines, aldehydes, ketones, and furans. After the Maillard reaction, the two main aromatic compounds generated were 3-ethyl-2,5-dimethylpyrazin (roast odor, OAV = 32.7) and 3-(methylthio) propionaldehyde (shrimp meat odor, OAV = 16.43), which contributed to flavor improvement in DHPs. PLSR results showed a good correlation between most variables of sensory attributes, E-nose, and volatile compounds, which indicates that the overall flavor of DHPs was improved by the Maillard reaction.																	1049-8850	1547-0636				MAR 15	2020	29	3					279	292		10.1080/10498850.2020.1723764		FEB 2020					WOS:000513415500001

The objective of this study was to explore spatio-temporal distribution patterns of Antarctic blue whales in the Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean, using passive acoustic monitoring data. Multi-year data were collected between 2008 and 2013 by 11 recorders deployed in the Weddell Sea and along the Greenwich meridian. Antarctic blue whale Z-calls were detected via spectrogram cross-correlation. A Blue Whale Index was developed to quantify the proportion of time during which acoustic energy from Antarctic blue whales dominated over background noise. Our results show that Antarctic blue whales were acoustically present year-round, with most call detections between January and April. During austral summer, the number of detected calls peaked synchronously throughout the study area in most years, and hence, no directed meridional movement pattern was detectable. During austral winter, vocalizations were recorded at latitudes as high as 69 degrees S, with sea ice cover exceeding 90%, suggesting that some Antarctic blue whales overwinter in Antarctic waters. Polynyas likely serve as an important habitat for baleen whales during austral winter, providing food and reliable access to open water for breathing. Overall, our results support increasing evidence of a complex and non-obligatory migratory behavior of Antarctic blue whales, potentially involving temporally and spatially dynamic migration routes and destinations, as well as variable timing of migration to and from the feeding grounds.

J	Grunbaum, D; Veit, RR				Grunbaum, D; Veit, RR			Black-browed albatrosses foraging on Antarctic krill: Density-dependence through local enhancement?	ECOLOGY												Many Antarctic seabirds depend on prey that are patchy, cryptic, ephemeral, and unpredictable in location. These predators typically employ two alternative behavioral strategies for locating resource patches: direct visual or olfactory detection, and indirect detection (local enhancement) by sighting other predators that are already exploiting a patch. We developed a model of direct detection and local enhancement in seabirds that predicts how foraging success varies with behavioral strategy, seabird densities, and prey swarm density and detectability. Application of the model to Black-browed Albatrosses foraging for Antarctic krill near South Georgia suggests that local enhancement is generally a highly effective foraging strategy, and that the fraction of time albatrosses spend in feeding flocks should show strong interactions between prey and conspecific densities. To test these predictions, we analyzed survey data collected near South Georgia in January-March 1986. Our analysis suggests a strong Allee-type density dependence in foraging success that was qualitatively and quantitatively consistent with model predictions.

Krill oil microencapsulation: Antioxidant activity, astaxanthin retention, encapsulation efficiency, fatty acids profile, in vitro bioaccessibility and storage stability	LWT-FOOD SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												Krill oil (KO) emulsions with a ratio of KO/arabic gum of 1:4 (w/w) were prepared and then spray dried. The effect of drying temperatures on antioxidant activity, astaxanthin retention, and microencapsulation efficiency was evaluated and microcapsules with better results were employed for further analysis. The encapsulation of KO in arabic gum was confirmed by using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. KO microcapsules showed eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic content of 21% of the total fatty acids, low omega-6/omega-3 and SF/unsaturated FA ratios, and a bioaccessibility of 53.8% after 2 h of in vitro digestion. The effect of a(w) on color change and degradation of astaxanthin contained in KO microcapsules was evaluated during storage at 35 degrees C. Monolayer value was 3.7241 g H2O/100 g d.s. which corresponds to 0.4 of a(w). The astaxanthin degradation rate increased considerably when the KO microcapsules were stored at an aw of 0.743, under these conditions the microcapsules showed drastic changes in the color parameters.																	0023-6438	1096-1127				JUL	2021	147								111476	10.1016/j.lwt.2021.111476							WOS:000685055700005

The present study examines the fine-scale (i.e. I km unit) distribution and abundance of four seabird species as a function of distance from a breeding colony (for three of the four species) and nekton density determined hydroacoustically. We found that density of the breeding species was significantly associated with nekton density, alter controlling for island effects. In addition, nekton density associated with foraging aggregations of seabirds was significantly higher than that under resting aggregations. These results provide some of the dearest evidence of seabird-nekton association, albeit on an extremely close spatial scale.																	1054-6006					JUN	1998	7	2					126	135		10.1046/j.1365-2419.1998.00057.x							WOS:000075695200005

On the timing of moulting processes in reproductively active Northern krill Meganyctiphanes norvegica	MARINE BIOLOGY												The interactions between moult phasing, growth and environmental cues in Northern krill (Meganyctiphanes norvegica) were examined through analysing populations at seasonal, weekly, and daily timescales. The analyses were carried out on resident populations of krill found in three different neritic locations that experience similar environmental signals (the Clyde Sea, Scotland; the Kattegat, Denmark; Gullmarsfjord, Sweden). Seasonal analyses were carried out on the Clyde Sea population and showed that moulting frequency increased significantly moving from winter to summer. The proportion of moulting females in summer samples was often more than double the proportion of moulting males, suggesting that females had a comparatively shorter intermoult period (IMP). Weekly samples taken from the Kattegat showed a similar pattern. However, although the difference between the proportion of female and male moulters was significant in one week, it was not another, mainly because of the variability in the proportion of female moulters. Such variability in females was equally evident in the daily samples taken at Gullmarsfjord. It suggests that females have a shorter IMP (12.5 days) than males (18.4 days) and are more likely to moult in synchrony. Nevertheless, the daily samples revealed that males are also capable of moult synchronisation, although less frequently than females. Shortened IMPs in females were not a result of the abbreviation of specific moult stages. Accordingly, reproductive activity did not alter the course of the normal moult cycle. There was no significant difference between the total body lengths of males and females indicating that females achieve the same levels of growth despite moulting more frequently and having to provision the energy-rich ovaries. This is in contrast to most other crustaceans where the energy costs of reproduction reduce female growth. The fact that females were less abundant than males, probably by suffering a greater level of mortality, suggests that different behavioural strategies, particularly vertical migration regimes, were adopted by each sex to maximise growth and reproduction.

Energy and materials for reproduction may also be totally derived from stored lipid and bodily protein. The predominant storage products are wax esters, often visible as translucent droplets or a fusiform inclusion in the tissues. Lipid may constitute more than 50% of dry weight at the end of summer. Reproduction is synchronized with season and environmental conditions to enable offspring to exploit the brief period of intense primary production. So far as we know, fertilization occurs only once in the copepods studied here, which make up more than 98% of the total zooplankton by numbers, and males are short lived, but in one species (Calanus hyperboreus) females may survive into a second productive season, thereby storing sufficient reserves to spawn a second time. Several planktonic species, including larval invertebrates, start growth early by utilizing algae that develop on the under-ice surface several months before the pelagic phytoplankton bloom. The minimum water temperature (-1.8-degrees-C) is constant and much warmer than the atmosphere, so overwintering should be less stressful for aquatic species than for terrestrial forms. Additional adaptations used by zooplankton in winter include seeking deeper water to escape predation, reducing swimming costs by regulating buoyancy, and further lowering metabolic rates by limiting synthesis of enzymes and increasing the fraction of lipid used in respiration.																	0004-0843					DEC	1993	46	4					303	311									WOS:A1993MQ45000004

Short moan call reveals seasonal occurrence and diel-calling pattern of crabeater seals in the Weddell Sea, Antarctica	BIOACOUSTICS-THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ANIMAL SOUND AND ITS RECORDING												Crabeater seals (Lobodon carcinophaga) are an important component of the Southern Ocean as they are the most abundant pinniped species in this krill-based ecosystem; however, their acoustic repertoire and ecology remain to be fully described. Seasonal occurrence and diel-calling pattern of crabeater seal off the Maud Rise, eastern Weddell Sea, are described using passive acoustic monitoring data collected over 8 months (mid-January to mid-September) in 2014. We describe a new call type of crabeater seals, the short moan call (mean 90% duration: 2.2 +/- 0.3 (SD) s, peak frequency: 596.5 +/- 109.4 Hz, and frequency range: 122-1024 Hz), which was the only detected call type and 1871 calls were enumerated. Those crabeater seal calls were detected from April until mid-September (with peak in calling around September), which coincided with the appearance of sea ice. Short moan call rates were highest at night in August (i.e., 6.4 calls per minute) and September, and showed no diel variations for April through July. Distance to the sea ice edge and month of the year were the most important predictors of call occurrence and call rates of crabeater seals. This study highlights the Maud Rise as a useful habitat for this species.

Data from two cruises conducted near the South Shetland Islands (SSIs) and the Elephant Island (EI), one in austral summer of 2004 and one in austral winter of 2006, were analyzed to provide a broad picture of the circulation pattern over the continental slope of the surveyed area, and an insight into the dynamical balance of the circulation. The results indicate that southwestward currents are present over the upper slope in the study area, indicating the ASC in the WAP region. Near the Shackleton Gap (SG) north of the EI, the southwestward slope currents near the shelf break are characterized by a water mass colder and fresher than the ambient water, which produces cross-slope density gradients and then vertical shear of the along-slope (or along-isobath) velocity. The vertical shear is associated with a reversal of the along-slope current from northeastward at surface to southwestward in deeper layers, or a depth-intensification of the southwestward slope currents. The water mass with temperature and salinity characteristics similar to the observed cold and fresh water is also revealed on the southern slope of the Scotia Sea, suggesting that this cold and fresh water is originated from the Scotia Sea slope and flows southwestward through the SG. Over the shelf north of the SSIs, the cold and fresh water mass is also observed and originates mainly from the Bransfield Strait. In this area, vertical structure of the southwestward slope currents is associated with the onshore intrusion of the upper Circumpolar Deep Water that creates cross-slope density gradients.																	1672-5182	1993-5021				APR	2018	17	2					420	432		10.1007/s11802-018-3353-9							WOS:000427906900023

The data indicate that C. acutus and R. gigas have the bases of their distributional ranges (sensu Makarov et al. 1982) in the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) and in the Warm Deep Water (WDW) entering the Weddell Gyre (WG). C. propinquus lived mainly in the cold WG south of the ACC. C. acutus overwintered mainly in the WG as stage IV copepodites (C). The species mainly inhabited the layers below the T(max)degrees stratum and down to 2000 m, but C V and females occurred slightly higher than C III and IV. Males prevailed over females and were confined to a rather narrow layer between 500 and 1000 m. Feeding experiments suggested all deep-living stages to be resting. However, if this species spawns in late autumn the younger C I-II can stay in the Winter Water (WW). R. gigas inhabited mainly the T(max)degrees stratum. In the eastern part of the WG, R. gigas breed in the WDW in autumn and hibernate as C I-III and C V-VI in the first and second winter, respectively. In the ACC zone, however, its life cycle is different and winter breeding of overwintered adults occurs. Most of the C. propinquus population overwintered in the WG as C III-V, inhabiting the WW. In the upper water layers in the interior of the WG, C III dominated with upto 18,000 individuals 1,000 m3. Shallow living C. propinquus were in the active, feeding state. Persistence of active feeding zooplankton populations in the WW of the WG can be an important factor influencing processes of phytoplankton development and the particle flux.																	0722-4060	1432-2056				JUL	1993	13	5					333	346									WOS:A1993LP06200007

Survey design, sampling protocols, and data analysis procedures are described. Mean krill density across the survey area was estimated to be 21.4 gm(-2), and total biomass was estimated to be 44.3 million tonnes (CV 11.4%). This biomass estimate leads to a revised estimate of precautionary yield for krill in the Scotia Sea of 4 million tonnes. However, before the fishery can be permitted to expand to this level, it will be necessary to establish mechanisms to avoid concentration of fishing effort, particularly near colonies of land-breeding krill predators, and to consider the effects of krill immigrating into the region from multiple sources.

Estimating recruitment variability and productivity in Antarctic krill	FISHERIES RESEARCH												Three alternative forms of the spawner-recruit relationship - the Beverton-Holt and two expressions of the Ricker function - and a fourth form representing annual recruitment deviations without an explicit relationship to spawning biomass, were applied in an integrated assessment model for Antarctic krill. Model data were from the international krill fishery and U.S. AMLR surveys in the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR) Subarea 48.1, the area around the Antarctic peninsula where the majority of recent fishing for krill has taken place. Sensitivity tests using pre-specified values for the standard deviation of the logarithm of annual recruitment residuals (sigma(R)) and productivity (steepness, h) for the relationship between spawning biomass and subsequent recruitment indicated that neither the Beverton-Holt nor Ricker functions were superior to configurations of the model that did not assume a spawner-recruit relationship. As the predictive power of the spawner-recruit functions was reduced by increasing the value of sigma(R) the fit to the data improved. All the functions fitted the data best when sigma(R) was large enough so that random recruitment with respect to spawning biomass was produced. The alternative functions produced the same time series of recruitment and spawning biomass estimates when they were determined by the data rather than forced towards an assumed relationship. Although the Beverton-Holt and Ricker models were poor predictors of the data, cross correlations of the recruitment predictions with the spawning biomass predictions from the best models indicated that recruitment was statistically correlated with spawning biomasses in the previous two to four years. The highest correlation (0.58) was with spawning biomass three years previously. Correlations in the reverse direction, with spawning biomass following recruitment were insignificant. These results suggest that recruitment variability does not influence subsequent spawning biomass in krill. They leave open the possibility that krill spawning biomass could influence subsequent recruitment, but not as modeled in the Beverton-Holt or Ricker functions with a one-year lag and the pre-specified von Bertalanffy growth.																	0165-7836	1872-6763				SEP	2019	217				SI		98	107		10.1016/j.fishres.2018.09.027							WOS:000473841400010

Thus, we examined the spatial distribution of pelagic cnidarians from the oceanic to neritic zone off Ad,lie Land, East Antarctica. Discrete depth sampling was conducted from the surface to 2,000 m depth from late January to early February 2008. In total, 3347 individuals representing 45 species/taxa from eight orders were collected. Cluster analysis revealed three major clusters: (1) an epipelagic group in the oceanic zone composed mainly of Pegantha martagon, the abundance and species diversity of which were very low; (2) a meso- and bathy-pelagic group characterised by high abundance and species diversity with dominance of Dimophyes arctica, Vogtia serrata, and Halicreas minimum; and (3) a neritic group represented by a high abundance of Diphyes antarctica. Cnidarian communities in the epipelagic zone were divided by hydrographic structures such as the Southern Boundary of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current and Antarctic Slope Front, whereas those in the meso- and bathy-pelagic layers dominated by circumpolar deep water were relatively stable with higher diversity throughout the oceanic zone.

The amount of acid-soluble fractions increased with increasing time of deacetylation. The acid-soluble fractions were characterized with respect to fraction of acetylated units (F-A), diad frequencies, intrinsic viscosities, molecular weights and molecular weight distributions. F-A values for the acid-insoluble fractions were obtained using CPMAS C-13 NMR spectroscopy. As a control, the F-A values for the acid-soluble fractions determined from CPMAS C-13 NMR spectroscopy were compared and found to be consistent with the F-A values from H-1 NMR spectroscopy. The diad frequencies indicated that the acetyl groups in the acid-soluble fractions of the commercially heterogeneously deacetylated chitosans were randomly distributed. Determination of [eta], M(w) and M(w)/M(n) indicated negligible depolymerization of the acid-soluble fractions when deacetylation was performed under a nitrogen purge at 75 degrees C. Chemical characterization revealed compositional heterogeneity in the chitosans, with chitin-like acid-insoluble fractions with F-A values between 0.88 and 0.95, and acid-soluble fractions with F-A values from 0.20 to 0.52.

Estimates of recruitment in both regions show a nonlinear relationship between recruitment and sea ice area in the combined Bellingshausen and Amundsen Seas from the previous winter and spring, with large recruitment events occurring over a narrow range of ice area, and minimal recruitment otherwise.

Enhancing the ecosystem approach for the fishery for Antarctic krill within the complex, variable, and changing ecosystem at South Georgia	ICES JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE												The objective of the ecosystem approach to fisheries management is to sustain healthy marine ecosystems and the fisheries they support. One of the earliest implementations was in the Southern Ocean, where decision rules and stock reference points were developed for managing the Antarctic krill fishery, together with an ecosystem-monitoring programme intended to aid management decisions. This latter component has not been incorporated directly into management, so here, we consider variability in the krill fishery at South Georgia, relating it to physical and biological monitoring indices, finding sea surface temperature to be a key correlate with both annual catch and long-term biological indices. Some indices from krill predators showed significant positive relationships with krill harvesting in the preceding winter, presumably indicative of the importance of winter foraging conditions. We explore how ecological structure affects results, examining two monitoring sites 100km apart. Results suggest different biological conditions at the two sites, probably reflecting different scales of ecosystem operation, emphasizing that an appreciation of scale will enhance krill fishery management. Finally, in reviewing different drivers of ecological change, we identify important additional monitoring that would help better reflect ecosystem status, improve the utility of CEMP, providing information necessary for the ecosystem approach at South Georgia.																	1054-3139	1095-9289				SEP	2021	78	6					2065	2081		10.1093/icesjms/fsab092							WOS:000705457300011

The F- concentration in scute, cartilage, skin and gill increased with time and dietary F- concentration, and with the order of concentration at the end of the experiment, highest to lowest levels: scute (7721.3 mgF-kg-1), cartilage (2324.2), gill (721.4) and skin (262.5). Muscle, liver, gut and pylorus did not accumulate F- with increasing F- level in the diet. Thus, F- up to 360.8mgF-kg-1 can be included in the Siberian sturgeon diet without an adverse effect on growth or survival. The F- as low as 162.6mgF-kg-1 in diet increased F- concentrations in scute and cartilage, and the high concentration of F- in cartilage is possibly a danger to the consumption of cartilage in sturgeon.																	1355-557X					JAN	2013	44	2					176	181		10.1111/j.1365-2109.2011.03021.x							WOS:000313245300003

Determination of Digestibility, Tissue Deposition, and Metabolism of the Omega-3 Fatty Acid Content of Krill Protein Concentrate in Growing Rats	JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL AND FOOD CHEMISTRY												Krill protein concentrate (KPC) consists of high-quality protein (77.7% dry basis) and lipids (8.1% dry basis) that are rich (27% of total fatty acids) in omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (omega-3 PUFAs). The objective of the study was to determine digestibility, tissue deposition, metabolism, and tissue oxidative stability of the omega-3 PUFAs provided by KPC. Young female Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 10/group) were fed ad libitum isocaloric diets for 4 weeks with either 10% freeze-dried KPC or 10% casein. The casein diet contained 5.3% added corn oil (CO), whereas the KPC contained 5.3% total lipids from 0.9% krill oil (KO) provided by KPC and 4.4% added corn oil (KO + CO). Fatty acid compositions of various tissues were analyzed by gas chromatography. Lipid peroxidation was determined by thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS). Total antioxidant capacity and urinary eicosanoid metabolites were determined by enzyme immunoassay. The omega-3 PUFAs provided in KO from KPC increased (P = 0.003) docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) concentration in the brain. DHA and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) content in fat pads and liver were increased (P < 0.01), whereas the omega-6 PUFA, arachidonic acid (AA), was decreased (P < 0.01) in rats fed the KPC diet containing the KO + CO mixture compared to rats fed the casein diet containing pure CO. Feeding the KPC diet decreased pro-inflammatory 2-series prostaglandin and thromboxane metabolites. There was no significant difference in TBARS or total antioxidant capacity in the tissues of rats fed the different diets. On the basis of the study results, the low amount of omega-3 PUFAs provided by the KO content of KPC provides beneficial effects of increasing tissue EPA and DHA deposition and reduced AA-derived 2-series eicosanoid metabolites without increasing lipid peroxidation. Therefore, consumption of KPC has the potential to provide a healthy and sustainable source of omega-3 PUFAs.

Intra-and inter-seasonal variations in krill biomass density and dispersion were derived from the re-processed data set for surveys conducted in the austral summers of 1991/1992 through 2001/2002. Estimated biomass density ranged from I to 60 g m(-2), decreasing from mid-range levels in 1991/1992 to a minimum in 1992/1993-1993/1994, increasing to a peak in 1996/1997-1997/1998, and decreasing again through 2000/2001-2001/2002. Although this variability may be attributed to changes in the spatial distribution of krill relative to the survey area, comparisons with the proportion of juvenile krill in simultaneous net samples suggest that the changes in biomass density are consistent with apparent changes in reproductive success. A truncated Fourier series fit to the biomass density time series is dominated by an 8-year cycle and predicts all increase in krill biomass density in 2002/2003 and 2003/2004. This prediction is supported by an apparent association between cycles in the extent of sea ice cover and per-capita krill recruitment over the last 23 years and indications that ice cover in the winter of 2002 is seasonally early and extensive.

There was much intraannual variability, with a trend for increasing biomass from January-February (Leg I) to February-March (Leg II), except in the 1993 studies. There was also a change in phytoplankton composition between the two legs. During 1990-1991 the increase was due mostly to diatoms, during 1992 mostly to an increase of flagellates; during 1993 there was a decrease in total biomass between the two legs, with diatoms decreasing, so that dinoflagellates, which increased slightly in numbers, dominated the biomass during the second leg. There was also much inter-annual variability, with the summers of 1990-1991 having greater biomass and higher proportions of microplanktonic diatoms than that of 1992-1993, which had a higher proportion of flagellates. Cluster analyses revealed the presence of four major phytoplankton assemblages, with varying geographical distributions. The northwestern portion of the grid (Drake Passage waters), was characterized by nanoplanktonic diatoms during 1990-1991 and 1993, but by nanoplanktonic flagellates during 1992. The central area (Drake-Bransfield confluence) was characterized by microplanktonic diatoms in 1990-1991, but by cryptophytes or flagellates in 1992-1993. The south and southeastern portion of the area (Bransfield Strait waters) was characterized mainly by either cryptophytes or other flagellates during all 4 yr. The spatial and temporal variability of phytoplankton could not be ascribed specifically to the geographical extent of the different water masses found in the study area, but appears to be due to changing growth conditions in the upper water column as influenced by physical mixing and meteorological conditions, as well as to effects of differential grazing.

The significance of the moult cycle to cold tolerance in the Antarctic collembolan Cryptopygus antarcticus	JOURNAL OF INSECT PHYSIOLOGY												Research into the ecophysiology of arthropod cold tolerance has largely focussed on those parts of the year and/or the life cycle in which cold stress is most likely to be experienced, resulting in an emphasis on studies of the preparation for and survival in the over-wintering state. However, the non-feeding stage of the moult cycle also gives rise to a period of increased cold hardiness in some microarthropods and, as a consequence, a proportion of the field population is cold tolerant even during the summer active period. In the case of the common Antarctic springtail Cryptopygus antarcticus, the proportion of time spent in this non-feeding stage is extended disproportionately relative to the feeding stage as temperature is reduced. As a result, the proportion of the population in a cold tolerant state, with low supercooling points (SCPs), increases at lower temperatures. We found that, at 5 degrees C, about 37% of the population are involved in ecdysis and exhibit low SCPs. At 2 degrees C this figure increased to 50% and, at 0 degrees C, we estimate that 80% of the population will have increased cold hardiness as a result of a prolonged non-feeding, premoult period. Thus, as part of the suite of life history and ecophysiological features that enable this Antarctic springtail to survive in its hostile environment, it appears that it can take advantage of and extend the use of a pre-existing characteristic inherent within the moulting cycle.

Fishing ground selection in the Antarctic krill fishery: Trends in patterns across years, seasons and nations	CCAMLR SCIENCE												Patterns of fishing ground selection were characterised using STATLANT and CCAMLR fine-scale data. Among the 15 small-scale management units (SSMUs) within Subareas 48.1, 48.2 and 48.3, including the pelagic SSMUs, only one-third were identified as major contributors to the total catch. A recent shift in operational timing towards later months within fishing seasons was observed in Subarea 48.1 (December-February to March-May). However, operational timing has remained relatively constant in Subareas 48.2 (March-May) and 48.3 (June-August). In 25 years of krill operations in Area 48, patterns of SSMU usage have changed. Three different patterns of seasonal SSMU selection were characterised using a cluster analysis. Frequently used SSMUs did not always match the areas of high krill density observed by scientific surveys, and possible reasons for this mismatch are further discussed. A revised format for data submission is suggested in order to accommodate possible developments in fishing techniques.

J	Metillo, EB; Ritz, DA				Metillo, EB; Ritz, DA			Differential chemosensory feeding behaviour by three co-occurring mysids (Crustacea, Mysidacea) from southeastern Tasmania	COMPARATIVE BIOCHEMISTRY AND PHYSIOLOGY A-MOLECULAR & INTEGRATIVE PHYSIOLOGY												Three mysid species showed differences in chemosensory feeding as judged from stereotyped food capturing responses to dissolved mixtures of feeding stimulant (either betaine-HCl or glycine) and suppressant (ammonium). The strongest responses were to 50:50 mixtures of both betaine-ammonium and glycine-ammonium solutions. In general, the response curve to the different mixtures tested was bell-shaped. Anisomysis mixta australis only showed the normal curve in response to the glycine-ammonium mixture. The platykurtic curve for Tenagomysis tasmaniae suggests a less optimal response to the betaine-HCl-ammonium solution. Paramesopodopsis rufa reacted more strongly to the betaine-ammonium than to the glycine-ammonium solutions, and more individuals of this species responded to both solutions than the other two species. It is suggested that these contrasting chemosensitivities of the three coexisting mysid species serve as a means of partitioning the feeding niche. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

At the same time, within pairs, males and females may have conflicting optimal reproductive strategies. As a result, they may adjust their level of parental investment differently according to the sex of the young. In this study, we examined whether Adelie penguin (Pygoscelis adeliae) chicks were sexually dimorphic and whether parents adjusted their parental investment accordingly. Male chicks were on average approximately 10% heavier than female chicks but not larger. Despite the presumed additional cost associated with male chick growth, no fitness cost differences were observed between parents rearing 1 chick whatever its sex: Adult body mass changes and resight rates during the subsequent breeding season were similar. However, the sex of offspring affected the duration of foraging trips during the early guard stage: At this stage, female adults rearing a female chick performed longer foraging trips than female adults rearing a male chick and males rearing either a male or a female chick. We propose that, because female adults present a lower survival rate after a breeding attempt, they are more prone to modify their level of parental investment than male adults. Moreover, the modulation of the foraging behavior by female adults according to the sex of the chick is likely to reduce intraspecific competition at a time when resource availability at sea is not optimal and when food requirement for female chicks may be lower than for male chicks.

Winter and spring controls on the summer food web of the coastal West Antarctic Peninsula	NATURE COMMUNICATIONS												Understanding the mechanisms by which climate variability affects multiple trophic levels in food webs is essential for determining ecosystem responses to climate change. Here we use over two decades of data collected by the Palmer Long Term Ecological Research program (PAL-LTER) to determine how large-scale climate and local physical forcing affect phytoplankton, zooplankton and an apex predator along the West Antarctic Peninsula (WAP). We show that positive anomalies in chlorophyll-a (chl-a) at Palmer Station, occurring every 4-6 years, are constrained by physical processes in the preceding winter/spring and a negative phase of the Southern Annular Mode (SAM). Favorable conditions for phytoplankton included increased winter ice extent and duration, reduced spring/summer winds, and increased water column stability via enhanced salinity-driven density gradients. Years of positive chl-a anomalies are associated with the initiation of a robust krill cohort the following summer, which is evident in Adelie penguin diets, thus demonstrating tight trophic coupling. Projected climate change in this region may have a significant, negative impact on phytoplankton biomass, krill recruitment and upper trophic level predators in this coastal Antarctic ecosystem.

Krill growth and condition in Western Indian Ocean sector of the Southern Ocean 30-80 degrees E in austral summer 2006	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY												Krill growth and physiological condition were measured during the Baseline Research on Oceanography, Krill and the Environment - West (BROKE-West) large-scale survey of the Western Indian Ocean sector (30-80 degrees E) of the Southern Ocean. Krill growth and condition were related to sea-surface temperature (SST) and Chlorophyll a levels. Estimates of Antarctic krill growth were obtained using the Instantaneous Growth Rate (IGR) technique, which reflects in situ growth of krill during the intermoult period prior to capture. A total of 10,362 krill were incubated in the IGR experiments conducted on board the research vessel. The average growth rate ranged between 1.8-9.6% of body length throughout the study area (n=1557). Juvenile and sub-adult krill showed higher growth rates compared to adults. Growth decreased with size for krill of all maturity classes, with the largest krill (total length >50 mm) expressing negative growth. On average, mean growth was higher (6.5%) in the western section (30-55 degrees E) of the study area compared to the east (56-80 degrees E) (4.2%). In the western section significantly higher growth rates were recorded for krill sampled close to the ice-edge (8.4%) compared to the open ocean (4.2%), which may be due to the presence of phytoplankton blooms associated with the retreating sea ice. However, in the eastern sector higher growth rates occurred in krill from the open ocean compared to the krill caught in areas closer to the coast (5.4% and 2.6% respectively). Krill condition was measured in terms of digestive gland size as a percentage of carapace length. The size of krill digestive gland relative to carapace length ranged from 0.46 to 0.66 (n=2403). A significant positive correlation was found between growth rate and size of the digestive gland (r(2)=0.7), indicating that growth is related to feeding events. Both digestive gland size and krill growth significantly increased with increasing Chlorophyll a levels and declining SST. Crown Copyright (C) 2009 Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												Feeding of the krill Meganyctiphanes norvegica was studied at a 120 m and a 200 m deep site in the Oslofjord, Norway, Converting stomach content of copepod mandibles and gut fluorescence into carbon equivalents suggested that the highest carbon gain was from carnivorous feeding, although contribution from herbivorous feeding was of the same order of magnitude in spring. High daytime gut fluorescence during spring suggested that sedimenting algae were efficiently cropped in deep water, On other occasions algae were exploited during nocturnal vertical migrations. In late summer, M. norvegica acted as a selectively feeding carnivore, primarily preying on Temora longicornis during nocturnal migrations to upper layers, Algal food was neglected at this time. During winter, the feeding conditions differed between the 2 stations. Estimated carbon equivalents of the stomach content were high at the shallowest site, and low at the deepest site. We ascribe this difference to the ability of M. norvegica to visually detect and exploit overwintering Calanus spp. during daytime at the 120 m station, while Calanus spp. overwintered below the daytime depth of M, norvegica at the 200 m deep station. Cyclopoid copepods were normally under-represented in the stomach contents.																	0171-8630						2002	228						193	204		10.3354/meps228193							WOS:000174655000017

Zooplankton abundance was assessed by employing a new design of sampler that combined a frame net with a pump at the cod-end and which was deployed at the sea surface. Six transects using the sampler with concurrent bird observations were made over a short stretch of Stewart Strait near Bird island, South Georgia. Concentrations of a variety of zooplankton species occurred patchily along each transect. Peak numbers of prions were recorded consistently towards the southern end of each transect. These peaks coincided with peaks in zooplankton numbers, but with different prey species predominant on different occasions. Comparison of the distribution of foraging and sitting birds with the presence or absence of zooplankton peaks, after pooling zooplankton species into 2 broad classes, showed that birds were consistently observed over copepod maxima, but were not found to be associated with aggregations of larger zooplankton more often than expected by chance.

We investigated the effects of alternative food materials, hen egg yolk (HEY) and exoskeleton-free (skinned) Antarctic krill (SAK), on the growth and survival of eel larvae. We found that feed comprising whole krill including exoskeleton (WAK) containing higher levels of fluoride (37.89mgkg(-1)) was acutely toxic to eel larvae exposed to this alone. In contrast, extract from SAK containing lower concentrations of fluoride (4.25mgkg(-1)) showed no apparent adverse effects. Growth of larvae fed a mixture of SE and SAK in a feed trial of 58days [mean body weight (BW), 6.0mg] was about twofold higher than that of larvae fed a mixture of SE and WAK (3.2mg) (P<0.01). A mixture of HEY and SAK also had some dietary benefits for eel larvae, enabling them to survive for up to 58days and to grow significantly (mean BW, 2.4mg), compared with their initial weight (mean BW, 0.2mg) (P< 0.001). Although additional nutritional improvements are needed, the present results suggest that combination diet HEY and SAK may be a good alternative to SE as an effective diet for eel larvae.																	1355-557X					SEP	2013	44	10					1531	1538		10.1111/j.1365-2109.2012.03160.x							WOS:000323930400005						
J	Watanabe, YY; Baranov, EA; Miyazaki, N				Watanabe, Yuuki Y.; Baranov, Eugene A.; Miyazaki, Nobuyuki			Ultrahigh foraging rates of Baikal seals make tiny endemic amphipods profitable in Lake Baikal	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA												Understanding what, how, and how often apex predators hunt is important due to their disproportionately large effects on ecosystems. In Lake Baikal with rich endemic fauna, Baikal seals appear to eat, in addition to fishes, a tiny (<0.1 g) endemic amphipod Macrohectopus branickii (the world's only freshwater planktonic species). Yet, its importance as prey to seals is unclear. Globally, amphipods are rarely targeted by single-prey feeding (i.e., nonfilter-feeding) mammals, presumably due to their small size. If M. branickii is energetically important prey, Baikal seals would exhibit exceptionally high foraging rates, potentially with behavioral and morphological specializations. Here, we used animal-borne accelerometers and video cameras to record Baikal seal foraging behavior. Unlike the prevailing view that they predominantly eat fishes, they also hunted M. branickii at the highest rates (mean, 57 individuals per dive) ever recorded for single-prey feeding aquatic mammals, leading to thousands of catches per day. These rates were achieved by gradual changes in dive depth following the diel vertical migration of M. branickii swarms. Examining museum specimens revealed that Baikal seals have the most specialized comb-like postcanine teeth in the subfamily Phocinae, allowing them to expel water while retaining prey during high-speed foraging. Our findings show unique mammal-amphipod interactions in an ancient lake, demonstrating that organisms even smaller than krill can be important prey for single-prey feeding aquatic mammals if the environment and predators' adaptations allow high foraging rates. Further, our finding that Baikal seals directly eat macroplankton may explain why they are so abundant in this ultraoligotrophic lake.

Polar marine ecosystems are characterized by low biodiversity and high biological patchiness. The distribution of predators, as a consequence, shows a similar patchiness. During two expeditions of icebreaking RV Polarstern in June-July 2011, biodiversity in the arctic marine zone north of 70A degrees N was very low, with low numbers of species: 20 seabirds, eight cetaceans, five pinnipeds and polar bear. Moreover, a few species accounted for the majority in numbers: four bird species for 95 % of the total of 23,000 seabirds recorded during 700 transect counts: fulmar Fulmarus glacialis, kittiwake Rissa tridactyla, Brunnich's guillemot Uria lomvia and little auk Alle alle. Among the marine mammals, 250 fin whales Balaenoptera physalus accounted for 80 % of the identified large cetaceans, 270 white-beaked dolphin Lagenorhynchus albirostris for 100 % of the small cetaceans and 180 harp seals Pagophilus groenlandica for 80 % of the identified pinnipeds. Their quantitative distribution was depending on water masses and oceanic fronts, large cetaceans-mainly fin whales-showing an important aggregation on the shelf slope off western Spitsbergen, as well as little auks and Brunnich's guillemots. So that this zone, shelf slope and front of mixed Arctic/Atlantic Waters, showed unusually high seabird and cetacean concentrations. Seasonal factors possibly influencing their distribution are addressed.																	0722-4060	1432-2056				NOV	2014	37	11					1645	1657		10.1007/s00300-014-1551-5							WOS:000343141300008

Temporal concentrations of sunscreen compounds (Mycosporine-like Amino Acids) in phytoplankton and in the New Zealand krill, Nyctiphanes australis GO Sars	JOURNAL OF PLANKTON RESEARCH												This study investigated the relationship between seasonal changes in ambient UV-R, and sunscreen concentrations in phytoplankton and krill. Concentrations of mycosprine-like amino acid (MAA) sunscreens were quantified in phytoplankton communities and in the krill Nyctiphanes australis over a 1-year period off the Otago Coast, New Zealand. Ambient UV-B and UV-A ranged from a minimum mean daily dose of 2.19 x 10(4) kJ day(-1) and 0.73 x 10(6) kJ day(-1) in June, to a maximum in January of 20.19 x 10(4) kJ day(-1) and 4.88 x 10(6) kJ day(-1), respectively. Concentrations of MAAs (consisting almost entirely of Mycosporine-glycine) in the phytoplankton community were lowest in August (5.6 nmol mu g(-1) Chl) when UV-R irradiances were minimal and highest in January (41.4 nmol mu g(-1) Chl) when UV-R irradiances were maximal. Nyctiphanes australis was found to contain five identified MAAs (mycosporine-glycine, shinorine, Porphyra-334, palythine and palythinol) and several unknown UV-R absorbing compounds. Concentrations ranged from 4.73 to 15.51 nmol mg(-1) dw, with little indication of a seasonal cycle that could be correlated with changes in either phytoplankton MAA concentrations or ambient UV-R irradiances. The findings suggest that krill are neither accumulating MAAs in response to changes in MAA concentrations in their phytoplankton food, or that MAA concentrations in krill are increased in response to higher ambient UV-R irradiances. Concentrations of MAAs in krill body parts (carapace, legs, eyes, antennae, muscle) were similar (4.89-5.98 nmol mg(-1) dw), with the exception of the carapace (2.03 nmol mg(-1) dw).

Modeling the Impact of Ocean Circulation on Chlorophyll Blooms Around South Georgia, Southern Ocean	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS												The northeast periphery of the Scotia Sea hosts one of the largest chlorophyll-a blooms of the Southern Ocean. This bloom peaks to the northwest of the island of South Georgia, extending eastward for hundreds of kilometers. Although the Southern Ocean has many islands of similar size, South Georgia is ecologically one of the most significant: It not only sustains one of the Southern Ocean's largest and most diverse ecosystems but also constitutes its single most important region for biological carbon sequestration. While the exceptional nature of South Georgia's blooms has been recognized widely, both the physical processes that contribute to their fertilization and the reasons why these blooms are larger than those of other similar regions (e.g., Kerguelen or Crozet Islands) are poorly understood. We use the results of a high-resolution ocean model to investigate the physical processes that mediate the entrainment of deep, iron-rich waters into the surface layers of the South Georgia region. We show that the Southern Antarctic Circumpolar Current Front, the southernmost jet of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC), pumps iron-enriched waters from the deep ocean onto the bottom layers of South Georgia's shelf. These waters are upwelled along the northern coast of the island and are then exported into the Georgia Basin, where topographically steered circulation shields them from the dispersive effects of local currents and eddies, thus allowing the bloom development.				combes, vincent/AAA-2343-2020	combes, vincent/0000-0002-0416-1827; Matano, Ricardo/0000-0001-5177-4610; Meredith, Michael/0000-0002-7342-7756												2169-9275	2169-9291				SEP	2020	125	9							e2020JC016391	10.1029/2020JC016391							WOS:000576619900039

Antarctic krill population genomics: apparent panmixia, but genome complexity and large population size muddy the water	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY												Antarctic krill (Euphausiasuperba; hereafter krill) are an incredibly abundant pelagic crustacean which has a wide, but patchy, distribution in the Southern Ocean. Several studies have examined the potential for population genetic structuring in krill, but DNA-based analyses have focused on a limited number of markers and have covered only part of their circum-Antarctic range. We used mitochondrial DNA and restriction site-associated DNA sequencing (RAD-seq) to investigate genetic differences between krill from five sites, including two from East Antarctica. Our mtDNA results show no discernible genetic structuring between sites separated by thousands of kilometres, which is consistent with previous studies. Using standard RAD-seq methodology, we obtained over a billion sequences from >140krill, and thousands of variable nucleotides were identified at hundreds of loci. However, downstream analysis found that markers with sufficient coverage were primarily from multicopy genomic regions. Careful examination of these data highlights the complexity of the RAD-seq approach in organisms with very large genomes. To characterize the multicopy markers, we recorded sequence counts from variable nucleotide sites rather than the derived genotypes; we also examined a small number of manually curated genotypes. Although these analyses effectively fingerprinted individuals, and uncovered a minor laboratory batch effect, no population structuring was observed. Overall, our results are consistent with panmixia of krill throughout their distribution. This result may indicate ongoing gene flow. However, krill's enormous population size creates substantial panmictic inertia, so genetic differentiation may not occur on an ecologically relevant timescale even if demographically separate populations exist.

Crabeater seal diving behaviour in eastern Antarctica	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												Southern Ocean waters are highly productive and contain important food resources for many indigenous predators, including humans. Management of these resources has fallen under the regulation of the Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR), which has identified a suite of predators as indicator species for monitoring ecosystem fluctuations, including crabeater seals. For crabeater seals to fulfil this role, however, they must respond predictably to fluctuations in krill distribution and abundance. Here, we investigated the validity of using the diving behaviour of this species as an indicator of krill distribution and abundance. We used behavioural data collected from 23 crabeater seals fitted with satellite-linked time-depth recorders off eastern Antarctica to quantify habitat use as a function of the amount of time they spent within geographic regions with varying environmental characteristics. This was then linked with diving behaviour in those regions. By integrating geographic location and diving parameters, we demonstrated that habitat use and foraging behaviour within eastern Antarctic waters fluctuated in response to seasonal and spatial environmental variability. Our attempts to use oceanographic variables to develop models of crabeater seal habitat use and behaviour demonstrated real limitations in inferring behaviour from a simple set of environmental factors, but we identified ocean depth and the proximity to the ice edge as factors influencing seasonal habitat use and diving behaviour. Whilst our understanding of the influences driving crabeater seal distribution has improved as a result of telemetry studies, it would appear premature to infer cross-species patterns in distribution and abundance with krill given the low predictive power of models derived in the present study. Furthermore, the dynamic and regionally variable use of pelagic habitat by this widely abundant Antarctic predator has important implications for the estimation of crabeater seal biomass.

J	Werner, I				Werner, I			Grazing of Arctic under-ice amphipods on sea-ice algae	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												Feeding of the Arctic under-ice amphipods Apherusa glacialis, Onisimus spp. and Gammarus wilkitzkii on sea-ice algae was investigated in laboratory experiments. The specific ingestion rates of algal biomass declined with increasing size of the species (A. glacialis, 51; Onisimus spp., 11; G. wilkitzkii, 2 ng chl a equival. mg(-1) dry mass d(-1)). Juveniles of Onisimus spp. and G. wilkitzkii had specific rates that were 1 to 2 orders of magnitude higher than those of the respective adults. Calculations of the carbon budget and observations of amphipods behaviour indicate that A. glacialis is predominantely herbivorous, whereas Onisimus spp, are herbivorous/detritivorous, and G. wilkitzkii is herbivorous/detritivorous/carnivorous. The grazing impact on the ice-algal standing stock at the ice underside in summer, estimated for 2 different areas in the Arctic, was low (1.1% d(-1) in the Laptev Sea, 2.6 % d(-1) in the Greenland Sea), indicating that food is not a limiting factor in this habitat.																	0171-8630	1616-1599					1997	160						93	99		10.3354/meps160093							WOS:000071722800009

Environmental correlates of Antarctic krill distribution in the Scotia Sea and southern Drake Passage	ICES JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE												Antarctic krill is a key prey species for many vertebrate and invertebrate predators in the Southern Ocean; it is also an abundant fishery resource in the Scotia Sea and southern Drake Passage. Here, we identify environmental correlates of krill distribution utilizing acoustic data collected during an extensive international survey in January 2000. Separate models (at scales of 10-80 nautical miles) were derived for the full study area and for each of four subregions: northern and southern shelf waters, the seasonally ice-covered open ocean, and the generally ice-free open ocean. Krill distribution was strongly correlated with bathymetry; densities were higher over island shelves and shelf breaks and decreased with increasing distance offshore. Low krill densities occurred in areas of low chlorophyll concentration and high geostrophic velocity. Krill distribution was also related to sea level anomaly but relationships were not consistent between subregions. The models explained a maximum of 44% of the observed deviance in krill density, but did not reliably identify areas of high krill density in the open ocean, and explained a small proportion of the deviance (16%) in offshore areas covered seasonally by sea ice, probably because of the strong, residual influence of retreated ice. The commercial krill fishery is currently concentrated in shelf areas, where high densities of krill are most predictable. As krill are not predictable in the open ocean, the fishery is likely to remain principally a near-shore operation, and should be managed accordingly.

The molecular weights of CP-I, II, III and IV were determined to be 35.0, 41.2, 37.9 and 39.5 kDa, respectively, using sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). These proteases had optimal esterase activity at pH 8.0-8.5 and showed the highest activity at 60-70C. Crawfish proteases were rich in acidic amino acids. Activation energies for hydrolysis of tosyl arginine methyl ester (TAME) by these proteases were 6.98 - 8.34 kcal/mole. Unlike other serine proteases, the activities of CP-I and CP-II were activated by mercury while CP-III and IV were inhibited.																	0145-8884	1745-4514				AUG	2000	24	4					311	332		10.1111/j.1745-4514.2000.tb00703.x							WOS:000089287300004

Estimated development times for stage-structured marine organisms are biased if based only on survivors	JOURNAL OF PLANKTON RESEARCH												Stage duration is a key parameter in modeling population dynamics of stage-structured populations, however stage duration can be difficult to estimate accurately because calculations are based on survivors and fail to account for mortality. Here we show a method by which development time and stage duration can be adjusted after accounting for within-stage mortality. As an example, we use a previously published data set on stage-specific abundances of the euphausiid, Euphausia pacifica from four laboratory-incubated cohorts, raised from egg to juvenile stage. We used a stage-structured population model along with an inverse algorithm to estimate stage durations, both with and without considering mortality rates. Results suggest that the overall stage duration from egg to furcilia was similar to 48 days when mortality was considered, and similar to 60 days when mortality was not included. Stage-specific mortality rates were generally lower than 10% per day for those stages with relatively high mortality rates (egg and naupliar stages and furcilia VI-VII) and < 4% for other developmental stages. However, the difference between the estimates with and without considering mortality rates did not show a clear relationship with stage-specific mortality rates. More robust models that can incorporate the variability in developmental pathways and physiological changes that occur during the molting process may be necessary to further investigate how age distribution within stage and mortality influence the estimation of stage duration.

Starting in the Discovery era with Mackintosh at the King Edward Point labs on South Georgia, 1930, scientists have collected krill from sailing vessels, small boats, inflatable zodiacs and large ice-breaking vessels. Krill have been maintained in small and large jars, deep rectangular tanks, large round tanks and in flow-through and recycling systems. They have been maintained both on board research vessels and in laboratories, in flowing seawater systems at ambient conditions and in temperature-controlled environmental rooms. A few researchers have transported living krill back to their home laboratories, for example tropical laboratories in Japan (Murano) and Australia (Ikeda), temperate laboratories (Nicol) in Australia, a northern European laboratory in Germany (Marschall) and a sunny maritime laboratory in California (Ross and Quetin). The goals have been varied: short-term experiments to understand in situ physiological rates, long-term experiments to test the effects of manipulations or controlled changes in environmental conditions, and behavioral responses. We take you on a brief historical tour as we trace the lineage of modern day research on living Antarctic krill.																	1023-6244	1029-0362				DEC	2003	36	4					207	228		10.1080/10236240310001623385							WOS:000187994400004

Cold Regime Interannual Variability of Primary and Secondary Producer Community Composition in the Southeastern Bering Sea	PLOS ONE												Variability of hydrographic conditions and primary and secondary productivity between cold and warm climatic regimes in the Bering Sea has been the subject of much study in recent years, while interannual variability within a single regime and across multiple trophic levels has been less well-documented. Measurements from an instrumented mooring on the southeastern shelf of the Bering Sea were analyzed for the spring-to-summer transitions within the cold regime years of 2009-2012 to investigate the interannual variability of hydrographic conditions, primary producer biomass, and acoustically-derived secondary producer and consumer abundance and community structure. Hydrographic conditions in 2012 were significantly different than in 2009, 2010, and 2011, driven largely by increased ice extent and thickness, later ice retreat, and earlier stratification of the water column. Primary producer biomass was more tightly coupled to hydrographic conditions in 2012 than in 2009 or 2011, and shallow and mid-column phytoplankton blooms tended to occur independent of one another. There was a high degree of variability in the relationships between different classes of secondary producers and hydrographic conditions, evidence of significant intraconsumer interactions, and trade-offs between different consumer size classes in each year. Phytoplankton blooms stimulated different populations of secondary producers in each year, and summer consumer populations appeared to determine dominant populations in the subsequent spring. Overall, primary producers and secondary producers were more tightly coupled to each other and to hydrographic conditions in the coldest year compared to the warmer years. The highly variable nature of the interactions between the atmospherically-driven hydrographic environment, primary and secondary producers, and within food webs underscores the need to revisit how climatic regimes within the Bering Sea are defined and predicted to function given changing climate scenarios.

J	Seibel, BA; Dierssen, HM				Seibel, BA; Dierssen, HM			Cascading trophic impacts of reduced biomass in the Ross Sea, Antarctica: Just the tip of the iceberg?	BIOLOGICAL BULLETIN												A significant reduction in phytoplankton biomass in the Ross Sea was reported in the austral summer of 2000-2001, a possible consequence of a disruption in sea-ice retreat due to the presence of an immense iceberg, B15 (1) (Fig. 1). Our observations in McMurdo Sound suggest temporally and trophically cascading impacts of that depression in productivity. Reduced phytoplankton stocks clearly affected the pteropod Limacina helicina (Phipps, 1774) (Gastropoda: Mollusca), an abundant primary consumer in the region (2, 3), as indicated by depressed metabolic rates in 2000-2001. The following season, for the first time on record, L. helicina was absent from McMurdo Sound. Many important predators, including whales and fishes, rely heavily on L. helicina for food (3, 4). However, most obviously impacted by its absence was Clione antarctica (Smith, 1902), an abundant pteropod mollusc (Gastropoda) that feeds exclusively on L. helicina (5). Metabolic rates of C. antarctica were depressed by 50% in 2001-2002. Both L. helicina and C. antarctica are important components Of polar ecosystems and may be good indicators of overall ecosystem "health" in McMurdo Sound and perhaps in the Ross Sea. In this last austral summer, 2002-2003, sea-ice extent was much higher and phytoplankton stocks were dramatically lower than any reported previously, effects possibly associated with El Nino conditions, and we hypothesize that pteropods and their consumers may be further impacted.																	0006-3185	1939-8697				OCT	2003	205	2					93	97		10.2307/1543229							WOS:000186338800001	14583506

Antarctic krill fishery effects over penguin populations under adverse climate conditions: Implications for the management of fishing practices	AMBIO												Fast climate changes in the western Antarctic Peninsula are reducing krill density, which along with increased fishing activities in recent decades, may have had synergistic effects on penguin populations. We tested that assumption by crossing data on fishing activities and Southern Annular Mode (an indicator of climate change in Antarctica) with penguin population data. Increases in fishing catch during the non-breeding period were likely to result in impacts on both chinstrap (Pygoscelis antarcticus) and gentoo (P. papua) populations. Catches and climate change together elevated the probability of negative population growth rates: very high fishing catch on years with warm winters and low sea ice (associated with negative Southern Annular Mode values) implied a decrease in population size in the following year. The current management of krill fishery in the Southern Ocean takes into account an arbitrary and fixed catch limit that does not reflect the variability of the krill population under effects of climate change, therefore affecting penguin populations when the environmental conditions were not favorable.

J	Brierley, AS; Reid, K				Brierley, Andrew S.; Reid, Keith			Krill and the diversity of science and society: An introduction to the Third International Symposium on Krill	JOURNAL OF CRUSTACEAN BIOLOGY												Krill (class Malacostraca, order Euphausiacea) play important ecological roles in all of the world's oceans, and some species (e.g., Euphausia pacifica Hansen, 1911 and E. superba Dana, 1850) are fished commercially. The Third International Symposium on Krill was convened in June 2017 to provide an opportunity for face-to-face discussions of the latest global developments in krill research. Seventy-five delegates from 13 countries participated. Presentations were grouped into six sessions: 1) Group living: biology and behaviour; 2) Ecosystems: why are krill so successful?; 3) Myths and legends: links to ice, depth distribution, and population trajectories; 4) New approaches to bust the myths: technology and a look to the future; 5) Krill in winter; and 6) What can we scientists learn from krill fisheries? The final session was followed by an industry-sponsored workshop on krill fishing that was intended to provide an opportunity for dialogue between fishers and researchers. It is apparent that although many advances have been made in understanding the biology and ecology of krill in recent years, several fundamental questions remain (for example, 'how long do krill live?'). In recognition of this, and in an attempt to maintain momentum in krill research, Symposium participants proposed a new Working Group on krill to the Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research (SCAR), and the SCAR Krill Action Group (SKAG) was adopted in June 2018.																	0278-0372	1937-240X				NOV	2018	38	6					651	655		10.1093/jcbiol/ruy075							WOS:000456691100001

The drumsticks were used as a model for dark chicken meat processing by-products. The main objective of this study was conversion of dark chicken meat processing by-products to restructured functional food product. An attempt was made to develop functional food product that would resemble respective product made from boneless skinless chicken breast meat. A three-prong strategy to address diet-driven cardiovascular disease (CVD)with a functional food was used in this study. The strategy included addition of three ingredients with well-documented cardiovascular benefits: (i) omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid-rich oil (flaxseed-algae, 9:1); (ii) soluble fiber; and (iii) salt substitute. Titanium dioxide, potato starch, polyphosphate, and transglutaminase were also added. The batters were formulated and cooked resulting in heat-set gels. RESULTS: Color (L*a*b*), texture (torsion test, Kramer shear test, and texture profile analysis), thermal denaturation (differential scanning calorimetry), and gelation (dynamic rheology) of chicken drumstick gels and chicken breast gels were determined and compared. Chicken drumstick gels generally had comparable color and texture properties to the gels made from chicken breast meat. The endothermic transition (thermal denaturation) of myosin was more pronounced and gelation properties were better for the drumstick gels. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated a feasibility to develop functional food made of muscle proteins recovered with isoelectric solubilization/precipitation from low-value dark chicken meat processing by-products. The functional food developed in this study was enriched with CVD-beneficial nutrients and had comparable instrumental quality attributes to respective products made of chicken breast meat. Although the results of this study point towards the potential for a novel, marketable functional food product, sensory tests and storage stability study are recommended.

In this study, a novel in-situ method was developed for real-time detection of authenticity and adulteration of krill phospholipids with soybean phospholipids using an electric heating probe based rapid evaporative ionization mass spectrometry (REIMS). The commercial samples could be directly analyzed without preparation. The REIMS conditions were optimized such that the cauterizing duration was 3 s, the temperature of the heating probe was 450 degrees C and the flow rate of auxiliary solvent was 100 mu L min(-1). The compositions of krill and soybean phospholipids were analyzed by mass spectrometry, and the obtained data was used to establish the multivariate statistical models. The results indicated that the krill phospholipids could be successfully distinguished from soybean phospholipids with accuracy >= 96.58% on the basis of the characteristic ions of m/z 279.23, 301.22, 629.45, 807.43, 831.43 and 833.44. The effectiveness of these marker ions was proved by blind sample tests. This method provides a reference for evaluating the adulteration of krill phospholipids in the market and expands the application field of REIMS technology.																	0956-7135	1873-7129				MAR	2021	121								107680	10.1016/j.foodcont.2020.107680							WOS:000600405600008

A preliminary model of iron fertilisation by baleen whales and Antarctic krill in the Southern Ocean: Sensitivity of primary productivity estimates to parameter uncertainty	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING												Large marine animals may play a crucial role in storing and recycling bioavailable iron in surface waters by consuming iron-rich prey and subsequent defecation of iron that is excess to their requirements. This biological recycling of iron could enhance primary productivity in iron-limited waters. However, quantifying the effects of marine animals on ocean primary productivity remains challenging because of a limited understanding of the key biogeochemical processes involved. In this paper, we develop a preliminary model that explores these uncertainties and examines the potential effects of historical populations of blue, fin and humpback whales, and the biomass of Antarctic krill required to support the whale populations, on primary productivity in the Southern Ocean. Our results suggest that, despite conservative estimates for key processes in our model, pre-exploitation populations of blue whales and, to a lesser extent fin and humpback whales, could have contributed to iron recycling, resulting in enhanced phytoplankton production in iron-limited Southern Ocean waters. Iron-rich defecation by un-exploited whale populations in the Southern Ocean, and the biomass Antarctic krill required to support them, could have resulted in a contribution to primary productivity of between 1.5 x 10(-4) to 23.4g Cm-2 yr(-1) (blue whales), 1.4x 10(-4) to 13.9 gC m(-2) yr(-1) (fin whales), and 2.4x 10(-5) to 1.7 g Cm-2 yr(-1) (humpback whales). However, only when all parameter estimates are at their upper limits does there appear to be this significant role for whales in enhancing primary productivity, and thus we need to assess the likelihood of these values arising. The high degree of uncertainty around the magnitude of these increases in primary productivity is mainly due to our limited quantitative understanding of key biogeochemical processes. To reduce uncertainty regarding the effect of whales on Southern Ocean primary productivity, future research will need to refine our understanding of five influential model parameters: iron content in krill; krill consumption rates by whales; persistence of whale faecal iron in the photic zone; bioavailability of this retained iron; and the carbon-to-iron ratio of phytoplankton.

Since this index oscillates from low values directly after moult to highest values prior to moult in constantly feeding shrimp, the lowest observed pre-moult condition followed by a moult was introduced as a reference value to separate growing and starving individuals in field data. Experiments with Crangon crangon confirmed that (1) post-moult condition varies in a narrow physiologically optimal range, regardless of recent growth increments, and (2) dry weight condition prior to moult is closely related to the subsequent length increment. The method was applied to estimate growth increments from in situ dry weight condition data of C. crangon. The new method can easily be applied to other related species, since the required data can be obtained from very simple short-term experiments.

Intrinsic and extrinsic forcing in life histories: patterns of growth and stable isotopes in male Antarctic fur seal teeth	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												Life-time records of the trophic sources of carbon, nitrogen and of growth rate can be generated from biogenic structures that show accretionary growth, including fish scales, whale baleen and the teeth of some animals. Records generated from individual teeth can also be combined to provide longer time series elucidating changes in environmental conditions encountered by a population. Both intrinsic (i.e. ontogenetic) and extrinsic (i.e. environmental) factors are important in modulating variation in growth and the apparent dietary sources of C and N. We used the canine teeth of a large marine predator, the male Antarctic fur seal Arctocephalus gazella from South Georgia, to investigate both intrinsic and extrinsic sources of variation. Substantial ontogenetic shifts occurred in both delta C-13 and delta N-15 values in individual teeth, indicating a change in the trophic sources of C and N as individual animals age. Over the 40 yr period from 1964 to 2005, and after statistical reduction of ontogenetic variation, we also detected long-term declines in delta C-13 and delta N-15 values, indicating that the population has become more dependent on energy from a lower trophic level. A concurrent decline in annular tooth growth may be a consequence of rapid population growth during this period. The time series of delta C-13 values was also inversely correlated with sea surface temperatures in the region, although isolating a causal relationship remains elusive. Our analyses suggest that both intrinsic and extrinsic sources of variation, and their interaction, must be considered from Such time series data; failure to do so could result in a biased interpretation.

Surface and near surface potential TS properties indicated the presence of three water types: a near-shore group of stations characterised by water which became progressively warmer and fresher closer to South Georgia, an offshore grouping in which sea surface temperatures and those at the winter water level were relatively warm (1.8degreesC and 0.5degreesC, respectively), and a third in which surface and winter water temperatures were cooler and reflected the presence of the SACCF. The transect bisected the SACCF twice, revealing that it was flowing in opposite directions, north-westward closest to South Georgia and south-eastwards at its furthest point from the island. The innermost limb was a narrow intense feature located just off the shelf break in 2000-3500m of water and in which rapid surface baroclinic velocities (up to 35cm s(-1)) were encountered. Offshore in the outermost limb, shown subsequently to be a mesoscale eddy that had meandered south from the retroflected limb of the SACCF, flow was broader and slower with peak velocities around 20cm s(-1). Chlorophyll a biomass was generally low (< 1 mg m(-3)) over much of the transect but increased dramatically in the region of the innermost limb of the SACCF, where a deepening of the surface mixed layer was coincident with a subsurface chlorophyll maximum (7.4 mg m(-3)) and elevated concentrations down to 100m. The bloom was coincident with depleted nutrient concentrations, particularly silicate, nitrate and phosphate, and although ammonium concentrations were locally depleted the bloom lay within an elevated band (up to 1.5 mmol m(-3)) associated with the frontal jet. Increased zooplankton abundance, higher copepod body carbon mass and egg production rates all showed a strong spatial integrity with the front. The population structure of the copepods Calanoides acutus and Rhincalanus gigas at stations within the front suggested that rather than simply resulting from entrainment and concentration within the jet, increased copepod abundance was the result of development in situ. Estimates of bloom duration, based on silicate and carbon budget calculations, set the likely duration between 82 and 122d, a figure supported by the development schedule of the two copepod species. Given this timescale, model outputs from FRAM and OCCAM indicated that particles that occurred on the north side of South Georgia in December would have been in the central-southern Scotia Sea 2-3 months earlier, probably in sea ice affected regions.

J	ODonovan, V; Tully, O				ODonovan, V; Tully, O			Lipofuscin (age pigment) as an index of crustacean age: Correlation with age, temperature and body size in cultured juvenile Homarus gammarus L.	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY												Morphological lipofuscin was quantified in laboratory cultured Homarus gammarus to determine if the amount of pigment was correlated with age and culture temperature in this species. Two cohorts were monitored for 34 and 18 months, respectively. An age dependent accumulation of lipofuscin concentration (expressed as % area fraction) occurred (Y = -2.22 + 0.084X, R(2) = 46.8%, p less than or equal to 0.0001 and incorporating carapace length as a covariate). Carapace length accounted for 3.3% of the variation in lipofuscin. The effect of temperature on lipofuscin accumulation was assessed using three regimes: 8, 11 and 13.5 +/- 5 degrees C. Temperature had a significant effect on lipofuscin accumulation (F = 15.9, p less than or equal to 0.0009). Carapace length also responded significantly to temperature although the trend was nor linear (F = 68.1, p < 0.0001). There was no significant correlation between lipofuscin concentration and body size in lobsters of the same age (r = 0.067, -0.2, 0.154 and 0.5 for each of four groups). The age dependent increase in morphological lipofuscin and the lack of correlation between body size and lipofuscin in cultured H. gammarus indicates significant potential for this technique as a method of ageing lobsters. As lipofuscin accumulation is a function of metabolic age, factors other than temperature, such as population density, which affects growth rate in the wild, could potentially affect metabolic rate and therefore lipofuscin accumulation. However the independence between growth and lipofuscin in laboratory animals indicates that this may not be a problem.																	0022-0981					DEC 15	1996	207	1-2					1	14		10.1016/S0022-0981(96)02662-7							WOS:A1996VZ49600001

Timing of ovarian maturation, the percent of the population reproducing, and individual reproductive output (batch volume, embryo diameter) were measured. Indices have been developed to quantify the timing and intensity of reproduction in Antarctic krill. One finding important to estimates of population fecundity for this long-lived species is that the percent of the population reproducing can vary widely, from 10 to 98%. Each season was characterized as having delayed, average or advanced ovarian development. In this study we relate these indices to direct and indirect indicators of spring or annual food availability. The timing of the spring sea ice retreat and the extent of sea ice in the spring (September through November) appear to significantly affect the intensity and timing of reproduction in the population. Intensity of reproduction was highest under "average" conditions, and oocyte development fastest with conditions of a late retreat and high spring sea ice extent.																	0003-1569					FEB	2001	41	1					74	89		10.1668/0003-1569(2001)041[0074:EVAIIO]2.0.CO;2							WOS:000172505600007

Shifts in historical fishing grounds and spatial distribution of catches have occurred as a result of recent changes in fishery practices. To understand these shifts, fishery spatial dynamics and fishing fleet behavior evaluated on different spatial and temporal scales are critical. We examine the catch distribution on three spatial-temporal scales. At the Western Antarctic Peninsula (WAP) scale, we assessed the fleet's southward expansion, identifying the Bransfield Strait (BS) as the main current fishing ground, replacing the historical Drake sector. At the BS scale, we identified fishing hotspots (FHs) that concentrated 48%-57% of the total catch over a period of 2-6 months and had high catch densities (2.2-30.3 ton km(-2)). At the FH scale, we tracked the spatial distribution of the fleet within FHs, demonstrating a shift of fishing vessels to contiguous zones as a result of a decrease in daily catch rates (CPUE). Such shifts (allowing the fleet to increase CPUE) occurred every 4-17 days. Previously exploited fishing grounds were revisited based on FH persistence and sea ice conditions. This paper concludes with a discussion of the potential impact of fishing fleet behavior and catch concentration, considering the recent spatial shift towards less-exploited areas, the overlap with critical zones for predator feeding, and several implications for fisheries management.

Krill Excretion Boosts Microbial Activity in the Southern Ocean	PLOS ONE												Antarctic krill are known to release large amounts of inorganic and organic nutrients to the water column. Here we test the role of krill excretion of dissolved products in stimulating heterotrophic bacteria on the basis of three experiments where ammonium and organic excretory products released by krill were added to bacterial assemblages, free of grazers. Our results demonstrate that the addition of krill excretion products (but not of ammonium alone), at levels expected in krill swarms, greatly stimulates bacteria resulting in an order-of-magnitude increase in growth and production. Furthermore, they suggest that bacterial growth rate in the Southern Ocean is suppressed well below their potential by resource limitation. Enhanced bacterial activity in the presence of krill, which are major sources of DOC in the Southern Ocean, would further increase recycling processes associated with krill activity, resulting in highly efficient krill-bacterial recycling that should be conducive to stimulating periods of high primary productivity in the Southern Ocean.

We investigated the effects of Zn2+ on Exopalaemon carinicauda arginine kinase (ECAK). Zn2+ conspicuously inactivated the activity of ECAK (IC50 = 8.49 +/- 0.76 mu M), and the double-reciprocal kinetics indicated that Zn2+ induced non-competitive inhibition of arginine and ATP. Spectrofluorometry results showed that Zn2+ induced tertiary structure changes in ECAK with the exposure of hydrophobic surfaces that directly induced ECAK aggregation. The addition of osmolytes, such as glycine and proline, successfully blocked the ECAK aggregation and restored the conformation and activity of ECAK. We measured the ORF gene sequence of ECAK using RACE and built a 3D structure of ECAK using homology models. Additionally, molecular dynamics (MD) and docking simulations between ECAK and Zn2+ have been conducted. The simulation results showed that Zn2+ blocked the entrance of ATP to the active site, and this result is consistent with.the experimental result showing Zn2+-induced inactivation of ECAK. Our study demonstrates the effect of Zn2+ on ECAK enzymatic function and unfolding, including aggregation, and the protective effects of osmolytes on ECAK folding. This study might provide important insights into the AK metabolic enzyme of invertebrates in marine environments. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Reid, K; Trathan, PN; Croxall, JP; Hill, HJ				Reid, K; Trathan, PN; Croxall, JP; Hill, HJ			Krill caught by predators and nets: Differences between species and techniques	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												Samples of Antarctic krill collected from 6 seabird species and Antarctic fur seal during February 1986 at South Georgia were compared to krill from scientific nets fished in the area at the same time. The length-frequency distribution of krill was broadly similar between predators and nets although the krill taken by diving species formed a homogeneous group which showed significant differences from krill taken by other predators and by nets. There were significant differences in the maturity/sex stage composition between nets and predators; in particular all predator species showed a consistent sex bias towards female krill. Similarities in the krill taken by macaroni (offshore feeding) and gentoo (inshore feeding) penguins and differences between krill taken by penguins and albatrosses suggest that foraging techniques were more important than foraging location in influencing the type of krill in predator diets. Most krill taken by predators were adult; most female krill were sexually active (particularly when allowance is made for misclassification bias arising from predator digestion). Because female krill are larger, and probably less maneuverable, than males, the biased sex ratio in predator diets at this time of year may reflect some combination of selectivity by predators and superior escape responses of male krill. Overall, adult, sexually active female krill, forming 40% by number of the local krill population, may comprise 60 to 70% by number and 75 to 88% by mass of the krill taken by their main seabird and seal predators at South Georgia al the time of peak local demand in February.																	0171-8630					SEP	1996	140	1-3					13	20		10.3354/meps140013							WOS:A1996VJ37700002

We aimed to test whether static no-take zones within a large, sustainable-use MPA prevented overlap between gentoo penguins and a krill fishery during two winters with contrasting prey fields. LOCATION: South Georgia, Southwest Atlantic Ocean. METHOD: We used satellite tracking (N = 16, June-September 2018) to describe gentoo penguin movements and distribution and quantified their overlap with the MPA's no-take zone (NTZ) and the krill fishing grounds. DNA metabarcoding of scats (N = 220, April-September 2018) was used to quantify diet. RESULTS: When krill were at moderate densities and evenly distributed in 2001, gentoo penguins would have spent all of their time within the 12 NM NTZ, but when availability was low in 2018, they spent 46.3% of their time outside the NTZ and 9.6% within the krill fishing grounds. The extension of the NTZ to 30 km in response to this finding would have produced a 14.9% increase in protection for penguins and displaced 4% of fishery hauls. Gentoo penguin diet comprised 25.8% krill, which is lower than in the late 1980s but more than in 2009. MAIN CONCLUSIONS: Gentoo penguins extend their foraging range when krill is scarce, which increases the potential for spatial overlap with the krill fishery during periods of nutritional stress. Current regulations allow for expansion of both extent and catches by the krill fishery and, should this occur, gentoo penguins may face heightened risks from competition. A dynamic ocean management framework, that extends closed areas in response to near real-time data on penguin movements and krill density estimates, may reduce the potential for competition in this sustainable-use MPA while allowing a profitable krill fishery.

J	Gillund, F; Myhr, AI				Gillund, Froydis; Myhr, Anne Ingeborg			Perspectives on Salmon Feed: A Deliberative Assessment of Several Alternative Feed Resources	JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL & ENVIRONMENTAL ETHICS												The future of salmon aquaculture depends on the adoption of alternative feed resources in order to reduce the need for fish meal and fish oil. This may include resources such as species from lower trophic levels, by-products and by-catch from fisheries and aquaculture, animal by-products, plants, genetically modified (GM) plants, nutritionally enhanced GM plants and products from microorganisms and GM microorganisms. Here, we report on a deliberative assessment of these alternative feed resources, involving 18 participants from different interest groups within Norwegian salmon aquaculture. The participants defined a broad range of appraisal criteria concerning health and welfare issues, economical issues, environmental issues, and knowledge and social issues. A number of uncertainties, in the form of incomplete knowledge, diverging opinions, and context specific factors were identified when the participants evaluated the alternatives. Our findings support the need for more research on the suitability of alternative feed resources for farmed salmon. Additionally, the study underlines the importance of facilitating deliberative assessments in order to map the plurality of perspectives and explore qualitative aspects of uncertainty. Such initiatives improve the information base upon which decisions on future feed resources for farmed salmon are made.

Previous experimental studies of P. robustoides, O. crassus and D. haemobaphes indicated that the salinity optimum for the species is about 7 PSU. We examined whether salinities below 5 PSU in the Vistula estuary - the Vistula Lagoon and the Vistula Delta, create a favorable environment and have a positive effect on Ponto-Caspian gammarids. The objective of this work was to determine the population parameters (size structure) and biological indicators (condition) of the studied gammarid species at a low salinity level. Length-weight relationships can be considered as their body condition in the environment. These relationships were calculated for each gammarid species according to the exponential equation y = ax(b), where: y - wet weight, x - total length, a - intercept, b - slope. The results clearly show responses of Ponto-Caspian gammarids to the low salinity habitat and indicate that such environment provides excellent conditions. The results of analysis show that the condition of gammarids is good. The optimal strategy of the examined alien gammarids may help them to maintain a strong competitive position in the environment and affect the colonization process in non-native waters with low salinity.

Samples were taken from the water column, the ice. In water interface and the sea ice. In winter (August 1986) S. longipes copepodite stage ClV occurred mainly in the upper water layers of the ice covered eastern Weddell Sea, while only naupliiwere found in the sea ice. In late winter/early spring (October-December 1986) very low numbers of S. longipes were found in the water column, mainly in the upper 50m, but high numbers occurred immediately below and within the sea ice. Adults dominated in the water column and in the under ice water layer while the sea ice contained nauplii and copepodite stage CI. During summer (January/February 1985) the eastern Weddell Sea was almost entirely free of ice with the exception of fast ice fields at the ice shelf. During this time S. longipes was concentrated in the upper 50m of the water column and in the ice/water interface where an ice cover was present. Young copepodite stages (CI-CIII) comprised the largest fraction of the population. In autumn (April/May 1992) as new ice began to develop, S. longipes, dominated by copepodite stage CIV, occurred in greatest number within mid-water layers. The abundance of S. longipes in autumn was similar to late winter/early spring highest in the sea ice and lowest in the water column. During all periods of investigation the population structure differed between the various habitats with the youngest population occurring in the sea ice and the oldest in the water column. A younger generation of the S. longipes population appears to overwinter in the sea ice and ice/water interface and an older one in deeper water layers or near the bottom.

Use of the Southern Ocean by breeding Short-tailed shearwaters (Puffinus tenuirostris)	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY												During the breeding season, seabirds act as central place foragers, constrained to foraging locations nearer to the breeding colony. Variability in energetic demands during phases of the breeding period has the capacity to shape foraging behaviour and influence at-sea foraging behaviour of seabirds due to the changing requirements of the young. Short-tailed shearwaters (Puffinus tenuirostris) (STSH) are a migratory species that migrates between foraging grounds in the northern Pacific Ocean and breeding colonies in south-east Australia. They are known to traverse large sectors of the Southern Ocean to find prey; however the at-sea foraging locations of this species are not spatially and temporally well defined during the breeding season, when energetic requirements are at their peak. We aimed to define key foraging areas of STSH over the pre-laying, incubation and chick-rearing phases of the breeding cycle and identify associations with broad scale oceanographic features. Using lightlevel geolocation archival tag technology, 27 adults from a southern Tasmanian colony were tracked from their arrival in October to March (2010-2011), providing information on a total of 77 pre-laying exodus, incubation and chick-rearing flights throughout the Southern Ocean. During the pre-laying exodus and incubation phases, the birds visited waters of the sub-Antarctic Front and Polar Frontal Zone. After hatching, the birds made direct flights to the Marginal Ice Zone between 155E and 90 E. The Antarctic pack ice is a key nursery ground for Antarctic krill (Euphasia superba) over the winter months, and as the ice retreats they become more accessible to STSH when energetic demands, due to chick provisioning, are at their greatest. During late chick-rearing, the birds used waters in the region of the Antarctic Divergence. A foraging index created from activity data collected by the tags indicated that adults spent the greatest amount of time foraging at the furthest extent of each trip. This study has shown that STSH alter their foraging movements over the course of the breeding season, using areas that are likely to provide predictable food resources. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

J	Mori, Y; Boyd, IL				Mori, Y; Boyd, IL			The behavioral basis for nonlinear functional responses and optimal foraging in antarctic fur seals	ECOLOGY												This study investigated the degree to which the behavior of a predator in the marine environment can be used to indicate the availability of prey. It examined this in Antarctic fur seals (Arctocephalus gazella) feeding on krill, with a view to understanding how behavioral choices could lead to a nonlinear functional response. The study showed how fur seals adjusted their time budgets to maximize the mean rate of energy intake in response to varying prey abundance. The behavioral indicator of prey abundance was the amount of time spent by fur seals at the bottom of dives after adjustment for dive depth. This indicator was well correlated with independent measures of prey abundance. The indicator was calibrated in terms of net rate of energy intake from information about energy expenditures in Antarctic fur seals and was used within the framework of optimal foraging theory to examine how female fur seals organized their foraging activity within and between bouts. Foraging in Antarctic fur seals conformed to many of the predictions from energy rate-maximizing behavior. For example, the apparent net rate of energy intake by fur seals declined with time spent in a patch, and the rate of energy intake on leaving a patch declined as apparent food availability in the environment declined. In addition, the time spent in patches increased as apparent food availability declined. Antarctic fur seals were able to adjust their behavior to track highly variable prey distributions and densities. The simple decision about when to leave a patch in relation to current environmental prey availability appears to be responsible for allowing fur seals to maintain saturation of the foraging rate as food density declines.																	0012-9658	1939-9170				FEB	2004	85	2					398	410		10.1890/03-4005							WOS:000220108700011

Swarms occurred in association with mussels, clams and tubeworms, and were located above, and immediately downstream of cracks with emanating hydrothermal water. Numerical density sometimes exceeded 1000 individuals l-1, which is 3 orders of magnitude greater than and previous report on pelagic crustaceans from the deep sea. The amphipods, however, were not obligatory swarmers, and thin-layered shoals and scattered individuals were observed. Orientation of individuals was often polarized as they headed into the venting flow, swimming vigorously at 5-10 cm s-1 to maintain their position in the current. Retention within the preferred habitat requires an average swimming speed corresponding to the average current speed, suggesting a sustained swimming of >10 body lengths s-1. These observations contrast with the general concept of low swimming activity in deep-sea crustaceans.

J	Willis, J				Willis, Jay			Whales maintained a high abundance of krill; both are ecosystem engineers in the Southern Ocean	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												Krill abundance was predicted to rise after the end of commercial whaling in the Southern Ocean due to the release of predatory pressure from 2 million whales that were killed between 1915 and 1970, but contrary to expectations, there has been a substantial decline in abundance of krill since the end of whaling. I presented a model 7 yr ago which explained how krill behaviour, in response to the threat of predation by whales, may provide an answer to this paradox. The original model contained a speculative link: a mechanism by which krill could detect the presence of whales over a wide area, and therefore could behave in response to a credible threat. Recently, iron has been implicated in a positive feedback cycle between whales, krill and primary production. The cycle depends on the buoyant faeces of whales fertilising surface layers. This is both a plausible way for krill to detect whales over a wide area and an explanation for enhanced feeding at the surface, but this was not incorporated in the original model. Thus, nutrient retention and behavioural control are probably an example of niche construction and ecosystem engineering by both krill and whales. In this paper I revisit and update the simple model of krill mentioned above. The model is calibrated against known system states and is used to imply the ecosystem level changes caused by commercial whaling. This improved model may explain the reduction in krill abundance after the end of commercial whaling. Untested hypotheses which can be falsified in designed experiments are listed.

J	Nevitt, GA; Bergstrom, DM; Bonadonna, F				Nevitt, Gabrielle A.; Bergstrom, Dana M.; Bonadonna, Francesco			The potential role of ammonia as a signal molecule for procellarifform seabirds	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												Procellariiform seabirds (petrels, albatrosses and shearwaters) navigate vast distances over seemingly featureless ocean habitat by mechanisms that are not well understood. These birds have large olfactory bulbs, and the use of smell has been implicated in both foraging and homing behavior. While many olfactory cues relevant to these behaviors have been identified, ammonia is a potentially significant, biogenic, scented compound that has not been studied in this context. Ammonium (NH4+) constitutes a primary waste product produced by many of the prey species on which procellariiforms forage. Nitrogen waste products, including volatilized ammonia (NH3) also scent the terrestrial landscape of sub-Antarctic islands where newly breeding procellariiform seabirds recruit and raise their young. Since an ability to smell ammonia may be relevant to both prey detection and locating colonies or islands, we used a non-invasive, behavioral assay to examine whether this scented compound is detectable by a candidate test species, the blue petrel Halobaena caerulea Gmelin. Our results suggest that these birds can detect volatilized ammonia within a concentration range that they may naturally encounter (10(-11) to 10(-5) M), and point to ammonia as a potential signal molecule in the sub-Antarctic.

Blue whales Balaenoptera musculus rely mostly on stored energy reserves for reproduction. They feed almost exclusively on krill, which vary in density and abundance both spatially and temporally. We used 10 depth-velocity archival tags deployed on blue whales foraging in the St. Lawrence Estuary, Canada, to identify feeding events. We modeled krill densities required to equal or exceed energy expenditures and allow energy storage. During the daytime, blue whales generally dove deeper and performed fewer but longer feeding dives than at other times of the diel cycle (10 vs. 28 feeding dives h(-1)); however, they performed more lunges per dive during daytime (3 vs. 1 lunge dive(-1)), which resulted in a stable feeding rate around the clock. Only 11.7 and 5.5 % of the Arctic and northern krill patches measured in situ contained densities allowing blue whales to achieve neutral energetic balance (FE = 1); less than 1.5 % of patches allowed FE of >= 3. While FE leading to successful reproduction and adequate fitness is unknown, these results underscore the necessity for blue whales to seek the highest densities within patches to reach neutral balance or allow energy storage. These findings further our understanding of blue whale foraging ecology and habitat suitability, and may help predict the effects of climate and natural variability or of potential fisheries on krill densities and blue whale condition.

Extreme diel variation in the feeding behavior of humpback whales along the western Antarctic Peninsula during autumn	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												Most humpback whale Megaptera novaeangliae populations partition their time between prey-rich feeding and prey-deficient breeding/calving regions. How these whales feed and optimize the consumption of prey resources prior to long-distance migrations and fasting is largely unknown. We deployed multi-sensor tags on humpback whales around the western Antarctic Peninsula to describe their daily activity patterns late in the feeding season to test the hypothesis that feeding behavior varies over the diel cycle so as to maximize energy intake and limit energy expenditure. Dives were assigned to a behavioral state (feeding, resting, traveling, exploring) to determine hourly rates and to build an ethogram of activity patterns. Our results show a distinct diel pattern of whales feeding exclusively at night. Feeding depth was deeper around sunrise/sunset and shallower (similar to 50 m) at night, consistent with diel vertical prey movement. Shallow feeding dives typically contained a single feeding lunge, a strategy known to increase feeding efficiency and maximize intake rates by maintaining proximity to the surface and reducing the energetic costs of deep diving. The lack of feeding during daytime may indicate prey being too deep for efficient foraging. Our results add information where currently there is a paucity of data describing how baleen whales optimize feeding behavior, specifically in relation to prey distribution and movement, to fuel their extraordinary energetic requirements necessary for growth, migration, and reproduction. Understanding behavioral patterns and predator/prey dynamics in rapidly changing marine environments, like the Antarctic Peninsula, is critical for understanding how these changes will affect ecosystem structure and function.

In this study, we investigated the resource utilization of Euphausia pacifica within the epipelagic zone (0-200 m depth) in the East Sea (Japan Sea) during spring bloom, using stable isotope analysis. The C-13 and N-15 values of pico- to micro-particulate organic matters (POMs) from the surface to 200-m depth layers were significantly different. The C-13 and N-15 values of E. pacifica adults showed significant differences between sexes. Stable isotope analysis showed that E. pacifica females fed mainly on the surface layer POM, whereas the males fed primarily in the deeper layers, since the contributions of POMs in the 100-m and 200-m depth layers to their diets were relatively high. We suggest that high primary productivity in the surface layer in spring and the sinking particles derived from it may provide sufficient energy for the reproduction of E. pacifica females and male development, respectively.

During the first few weeks of March the seals were moving in the pack ice along the continental shelf edge, close to the coast of Queen Maud Land. In April and May, when the pack ice extended northwards, most of the seals moved north, one reaching 63 degrees S in late May. In the first half of June the two remaining seals turned south and moved back deep into the pack ice. The seals made about 150 dives per day each throughout the study period. Ninety percent of these were made to depths of less than 52 m. Individual maximum diving depths varied between 288 and 528 m. In March the seals were most active at night, when the dive depth was shallower than during the day. In April and May the seals were more active during day-time, with an absence of any diurnal change in diving depth. These results support the notion that crabeater seals predominantly feed on krill in Antarctic pack ice, even when winter returns to the waters off Queen Maud Land.																	0722-4060					APR	1995	15	4					261	268									WOS:A1995QV57000004

BRITISH JOURNAL OF NUTRITION												There is an urgent need to find alternative feed resources that can further substitute fishmeal in Atlantic salmon diets without compromising health and food quality, in particular during the finishing feeding period when the feed demand is highest and flesh quality effects are most significant. This study investigates efficacy of substituting a isoprotein (35 %) and isolipid (35 %) low fishmeal diet (FM, 15 %) with Antarctic krill meal (KM, 12 %) during 3 months with growing finishing 2 center dot 3 kg salmon (quadruplicate sea cages/diet). Final body weight (3 center dot 9 (se0 center dot 04) kg) was similar in the dietary groups, but the KM group had more voluminous body shape, leaner hearts and improved fillet integrity, firmness and colour. Ectopic epithelial cells and focal Ca deposits in intestine were only detected in the FM group. Transcriptome profiling by microarray of livers showed dietary effects on several immune genes, and a panel of structural genes were up-regulated in the KM group, including cadherin and connexin. Up-regulation of genes encoding myosin heavy chain proteins was the main finding in skeletal muscle. Morphology examination by scanning electron microscopy and secondary structure by Fourier transform IR spectroscopy revealed more ordered and stable collagen architecture of the KM group. NEFA composition of skeletal muscle indicated altered metabolism ofn-3,n-6 and SFA of the KM group. The results demonstrated that improved health and meat quality in Atlantic salmon fed krill meal were associated with up-regulation of immune genes, proteins defining muscle properties and genes involved in cell contacts and adhesion, altered fatty acid metabolism and fat deposition, and improved gut health and collagen structure.

J	Rogers, AD; Clarke, A; Peck, LS				Rogers, AD; Clarke, A; Peck, LS			Population genetics of the Antarctic heteronemertean Parbolasia corrugatus from the South Orkney Islands	MARINE BIOLOGY												An allozyme survey, using starch-gel electrophoresis, was carried out on eight populations of the Antarctic nemertean worm Parborlasia corrugatus (McIntosh, 1876) collected from locations around the South Orkney Islands, Antarctica. These populations were separated by distances in the order of tens of kilometres. Genetic variation was estimated over 22 enzyme loci for all populations examined, giving an observed heterozygosity of 0.142. This was much lower than the expected heterozygosity (H-e = 0.201), and it was found that there was a significant deficiency of heterozygotes across four enzyme loci (p less than or equal to 0.01). A more detailed examination of this deficiency of heterozygotes was undertaken for the six populations and six variable enzyme loci for which the most complete data sets existed. A significant deficiency of heterozygotes was found at the enzyme locus Odh-1 for four of the six populations examined (p less than or equal to 0.01). Mean F-is (0.240) indicated a significant (p less than or equal to 0.01) within-population component of the heterozygote deficiency estimated for the six populations sampled, and this was mainly due to the Ap-1, Odh-1 and Pgm-1 loci. The mean F-st value (0.036) was also significant (p less than or equal to 0.01), indicating a degree of genetic differentiation between populations. The observed levels of genetic differentiation between populations of P. corrugatus and the significant heterozygote deficiencies were unexpected, because this species has been reported to have a long-lived planktotrophic larva. It is hypothesised that recruitment of P. corrugatus in the South Orkney Islands originates from genetically distinct populations located in the Weddell Sea and to the west of the Antarctic Peninsula. Shifts in the relative position of the Weddell Sea Front, Weddell-Scotia Confluence and Scotia Front, relative to the South Orkney Islands, provide a mechanism for variation in the origin of recruits over time.																	0025-3162					APR	1998	131	1					1	13		10.1007/s002270050290							WOS:000073613500001

They have proven to be a valuable method of defining food web relationships, trophic positioning, and the dietary behaviors of marine species. The endemic krill species of the Humboldt Current System (HCS), Euphausia mucronata, is the most abundant krill species over the continental shelf, usually associated with coastal upwelling zones. This study aimed to quantify the changes in the FA composition of E. mucronata in the coastal upwelling zone off Dichato in central Chile concerning the phytoplankton community and environmental variability. We hypothesized that E. mucronata changes its FA composition according to the functional species groups that structure the phytoplankton community as well as environmental variability. Krill, phytoplankton, and environmental datasets were analyzed using multivariate analyses, considering samplings from January 2013 to August 2014. The total concentration of FAs was 550.5 ng/g (n = 42) of which the 77% corresponded to six FAs: palmitoleic acid (16:1n7), palmitic acid (16:0), vaccenic acid (18:1), oleic acid (18:1n7), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA, 20:5n3) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, 22:6n3). FA composition did not change according to neither the season nor sampling date. Seasonal changes were observed in both community structure of the phytoplankton (i.e. species composition and functional groups) and sea temperature. EPA/DHA ratio, PUFA/SFA ratio and carnivory variability were seasonally different suggesting that E. mucronata had mostly a diatom-based herbivorous habit during austral spring and summer and, it could have omnivore or carnivore habits during austral autumn and winter. Diatom and ciliate abundances and, sea temperature were the best predictor variables explaining 64% of the total variation in the FA composition. This study suggests that, despite seasonal environmental variation (biotic and abiotic), this krill species fed mainly diatoms and could shift its trophic habit to carnivory according to season of the year.

The effects of KO intake on plasma cholesterol and glucose levels in Wistar rats fed a high-cholesterol diet (HCD) were investigated. ResultsWKO contained 37.63% triglycerides, 48.37% phospholipids, 13.54% free fatty acids and 0.66% cholesterol, whereas the corresponding values for PKO were 0.59, 69.80, 28.53 and 1.09% respectively. Meanwhile, PKO contained much more polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA, 37.76%) than WKO (28.36%). After 4weeks of HCD consumption, plasma levels of total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and glucose increased significantly, but that of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) decreased significantly. The intake of PKO and WKO for 4weeks caused a significant reduction in body weight gain and plasma levels of TC and LDL-C in HCD-fed rats. Compared with WKO, PKO was more effective in decreasing plasma TC and LDL-C levels. ConclusionPKO showed better overall cholesterol-lowering effects than WKO, which may be due to its higher n-3 PUFA levels.

J	Amos, AF				Amos, AF			A decade of oceanographic variability in summertime near Elephant Island, Antarctica	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS												The oceanography of near-surface (to 750 m) summertime waters surrounding the Elephant Island area of the South Shetland Islands has been surveyed each year from 1990 to 1999 as part of the U.S. Antarctic Marine Living Resources (AMLR) program. Using data from a grid of conductivity-temperature-depth stations occupied twice each summer and surface meteorological data collected continuously in the survey area, the mean (and annual departures from the mean) hydrography, circulation, and overlying wind field have been determined. The area is an important krill fishing ground and includes several water mass zones and a major frontal boundary. Differences between middle and late summer ("seasonal") conditions and interannual variability have been investigated. The mean summer condition is quite representative of conditions encountered in each of the 10 years, and little change occurs from middle to late summer, other than a warming of Antarctic Surface Water, including the Winter Water temperature minimum at 100 m, but there is no discernible trend from middle to late summer at the depth of the Circumpolar Deep Water. Interannual variability of sea temperature, winds, and sea level pressure as measured during these surveys showed no correlation with a sea ice index and a recently devised pressure index, the Drake Passage Oscillation Index (DPOI) [Naganobu et al., 1999], despite the correlations found in that study between AMLR chlorophyll a and krill recruitment indices, sea ice, and the DPOI. No correlation was found between DPOI and annual summertime sea temperature, wind, and surface pressure anomalies in the survey area. The implication is that global-scale climatic oscillations with periodicities measured in years may not be adequately detected by small-scale oceanographic surveys even though the surveys may extend over several years unless the surveys are specifically designed for that purpose.																	2169-9275	2169-9291				OCT 15	2001	106	C10					22401	22423		10.1029/2000JC000315							WOS:000171468300021

Recently evidence emerged that free-drifting icebergs were hotspots of biogeochemical and ecological activity. They also represent physical habitat structure both above and below the sea surface. Here we found seabird abundances that were 2 to 6 times greater within about one-half km of free drifting icebergs than the area between about one-half and one km from the iceberg edge. Aggregation was measured by surveys with an experimental design for determining potential local impacts of free-drifting icebergs on seabird density. Seabird surveys were conducted during three cruises in the Weddell Sea from 4 to 20 December 2005, 11 to 25 June 2008, and 21 March to 2 April 2009. Visual surveys were done on the vessel bridge typically for periods of five minutes facing the port or starboard side. Differences in species composition were also linked to distance from the iceberg edge for the most sampled icebergs with Daption capense exhibiting change in relative abundance. On a local scale, environmental factors such as surface productivity, air temperature, and winds were not consistently related to seabird distributions and community dynamics. The results suggest that climatically-driven variations in iceberg abundance would influence local seabird distributions with unknown impacts on regional abundances and species composition.

The biomass of the large euphausiid Antarctic krill may range from ca. 2 to 150 g fresh mass (FM) m(-2). When krill biomass is low, copepod biomass may be correspondingly higher and overall zooplankton biomass remains more or less unchanged. Krill are omnivorous, feeding facultatively either as grazers on microplankton or as predators on smaller zooplankton. This leads to complex feedbacks within the plankton. A simple model of the phytoplankton-copepod-krill system is used to simulate two scenarios of zooplankton composition. For the "low krill-high copepod'' scenario, the model predicts higher phytoplankton biomass and production, lower mixed layer (ML) ammonium, nitrate and silicate concentrations, and higher detrital carbon production than in the "high krill-low copepod'' scenario. Nitrogen cycling provides the most explicit demonstration of the differences between the scenarios. For the "low krill-high copepod'' scenario, ML ammonium concentration decreased by 25% over 20 days, but excretion by metazooplankton supplied 30% of phytoplankton nitrogen demand. In the "high krill-low copepod'' scenario, ML ammonium only declined by 10% over 20 days, but metazooplankton excretion was much lower, at 10% of phytoplankton N demand. These predictions are compared with data from several surveys covering krill biomass in the range 10-55 g FM m(-2). Phytoplankton chlorophyll biomass is negatively related to krill biomass, and ML nutrients are positively correlated with krill biomass in these data. Both observations and model results suggest that variation in biogeochemical carbon and nitrogen cycles in the South Georgia pelagic ecosystem is determined largely by changes in zooplankton community composition and its impact on phytoplankton dynamics.

Sea-ice cover differed markedly between years, with apparent effects on cetacean distribution. No ice was present until late June in 2001, while the previous winter sea ice never fully retreated (> 30% cover) during the 2002 or 2003 summer, thus increasing the proportion of thicker and more complex ice, including multi-year floes. Humpback (237 sightings; 537 individuals) and minke (103 sightings: 267 individuals) whales were the most commonly detected species. Data from seven comparable cruises were used to identify habitat for minke and humpback whales over five geographically distinct spatial divisions in the study area. In all years, both species were predominantly found in near coastal habitat, particularly in the fjords where complex habitat likely concentrated prey. In 2002 and 2003 the presence of sea ice provided additional feeding habitat, and the numbers of minkes (in winter) and humpbacks (late summer and autumn) in the area doubled compared with 2001. Humpbacks in particular were concentrated at the ice boundaries during late summer and autumn, while minke numbers increased in the winter that followed and occupied ice-covered areas along the entire shelf edge. Important resource sites for these species are mainly located in near-coastal areas and are used in all years, but when ice margins exist and intersect with resource sites they attract much larger numbers of animals due to the dynamics between sea ice and prey.

Here, we use the DEBkiss model to piece together the available data into a quantitative energy budget. We use this model to analyse larval growth curves, and to reconstruct the feeding history for field populations from their (reconstructed) multi-year growth patterns. The resulting model parameters are also used to provide estimates for respiration, feeding and reproduction rates that are consistent with measured values. Many uncertainties remain, but this analysis demonstrates how simple and generic energy-budget models have the potential to integrate observations on different traits, to interpret growth as a function of food and temperature, and to compare different species in a meaningful manner.

J	Thiebot, JB; Weimerskirch, H				Thiebot, Jean-Baptiste; Weimerskirch, Henri			Contrasted associations between seabirds and marine mammals across four biomes of the southern Indian Ocean	JOURNAL OF ORNITHOLOGY												Seabirds associations with marine mammals have been shown to be an efficient way by which the seabirds can detect and access prey patches. However, these associations have been documented locally in the literature and their relevance at the ecosystem level is unknown, mostly because they constitute relatively rare events and therefore few appropriate data exist. In this study, we aimed at quantifying and qualifying these interactions, based on long-term standardised at-sea observations carried out from 1978 to 2005 in the whole southern Indian Ocean. We(1) investigated whether the observed interspecific associations between foraging seabirds and marine mammals could be distinguished from chance using a bootstrap method, and(2) compared their occurrences between four oceanic biomes sampled(tropical, subtropical, subantarctic, Antarctic). Although in our data we could not discriminate active association versus aggregation of species feeding on the same prey patches, our results indicate that, in each biome, 5-10 seabird species were more frequently associated with marine mammals than expected due to chance. Tropical birds appeared to be associated almost exclusively with Delphinidae schools, whereas in the subtropical waters, all the significant associations occurred with marine mammals others than dolphins. In the subantarctic biome, seabirds were mostly associated with Pinnipeds, and the highly productive Antarctic waters provided opportunities for diverse but rare associations. This study suggests that the ecological links between foraging predators can be measured using a randomisation method, and provides conclusive and comparative information on the ecology of apex trophic levels organisms from pelagic communities.

J	Thiele, D; Chester, ET; Gill, PC				Thiele, D; Chester, ET; Gill, PC			Cetacean distribution off Eastern Antarctica (80-150 degrees E) during the Austral summer of 1995/1996	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY												A line-transect marine science survey of the waters off East Antarctica (80-150 degrees E; CCAMLR Division 58.4.1; IWC Areas IV and V) was conducted during the Austral summer of 1995/1996. A total of 350 h search effort resulted in 342 sightings (746 animals) of 12 identified species and eight categories of unidentified cetaceans. Humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) were the most frequently sighted species in terms of number of schools and number of individuals (82 sightings:159 animals). All humpback sightings were west of 120 degrees E; distributed over a wide latitudinal band from the ice edge out to the northern limit of the survey (63 degrees S); correlated with high integrated-Chi at > 50 mu m/m(2)); and generally concentrated in the waters to the south of the Antarctic Divergence and the Southern Boundary of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC). Baleen whale distribution reflected the overall patterns of biological productivity and oceanographic processes. Most animals were found to the west of 120 degrees E and to the south of the Southern Boundary of the ACC (which lies well offshore in this region) and the Antarctic Divergence, which coincided with the ACC between 85 and 135 degrees E on this survey. The large-scale patterns observed in this survey indicate that baleen whale species in the Southern Ocean may be concentrated in areas where extensive winter sea-ice cover and oceanographic features allow extended residence time in surface waters for primary producers during the Austral summer ice retreat. Odontocete species were less abundant and generally concentrated at meso-scale high-productivity areas produced by the interactions of identifiable physical features, (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

J	Calise, L; Knutsen, T				Calise, Lucio; Knutsen, Tor			Multifrequency target strength of northern krill (Meganyctiphanes norvegica) swimming horizontally	ICES JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE												Multifrequency acoustic measurements on ex situ horizontally swimming krill were made in a novel experimental setting. An ensemble of northern krill (Meganyctiphanes norvegica) was introduced to a large enclosure (a mesocosm), and acoustic backscatter was sampled using a multifrequency (70, 120, and 200 kHz) echosounder (Simrad EK60). Two submerged lamps were placed at opposite sides of the mesocosm and switched on and off to induce the krill, by light attraction, to swim horizontally through the acoustic beams. By tracking echoes, animal displacement, swimming speed, and target strength (TS) by frequency were estimated. The dominant and secondary modes of the total-length distribution were 21.8 +/- 3.0 and 27.8 +/- 2.7 mm, respectively. Although krill orientation was assumed stable and the ping rate was high, the range and inter-ping variability of the average TS values were large, decreasing and increasing with frequency, respectively. The overall TS frequency response observed and concurrent measurements at 120 and 200 kHz confirm the theoretical expectation that the acoustic backscatter from the investigated organisms were confined to the Rayleigh and Geometric scattering regions, a finding that might both aid acoustic identification and size-group separation of in situ northern krill.

The objective was to characterize composition of recovered materials. Crude protein was concentrated to 89-90% in proteins recovered at acidic pH and to 94-95% at basic pH. Basic pH yielded proteins with more (P < 0.05) essential amino acids (EAAs). EAA content in recovered proteins met FAO/WHO/UNO requirements. ISP did not affect fatty acid (FA) composition. Lipids recovered at acidic pH contained 88-89% of total fat and at basic pH, 94-97%. Total fat in recovered proteins was low, with EPA and DHA at the highest (P < 0.05) percentage for pH 11.5. ISP, particularly basic pH, effectively removed impurities such as bones and scales from whole carp. This is indicated by 3.8-5.8% of ash in recovered proteins compared to 11.2% for whole carp and 5.4% for boneless/skinless carp fillets. Basic pH yielded less (P < 0.05) Ca, P, and Mg in recovered proteins. These minerals were more (P < 0.05) concentrated in insolubles recovered with basic pH. This study indicates that materials recovered from whole carp using ISP have high nutritional value and may be useful in the development of human food and animal feeds.																	0021-8561	1520-5118				MAY 27	2009	57	10					4259	4266		10.1021/jf803974q							WOS:000266237800037	19368395

Climate-driven sympatry may not lead to foraging competition between congeneric top-predators	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS												Climate-driven sympatry may lead to competition for food resources between species. Rapid warming in the West Antarctic Peninsula (WAP) is coincident with increasing gentoo penguin and decreasing Adelie penguin populations, suggesting that competition for food may exacerbate the Adelie penguin decline. On fine scales, we tested for foraging competition between these species during the chick-rearing period by comparing their foraging behaviors with the distribution of their prey, Antarctic krill. We detected krill aggregations within the horizontal and vertical foraging ranges of Adelie and gentoo penguins, and found that krill selected for habitats that balance the need to consume food and avoid predation. In overlapping Adelie and gentoo penguin foraging areas, four gentoo penguins switched foraging behavior by foraging at deeper depths, a strategy which limits competition with Adelie penguins. This suggests that climate-driven sympatry does not necessarily result in competitive exclusion of Adelie penguins by gentoo penguins. Contrary to a recent theory, which suggests that increased competition for krill is one of the major drivers of Adelie penguin population declines, we suggest that declines in Adelie penguins along the WAP are more likely due to direct and indirect climate impacts on their life histories.																	2045-2322					JAN 6	2016	6								18820	10.1038/srep18820							WOS:000368241700001	26732496

The objective was to relate the seasonal lipid dynamics in an abundant and lipid-rich hyperbenthic species to its life cycle and to the annual phytoplankton bloom. Mysis mixta accumulated high levels of lipid reserves similar to those reached by other cold-water zooplankton. Greatest accumulation occurred in maturing females and males upon initiation of the spring bloom and continued for 6 months. The lowest TL level was similar to5% dry mass (DM) in small juveniles, post-spawned males, and spent females, and the highest level was 32% DM in females approaching full maturity (overall content range 0.3-16 mg.mysid(-1)). Most females accumulated lipid for 2 years before spawning, although a few females spawned 7 months early with a very low TL content. Seasonal variation in TL resulted primarily from net changes in triacylglycerol, the predominant neutral lipid. Seasonal and interannual variation in TL quantities in individuals and in areal concentrations of lipid in the hyperbenthic population indicates a strong trophic link between M. mixta and the pelagic production cycle.

J	Rombola, E; Marschoff, E; Coria, N				Rombola, E; Marschoff, E; Coria, N			Comparative study of the effects of the late pack-ice break-off on chinstrap and Adelie penguins' diet and reproductive success at Laurie Island, South Orkney Islands, Antarctica	POLAR BIOLOGY												The effects of ice cover on diet and breeding chronology of Adelie (Pygoscelis adeliae) and chinstrap penguins (P. antarctica) were studied in the colonies located at Point Martin, South Orkney Islands. Reproductive success and diet parameters were measured as described in the CCAMLR Environmental Monitoring Program protocols. It was found that late pack-ice break-off in 1998 resulted in lower reproductive success than in 1999 for chinstrap penguins, while Adelie penguin parameters were rather insensitive. This species has shown to be able to cope with this environmental factor, as suggested by its circumpolar and more southerly range. Significant differences in stomach contents' weights and in the proportion of whole krill were found between ice-covered and open-sea periods within and between years. Foraging trips of both species became longer, resulting in underfeeding of chicks and nest desertion by chinstrap-penguin parents. Simultaneous analysis of reproductive parameters of both species and their diets have proven to be useful in discriminating between variation in reproductive success parameters due to prey accessibility and prey abundance.																	0722-4060					JAN	2003	26	1					41	48		10.1007/s00300-002-0444-1							WOS:000180536100007

Three transects lice margin to Elephant Island, (ice margin to the Weddell-Scotia Confluence, and the Drake Passage) and a station grid in the East Bransfield Strait were laid out, seeking the greatest possible heterogeneity in hydrographic conditions. Six species were collected, with the most abundant species, Eukrohnia hamata, accounting for 83% of the total number of individuals, followed by Sagitta gazellae (9.7%). High spatial variability was observed both along the transects and over the mesoscale station grid. The station grid allowed two assemblages to be distinguished on the basis of species abundance and demographic population structure. Both assemblages were distributed through areas with distinct hydrographic characteristics. Use of a smaller sampling scale and a more detailed definition of development stages than in earlier studies revealed a higher level of spatial heterogeneity than previously suggested for chaetognaths in the Southern Ocean.

Micro- and mesozooplankton responses during two contrasting summers in a coastal Antarctic environment	POLAR BIOLOGY					11th Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research Symposium	JUL 16-19, 2013	Barcelona, SPAIN					Rapid climate-driven melting of coastal glaciers may control plankton dynamics in the Western Antarctic Peninsula. It is known that in Potter Cove, 25 de Mayo/King George Island, phytoplankton is tightly coupled to meltwater input. However, no information on zooplankton is available in this regard. The aim of this study was therefore to examine the structure and dynamics of microzooplankton and mesozooplankton in two zones (the inner and outer Potter Cove) differently impacted by glacier melting during two contrasting austral summers (2010 and 2011). Microzooplankton composition differed between the two zones and years analyzed, and its total biomass was observed to be highest far from the glacier influence and during 2010. Mesozooplankton composition and biomass were similar in the two zones and years analyzed. Colder than usual conditions in the summer of 2010 prevented glacier melting, thus favoring the development of an exceptional micro-sized diatom bloom (similar to 190 mu g C l(-1) and >15 mu g l(-1) chlorophyll a), which was tightly followed by a maximum in large copepod abundance. After the bloom and in coincidence with intense glacier melting, large diatoms and large copepods were observed to be replaced by nanophytoplankton and microzooplankton (aloricate ciliates and dinoflagellates), respectively. In 2011, low phytoplankton abundance, probably controlled by high tintinnid biomass, was observed as a result of warmer temperatures than 2010 and low-salinity waters. Large copepods appeared to have exerted a high grazing pressure on aloricate ciliates and heterotrophic dinoflagellates in 2011. Our results suggest that whereas the joint effect of water temperature, salinity and phytoplankton availability as well as composition could be of primary relevance in structuring micro- and mesozooplankton community, zooplankton could be of secondary relevance in controlling phytoplankton biomass in Potter Cove during the two summers analyzed.

J	Joiris, CR; Dochy, O				Joiris, Claude R.; Dochy, Olivier			A major autumn feeding ground for fin whales, southern fulmars and grey-headed albatrosses around the South Shetland Islands, Antarctica	POLAR BIOLOGY												The main aim of our long-term study on the at-sea distribution of the upper trophic levels in polar marine ecosystems is to deepen the understanding of the basic mechanisms affecting their distribution, i.e. hydrological factors such as water masses and fronts, pack ice and ice edge, eddies. A second goal consists in detecting spatial and temporal changes, with special attention to global climate changes, as well as possible consequences of (krill) fisheries. Seabirds and marine mammals were recorded during an autumn expedition of icebreaking RV Polarstern between Punta Arenas and the South Shetland Islands, Antarctica in March/ April 2012. During a total of 333 half-an-hour transect counts without width limitation, 113,500 seabirds were encountered, belonging to 40 species. The vast majority were southern fulmars and grey-headed albatross around the South Shetland Islands, with 76,800 and 7,000 individuals, respectively. Fin whale was by far the most abundant cetacean with 300 identified individuals in the same area, of which 100 in one count. These exceptional concentrations of fin whale seem to reflect an autumn pre-migration feeding aggregation. For most species, the majority was concentrated in very few counts, reflecting a very high patchiness and, as upper trophic levels, an important prey availability-mainly krill, nekton and small fish. Low biodiversity was reflected by both the low number of species and the fact that a few species represent the vast majority in numbers. It is suggested that the area deserves future biological studies, especially in autumn, and a special protection management.																	0722-4060	1432-2056				NOV	2013	36	11					1649	1658		10.1007/s00300-013-1383-8							WOS:000326049100010

Body length shrinkage in an endangered amphibian is associated with drought	JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY												Shrinkage in body length, followed by growth, has rarely been documented in vertebrates and has been associated with stressful energetic and environmental conditions. Here, we document reversible shrinkage in an amphibian for the first time. Jollyville Plateau salamanders Eurycea tonkawae are neotenic (attain maturity while retaining an aquatic larval form) and inhabit springs and caves of a dissected aquifer in Travis County, TX, USA. We conducted mark-recapture surveys on a spring-dwelling population before and after an exceptional drought in 2008. Use of unique marks and digital photographs of individuals provided precise information on salamander growth rates during and after a period in which salamanders retreated to underground refugia to avoid desiccation during the drought. Tail width decreased significantly during the drought indicating a reduction in energy stores, a consequence of stressful environmental conditions. Unexpectedly, body length shrinkage also occurred during the drought and was followed by positive growth when spring flow resumed. Body length shrinkage could be an adaptation to coping with long periods of low food availability although its long-term effects are unknown. Given the influence of body size on many ecological and physiological characteristics of organisms, plasticity in body size may have important consequences that go undetected by researchers if shrinkage is ignored.

Cumulative solar irradiance and potential large-scale sea ice algae distribution off East Antarctica (30A degrees E-150A degrees E)	POLAR BIOLOGY												We present a computational model of the large-scale cumulative light exposure of sea ice in the Southern Ocean off East Antarctica (30A degrees E-150A degrees E). The model uses remotely sensed or modelled sea ice concentration, snow depth over sea ice, and solar irradiance data, and tracks sea ice motion over the season of interest in order to calculate the cumulative exposure of the ice field to photosynthetically active radiation (PAR). Light is the limiting factor to sea ice algal growth over winter and early spring, and so the results have implications for the estimation of algal biomass in East Antarctica. The model results indicate that highly light-exposed ice is restricted to within a few degrees of the coast in the eastern part of the study region, but extends much further north in the 30A degrees E-100A degrees E sector. The relative influences of sea ice motion, solar flux, and snow depth variations on interannual variations in model predictions were evaluated. The model estimates of cumulative PAR were found to correlate with satellite estimates of subsequent open-water chlorophyll-a concentration, consistent with the notion that sea ice algae can provide inocula for phytoplankton blooms.																	0722-4060	1432-2056				MAR	2009	32	3					443	452		10.1007/s00300-008-0538-5							WOS:000263389000013						
J	SCHLOSS, I; ESTRADA, M				SCHLOSS, I; ESTRADA, M			PHYTOPLANKTON COMPOSITION IN THE WEDDELL-SCOTIA CONFLUENCE AREA DURING AUSTRAL SPRING IN RELATION TO HYDROGRAPHY	POLAR BIOLOGY												During the EPOS leg 2 cruise of the RV ''Polarstern'', carried out in late austral spring of 1988-1989, the composition of phytoplankton in relation to the distribution of hydrographic parameters was studied in four successive transects carried out along 49-degrees-W and 47-degrees-W, across the Weddell-Scotia Confluence (WSC) and the marginal ice zone (which overlapped in part). In all transects, a maximum of phytoplankton biomass was found in the WSC, in surface waters stabilized by ice melting. Different phytoplankton assemblages could be distinguished. North of the Scotia Front (the northern limit of the WSC) diatoms with Chaetoceros neglectus, Nitzschia spp. and Thalassiosira gravida) dominated the phytoplankton community. This assemblage appeared to have seeded a biomass maximum which occupied, during the first transect, an area of the WSC, south of the Scotia Front. The southernmost stations of the first transect and all the stations to the south of the Scotia Front in the other transects were populated by a flagellate assemblage (with a cryptomonad, Pyramimonas spp. and Phaeocystis sp.) and an assemblage of diatoms (Corethron criophilum and Tropidoneis vanheurkii among others) associated to the presence of ice. During the last three transects, the flagellate assemblage formed a bloom in the low salinity surface layers of the WSC zone. The bulk of the biomass maximum was formed by the cryptomonad which reached concentrations up to 4 x 10(6) cells l-1 towards the end of the cruise. Multivariate analysis is used to summarize phytoplankton composition variation. The relationships between the distribution of the different assemblages and the hydrographic conditions indicate that the change of dominance from diatoms to flagellates in the WSC zone was related to the presence of water masses from different origin.

J	DITTRICH, B				DITTRICH, B			THERMAL-ACCLIMATION AND KINETICS OF A TRYPSIN-LIKE PROTEASE IN EUCARID CRUSTACEANS	JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE PHYSIOLOGY B-BIOCHEMICAL SYSTEMIC AND ENVIRONMENTAL PHYSIOLOGY												The properties of a trypsin-like protease in homogenates from midgut glands and gastric fluids of crustaceans were analyzed with special emphasis on thermal acclimation. For comparison, four species from different climatic regions were investigated: Ocypode ryderi (tropical), Cancer pagurus (temperate), Meganyctiphanes norvegica (subarctic-boreal), and Chorismus antarcticus (Antarctic). The pH optimum of the hydrolysis of N-benzoyl-L-arginine-p-nitroanilide is similar in all four species; at 25-degrees-C it ranged between pH 8 and 9.5. In the gastric fluids, pH was between 6.4 (Chorismus) and 7.7 (Ocypode); under experimental conditions at 25-degrees-C, between 25% (Chorismus) and 95% (Ocypode) of maximal activity were observed at these pH values. Temperature optima of protease activity are independent from mean ambient temperature and were found to be around 50-degrees-C in Ocypode, 45-degrees-C in Cancer, 50-55-degrees-C in Meganycliphanes, and 40-degrees-C in Chorismus. At temperatures near 0-degrees-C, temperate and tropical species show either a very low or even no activity at all, whereas the Antarctic and subarctic-boreal species display a residual activity of up to 15% of maximum activity. Under natural conditions, approximately 50% of maximal available enzymatic activity are eventually utilized. The kinetic parameters V(max) and K(m) depend on temperature and show distinct differences between the species. As an immediate response to temperature changes, the affinity for substrate decreases with elevated temperatures. Cold adaptation implies an effective utilization of energy in a low-energy system; the most prominent means of adaptation to low temperatures is the reduction of activation energy. Energies of activation in tropical temperate, and subarctic-boreal species (23.3-31.5 kJ . mol-1) are significantly higher than in the Antarctic species (11.9-13.6 kJ . mol-1). The enzymes were inhibited by N-tosyl-L-lysine chloromethyl ketone, copper sulfate, mercury chloride, and silver nitrate. In all enzymes, soybean trypsin inhibitor was the most effective inhibitor. Activation occurred after application of bovine serum albumin or calcium and magnesium chloride. The species-specific reactions after application of different protein or salt solutions support the hypothesis of decisive differences at the molecular level.																	0174-1578					JAN	1992	162	1					38	46									WOS:A1992HB81800006

Combining a krill growth model with projected climate scenarios shows the growth habitat is likely to experience only moderate change, with the northern edges most at risk. Antarctic krill is a key species of important Southern Ocean food webs, yet how changes in ocean temperature and primary production may impact their habitat quality remains poorly understood. We provide a circumpolar assessment of the robustness of krill growth habitat to climate change by coupling an empirical krill growth model with projections from a weighted subset of IPCC Earth system models. We find that 85% of the study area experienced only a moderate change in relative gross growth potential (+/- 20%) by 2100. However, a temporal shift in seasonal timings of habitat quality may cause disjunctions between krill's biological timings and the future environment. Regions likely to experience habitat quality decline or retreat are concentrated near the northern limits of krill distribution and in the Amundsen-Bellingshausen seas region during autumn, meaning habitat will likely shift to higher latitudes in these areas.

Mitochondrial DNA polymorphism (CO1) of three dominant copepod species in the South Atlantic	OCEANOLOGY												The Southern Ocean is characterized by the complex system of oceanic fronts that maintain the latitudinal zonality of biotopes. These fronts are boundaries of water masses with different hydrophysical characteristics. We explore the genetic differentiation of the dominant zooplankton species in regards to the complex hydrophysical zonality of the Southern Ocean. The barcoding region of mitochondrial CO1 gene was sequenced for three copepod species, Calanus simillimus, Rhincalanus gigas, and Metridia lucens. These species are the most abundant in the Southern Ocean and form the basis of the zooplankton community. Genetic differentiation was found neither for Calanus simillimus nor for Rhincalanus gigas. The mitochondrial haplotypes of Metridia lucens cluster in two genetically distant groups (Subantarctic and Antarctic) found together only in the Polar Front Zone.

Data obtained from these drifters and from a select number of local historical drifters provide the most detailed observations to date of the surface circulation in the northwestern Weddell Sea. The Antarctic Slope Front (ASF), characterized by a similar to 20 cm s(-1) current following the 1000-m isobath, is the dominant feature east of the peninsula. The slope front bifurcates when it encounters the South Scotia Ridge with the drifters following one of three paths. Drifters (i) are carried westward into Bransfield Strait; (ii) follow the 1000-m isobath to the east along the southern edge of the South Scotia Ridge; or (iii) become entrained in a large-standing eddy over the South Scotia Ridge. Drifters are strongly steered by contours of f/h (Coriolis frequency/depth) as shown by calculations of the first two moments of displacement in both geographic coordinates and coordinates locally aligned with contours of f/h. An eddy-mean decomposition of the drifter velocities indicates that shear in the mean flow makes the dominant contribution to dispersion in the along-f/h direction, but eddy processes are more important in dispersing particles across contours of f/h. The results of the ADELIE study suggest that the circulation near the tip of the Antarctic Peninsula may influence ecosystem dynamics in the Southern Ocean through Antarctic krill transport and the export of nutrients.

J	Iverson, SJ; Arnould, JPY; Boyd, IL				Iverson, SJ; Arnould, JPY; Boyd, IL			Milk fatty acid signatures indicate both major and minor shifts in the diet of lactating Antarctic fur seals	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY												Fatty acid signature analysis is based on the principle that unique arrays of fatty acids within groups of organisms can be transferred, largely unaltered, up the marine food chain and thus may be an indicator of diet composition. We applied fatty acid signature analysis to milks collected from Antarctic fur seals (Arctocephalus gazella) at South Georgia in 1990-1991, during the perinatal period (N = 19) and subsequently during early (N = II), mid (N = 11), and late (N = 8) foraging trips. In lactating otariid females, milk fatty acids secreted during the perinatal fast are derived largely from blubber mobilization and thus are influenced by dietary history prior to parturition. Conversely, milk fatty acids secreted during foraging trips are derived primarily from immediate dietary intake. The fatty acid signature of perinatal milks was significantly different from that of all other milks, suggesting differences in the prepartum diet when females are away from the breeding grounds. At the onset of foraging periods, the fatty acid composition of milks changed dramatically to reflect a diet composed mainly of krill. However, during late foraging periods, milk fatty acids again changed from those of early and mid foraging, and suggested a predominance of teleost fish in the diet. These findings were consistent with independent assessments of diet by faecal analysis and indicate the potential value of fatty acid signature analysis in studying foraging ecology in free-ranging pinnipeds.																	0008-4301	1480-3283				FEB	1997	75	2					188	197		10.1139/z97-026							WOS:A1997XB77500004						
J	Berg, ICH; Muller, D; Arnebrant, T; Malmsten, M				Berg, ICH; Muller, D; Arnebrant, T; Malmsten, M			Ellipsometry and TIRF studies of enzymatic degradation of interfacial proteinaceous layers	LANGMUIR												Ellipsometry and total internal reflectance fluorescence spectroscopy (TIRF) have been employed to investigate the layer structure of gelatin adsorbed from aqueous solutions onto silica/glass and methylated silica/glass, as well as the effects of addition of the proteolytic enzymes krillase and trypsin, in relation to temperature, enzyme concentration, and enzymatic activity. The results for the hydrophilic substrates show that homogeneous and heterogeneous exchange occurs readily, as does autolysis of trypsin at the interface. At the hydrophobic substrates, the effect of exchange is limited and a residual gelatin fraction is present at the interface throughout. The interfacial behavior of gelatin above and below the helix formation temperature (T-helix) shows that more extended surface layers are formed at both substrates below Thelix At the hydrophilic substrates, the higher adsorbed layer thickness below Thelix is mainly due to the adsorption of more gelatin than at the higher temperature, whereas, at the hydrophobic substrates, the increase in layer thickness below Thelix is due to a decrease in packing density. Enzyme addition to preadsorbed gelatin at methylated silica results in the transition to a thinner and denser layer that contains both residual gelatin and proteolytic enzymes (i.e., krillase or trypsin). At hydrophobic surfaces, a faster and more extensive degradation of the gelatin layer is observed with increasing krillase concentration, the effect of which is similar above and below Thelix The effect of trypsin addition to preadsorbed gelatin is enhanced at T < T-helix, which is somewhat counterintuitive considering the structure of gelatin in relation to temperature. Quantitatively, the degree of gelatin degradation after addition of trypsin at T < T-helix was found to be higher than after addition of a 500 times higher concentration at T > T-helix Finally, the exposure of preadsorbed gelatin to inactivated krillase showed a nearly complete elimination in the effects observed upon addition of intact krillase. This indicated that the enzymatic activity of krillase in its native form plays a major role for the interaction between krillase and preadsorbed gelatin.																	0743-7463					MAR 6	2001	17	5					1641	1652		10.1021/la0008683							WOS:000167290800050

Managing fishery development in sensitive ecosystems: identifying penguin habitat use to direct management in Antarctica	ECOSPHERE												In the Southern Ocean, the at-sea distributions of most predators of Antarctic krill are poorly known, primarily because tracking studies have only been undertaken on a restricted set of species, and then only at a limited number of sites. For chinstrap penguins, one of the most abundant krill predators breeding across the Antarctic Peninsula, we show that habitat models developed utilizing the distance from the colony and the bearing to the shelf-edge, adjusting for the at-sea density of Pygoscelis penguins from other colonies, can be used to predict, with a high level of confidence, the at-sea distribution of chinstrap penguins from untracked colonies during the breeding season. Comparison of predicted penguin distributions with outputs from a high-resolution oceanographic model shows that chinstrap penguins prefer nearshore habitats, over shallow bathymetry, with slow-flowing waters, but that they sometimes also travel to areas beyond the edge of the continental shelf where the faster-flowing waters of the Coastal Current or the fronts of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current occur. In the slow-moving shelf waters, large penguin colonies may lead to krill depletion during incubation and chick-rearing periods when penguins are acting as central place foragers. The habitats used by chinstrap penguins are also locations preferentially used by the commercial krill fishery, one of the last under-developed marine capture fisheries anywhere on the planet. As it develops, this fishery has the potential to compete with chinstrap penguins and other natural krill predators. Scaling our habitat models by chinstrap penguin population data demonstrates where overlap with the fishery is likely to be most important. Our results suggest that a better understanding of krill retention and krill depletion in areas used by natural predators and by the krill fishery are needed, and that risk management strategies for the fishery should include assessment of how krill movement can satisfy the demands of both natural predators and the fishery across a range of spatial and temporal scales. Such information will help regional management authorities better understand how plausible ecosystem-based management frameworks could be developed to ensure sustainable co-existence of the fishery and competing natural predators.

Surveys were conducted from the RVIB N.B. Palmer in austral fall (April-June) and winter (July-August) of 2001. Acoustic, video, and environmental data were collected along 13 transect lines running across the shelf and perpendicular to the Western Antarctic Peninsula coastline, between 65degreesS and 70degreesS. Depth-stratified net tows conducted at selected locations provided ground-truthing for acoustic observations. In fall, acoustic volume backscattering strength at 120 kHz was greatest. in the southern reaches of the survey area and inside Marguerite Bay, suggestive of high zooplankton and micronekton biomass in these regions. Vertically, highest backscattering was in the 150-450 m depth range, associated with modified Circumpolar Deep Water (CDW). The two deep troughs that intersect the shelf break were characterized by reduced backscattering, similar to levels observed off-shelf and indicative of lower zooplankton biomass in recent intrusions of CDW onto the continental shelf. Estimates of dynamic height suggested that geostrophic circulation likely caused both along- and across-shelf transport of zooplankton. By winter, scattering had decreased by an order of magnitude (10 dB) in the upper 300 m of the water column in most areas, and high backscattering levels were found primarily in a deep (> 300 m) scattering layer present close to the bottom. The seasonal decrease is potentially explained by advection of zooplankton, vertical and horizontal movements, and mortality. Predictions of expected backscattering levels based on net samples suggested that large euphausiids were the dominant source of backscattering only at very particular locations and depths, and that copepods, siphonophores, and pteropods were more important in many locations.

In this work, an acoustic scattering model has been developed for fluid-like zooplankton that is based on the distorted wave Born approximation (DWBA) and that makes use of high-resolution three-dimensional measurements of the animal's outer boundary shape. High-resolution computerized tomography (CT) was used to determine the three-dimensional digitizations of animal shape. This study focuses on developing the methodology for incorporating high-resolution CT scans into a scattering model that is generally valid for any body with fluid-like material properties. The model predictions are compared to controlled laboratory measurements of the acoustic backscattering from live individual decapod shrimp. The frequency range used was 50 kHz to 1 MHz and the angular characteristics of the backscattering were investigated with up to a 1degrees angular resolution. The practical conditions under which it is necessary to make use of high-resolution digitizations of shape are assessed. 9 2002 Acoustical Society of America.

Duration of the entire molt cycle increased about 3-fold with a decrease in temperature from 25 to 6 degrees C, but increased by <2-fold over an 80-fold difference in food concentration. There was a strong (r(2) = 0.95) linear relationship between chitobiase activity and duration of the molt cycle, as modulated by food concentration, in asynchronous populations of D. magna. The relationship between chitobiase activity and duration of the molt cycle, as modulated by temperature, was also highly significant (r(2) = 0.77) but nonlinear. The relationship between chitobiase activity and temperature is also nonlinear (r(2) = 0.67). A significant linear relationship between chitobiase activity and duration of the molt cycle was also found for a natural population of Daphnia rosea (r(2) = 0.88). Regressions of enzyme activity with body size and glucosamine content for three species of Daphnia indicate that differences exist between species. Chitobiase activity is an index of the proportion of animals in apolysis in a population. Because this proportion changes as a function of food concentration, but apparently not as a function of temperature, chitobiase activity is a measure of the duration of the molt cycle as limited by food concentration.																	0024-3590	1939-5590				SEP	1995	40	6					1028	1034		10.4319/lo.1995.40.6.1028							WOS:A1995RY89500002

Yet, the changing cryosphere impacts society within Antarctica as well, and this article expands the focus of Antarctic ice research to include human activities on and around the continent. It reframes Antarctica as a place with human history and local activities that are being affected by melting ice, even if the consequences are much smaller in scale than the effects of global sea level rise. Specifically focused on tourism and conservation along the west Antarctica Peninsula (wAP), this article demonstrates the impacts of changing glaciers and sea ice on the timing, location, and type of tourism as well as the ability of changing ice to mediate human experiences through conservation agendas. As future ice conditions influence Antarctic tourism and conservation, an attention to issues emerging within the wAP region offers a new perspective on climate change impacts and the management of Antarctic activities in the 21st-century Anthropocene.

Public acceptance of krill for human consumption will depend partly on its nutritive value. The aim of this article is to assess the nutritive value and potential health benefits of krill, an abundant food source with high nutritional value and a variety of compounds relevant to human health. Krill is a rich source of high-quality protein, with the advantage over other animal proteins of being low in fat and a rich source of omega-3 fatly acids. Antioxidant levels in krill are higher than in fish, suggesting benefits against oxidative damage. Finally, the waste generated by the processing of krill into edible products can be developed into value-added products.

Yet, little is known about the distributions of bacterial biomass and production in winter, and how these distributions may be influenced by local physical oceanographic features or interrelated to other chemical and biological distributions in the MIZ. To help elucidate the ecological and biogeochemical significance of bacterial production in winter, we examined the distributions of bacterial biomass and production in the MIZ of the Weddell-Scotia Sea in austral winter 1988 as part of the Antarctic Marine Ecosystem Research at the Ice-edge Zone (AMERIEZ) program. Measurements were made along 3 rapid transects providing a synoptic view of the MIZ. Transects were oriented normal to the ice edge with stations extending up to 100 km into the pack and several hundred km seaward of the ice edge. Winter distributions of bacterial biomass and production were more closely related to local hydrography than to microalgal distributions or the proximity of the ice edge. Bacterial characteristics were highest within or in the proximity of warm-core eddies, enrichments which may have resulted from prior ice melt or from advection of more productive waters. Microalgal characteristics and bacterial production were at their seasonal minimum during the winter cruise; however, bacterial biomass was essentially invariant seasonally and was not as greatly influenced by the location of the ice edge as previously demonstrated for phytoplankton. Similar reports for micrograzers suggest that steady-state conditions apply to much of the microbial food web throughout the year. Bacterial production did not dominate ammonium remineralization processes in winter; instead, ammonium maxima under the ice and near the ice edge were attributed to protozooplankton and higher trophic organisms.

Age and growth of Brauer's lanternfish Gymnoscopelus braueri and rhombic lanternfish Krefftichthys anderssoni (Family Myctophidae) in the Scotia Sea, Southern Ocean	JOURNAL OF FISH BIOLOGY												This study examines age and growth of Brauer's lanternfish Gymnoscopelus braueri and rhombic lanternfish Krefftichthys anderssoni from the Scotia Sea in the Southern Ocean, through the analysis of annual growth increments deposited on sagittal otoliths. Otolith pairs from 177 G. braueri and 118 K. anderssoni were collected in different seasons from the region between 2004 and 2009. Otolith-edge analysis suggested a seasonal change in opaque and hyaline depositions, indicative of an annual growth pattern, although variation within the populations of both species was apparent. Age estimates varied from 1 to 6 years for G. braueri (40 to 139 mm standard length; L-S) and from 0 to 2 years for K. anderssoni (26 to 70 mm L-S). Length-at-age data were broadly consistent with population cohort parameters identified in concurrent length-frequency data from the region for both species. The estimated values of von Bertalanffy growth curves for G. braueri were L-infinity = 133.22 mm, k = 0.29 year(-1) and t(0) = -0.21 year and the values for K. anderssoni were L-infinity = 68.60 mm, k = 0.71 year(-1) and t(0) = -0.49 year. There were no significant (P > 0.05) differences in growth between sexes for either species, suggesting that males and females have similar growth and development trajectories in the Scotia Sea. A positive allometric relationship between L-S and wet mass was found for each species, as well as a significant (P < 0.0001) linear relationship between otolith size and L-S. Growth performance (CYRILLIC CAPITAL LETTER EF ') was similar between the two species and congruent with other myctophid species across the Southern Ocean. This study provides important parameters for future Southern Ocean ecosystem studies in a resource management context.

Seasonal similarity in rates of protistan herbivory in fjords along the Western Antarctic Peninsula	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												We quantified phytoplankton growth and protistan grazing rates during late austral autumn 2013 and late austral spring 2014, in several glacio-marine fjords and connecting channels along the Western Antarctic Peninsula (WAP). During austral autumn, low and declining chlorophyll a (Chl a) concentrations (<= 0.4 mu g L-1) were almost entirely composed of pico/nanophytoplankton, whereas during austral spring, high but patchy Chl a concentrations in the fjords (up to 18.5 mu g L-1) reflected a diatom bloom. These contrasting dynamics were associated with high seasonal differences in irradiance, but not temperature, and were consistent with the balance resulting from lower phytoplankton growth rates in autumn (-0.01 d(-1) to 0.19 d(-1)) than in spring (0.06-0.93 d(-1)) but similar magnitudes of herbivorous grazing in both seasons. Grazing was either absent or low (0.11-0.26 d(-1)) and restricted to the picophytoplankton and nanophytoplankton. In the productive fjords lining the WAP, a fraction of primary production was channelled through a persistent and across-seasons equally active microbial food web, while during spring an increasing fraction of organic carbon shifted from trophic transfer and recycling to an export pathway.

Projected shifts in the foraging habitat of crabeater seals along the Antarctic Peninsula	NATURE CLIMATE CHANGE												Crabeater seals exhibit extreme dietary specialization, feeding almost exclusively on Antarctic krill. This specialization has inextricably linked habitat use, life history and evolution of this pinniped species to the distribution of its prey. Therefore, the foraging habitat of crabeater seals can be used to infer the distribution of Antarctic krill. Here, we combined seal movements and diving behaviour with environmental variables to build a foraging habitat model for crabeater seals for the rapidly changing western Antarctic Peninsula (WAP). Our projections show that future crabeater seal foraging habitat and, by inference, krill distribution will expand towards offshore waters and the southern WAP in response to changes in circulation, water temperature and sea ice distribution. Antarctic krill biomass is projected to be negatively affected by the environmental changes, which are anticipated to manifest as a decrease in krill densities in coastal waters, with impacts on the land-/ice-based krill predator community, particularly in the northern WAP. Crabeater seals feed predominantly on Antarctic krill. Combining seal tracks and diving behaviour with environmental variables allows the future foraging habitat, and therefore krill distribution, to be predicted, suggesting a shift offshore and south along the western Antarctic Peninsula.

Swimming capacity measured as propulsive force can be estimated by attaching the animal to a virtually friction free rotational displacement transducer with an arm allowing only forward and backward movements. The method also allows determination of beat rates of the pleopod cycle. Results from the use of the method on different sizes, sexes and moult stages of Northern krill Aleganyctiphanes norvegica indicate that the swimming capacity of krill increases with the size of the animal, although pleopod beat frequency decreases with increasing size of the animal. We found no difference in swimming capacity between females and males, but female krill had a higher pleopod beat frequency than males. The moult stage of the animal affects the swimming capacity, with newly moulted krill being weaker swimmers. It also affects pleopod beat frequency, with newly moulted krill having the lowest frequency. We argue that results of this kind may be useful in attempts to interpret observed demographic distribution patterns in migration studies as well as in studies of krill population dynamics.

Compositional Information Useful for Authentication of Krill Oil and the Detection of Adulterants	FOOD ANALYTICAL METHODS												Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and chromatography, particularly thin layer chromatography with flame ionisation detector (TLC-FID), were used to investigate fish oil adulteration of krill oil with ethyl esters and triacylglycerol. Natural krill oil has higher levels of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) in phospholipid than in triacylglycerol and so high levels of these omega-3 fatty acids in krill oil triacylglycerol was indicative of adulteration. Carbon (C-13) NMR detected adulteration of krill oil with 10% or more anchovy oil, while TLC-FID detected levels as low as 1% adulteration with EPA ethyl esters. However, positional distribution of EPA and DHA, as determined using C-13 NMR, was similar for both fish oil and krill oil, indicating that positional distribution cannot be used to show adulteration. Phosphorous (P-31) NMR spectroscopy can show adulteration with low cost sources of phospholipid but was not useful for determining adulteration of krill oil with fish oil.

Distribution of fish and macrozooplankton in ice-covered and open-water areas of the eastern Bering Sea	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY												The eastern Bering Sea shelf is a productive ecosystem with extensive commercial fisheries. Although the area is well-studied during summer months, little is known about the abundance and distribution of fish and macrozooplankton during periods of seasonal ice cover. The use of an icebreaker during the Bering Sea Ecosystem Study (BEST) provided a platform for spring acoustic surveys of fish and zooplankton in ice-covered areas for the first time. Icebreaker measurements were complemented with observations from conventional vessels during spring and summer. In spring, very little backscatter from fish (dominated by walleye pollock, Theragra chalcogramma) was observed in the ice-covered northern areas where near-bottom waters were cold (<similar to 0.5 degrees C), including areas where walleye pollock are abundant in summer. The majority of fish were observed within 40 km (and often slightly inside) the ice edge over similar seafloor depths as in summer. Together, these observations suggest that pollock, a dominant component of the ecosystem, shift their distribution to a more restricted geographic area in spring, following the ice edge southeast along the bathymetry, away from areas of cold water and extensive ice cover, then reoccupying these areas in summer. In contrast, acoustic backscatter attributed to zooplankton (likely dominated by euphausiids) was more evenly distributed, and less restricted by water temperature and ice cover. The implications of this seasonal shift in fish distribution are uncertain, but this may affect predator-prey interactions by reducing overlap of pollock with euphausiids, an important prey source, while increasing overlap of adult and juvenile pollock and potentially increasing cannibalism.

Theoretical models have been developed for three zooplankton scattering classes (hard elastic-shelled, e.g., pteropods; fluid-like, e,g,, euphausiids; and gas-bearing, e.g., siphonophores), providing a sound basis for model-based classification approaches. The Covariance Mean Variance Classification (CMVC) techniques classify broad-band echoes from individual zooplankton based on comparisons of observed echo spectra to model space realizations. Three different CMVC algorithms were developed: the Integrated Score Classifier, the Pairwise Score Classifier, and the Bayesian Probability Classifier; these classifiers assign observations to a class based on similarities in covariance, mean, and variance while accounting for model space ambiguity and validity. The CMVC techniques were applied to broad-band (similar to 350-750 kHz) echoes acquired from 24 different zooplankton to invert for scatterer class and properties. All three classification algorithms had a high rate of success with high-quality high SNR data. Accurate acoustic classification of zooplankton species has the potential to significantly improve estimates of zooplankton biomass made from ocean acoustic backscatter measurements.

Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (?-3 PUFAs) have cardio-protective benefits. However, egg is typically a poor source of ?-3 PUFAs and, in general, the American diet is low in these cardio-protective fatty acids. Novel, nutritionally enhanced egg products were developed by substituting yolk with ?-3 PUFA-rich flaxseed, menhaden, algae, or krill oil. Experimental egg products matched composition of hen egg (whole egg). The experimental egg products, mixed whole egg, and a liquid egg product (Egg Beater(TM)) were microwave-cooked and compared. RESULTS: Although fat, protein, and moisture contents of experimental egg products matched (P > 0.05) mixed whole egg, experimental egg products had more (P < 0.05).- 3 PUFAs, lower (P < 0.05).- 6/.- 3 ratio, and depending on oil added, a higher (P < 0.05) unsaturated/ saturated fatty acids ratio compared to mixed whole egg. Triglycerides were themain lipid class in all experimental egg products except those developed with krill oil, which had even more phospholipids than mixed whole egg. Analysis of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances showed that lipid oxidation of experimental egg products was lower (P < 0.05) or similar (P > 0.05) to mixed whole egg, except for experimental egg products with krill oil. However, peroxide value showed that all egg samples had minimal oxidation. Experimental egg products developed with menhaden or flaxseed oil had the highest (P < 0.05) concentration of the antioxidant, ethyoxquin compared to all other egg samples. However, experimental egg products with krill oil likely contained a natural antioxidant, astaxanthin. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated an alternative approach to developing novel, nutraceutical egg products. Instead of dietary modification of chicken feed, yolk substitutionwith.- 3 PUFAs oils resulted in enhancement of.- 3 PUFAs beyond levels possible to achieve by modifying chicken feed.

During late winter/early spring older stages of C. acutus were concentrated below 500 m. Males had reduced mouthparts and were only found in October/November in deep waters where mating occurred. Females with semiripe and ripe gonads migrated to the surface in November to spawn. Their ascent coincided with an increase in swimming and respiration activity. In summer the majority of C. acutus occurred above 200 m and the density increased dramatically as the new cohort hatched. Copepodite stage CV and females in the surface layers had large lipid depots by the end of January, mainly wax esters. They seem to start their descent by mid February. C. propinquus also occurred in deeper waters in late winter/early spring, but above 500 m. Males had well-developed mouthparts and were found in small numbers throughout both investigated periods. No great changes in activity were observed from late winter to summer. The summer population was concentrated in the upper 100 m. As for C. acutus there was a dramatic increase in abundance of C. propinquus from January to February. The lipid content of CV stages and females doubled from January to February and reached similar maximum values at least 3 wk later in the season than C. acutus. The lipids of C. propinquus consisted mainly of triacylglycerol, a very unusual storage lipid class in polar calanoid copepods. C. acutus and C. propinquus seem to represent different life histories: the wax-ester-accumulating C. acutus overwinters in a resting stage in deeper waters while the triacylglycerol-storing C. propinquus may feed and reproduce over a more extended period than C. acutus.

The prepared A-Chitosan powder showed low level of crystallinity and significantly high water binding capacity as 1293% (w/w). By mice tail amputation model and blood coagulation timing experiment, it is showed that this chitosan accelerated the tail hemostasis by 55% and shortened the blood clotting time by 38%. This efficacy was better than two other commercial chitosans investigated and was corresponding to their water binding capacities. Through examining the effect of chitosan on blood components, it could be found that platelets adhesion was mainly affected by the water binding capacity, and red blood cells aggregation was dependent on their deacetylation degree. The physicochemical properties resulted in better hydration property of chitosan would improve its hemostatic effect. These results suggested that Antarctic krill chitosan is a good candidate for hemostatic application. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The same procedure is followed for chitin isolations for both the species. First, HCl was used for removing of minerals in the organisms, and then, the protein structure was removed by using NaOH. Chitins obtained from these two species were characterized physicochemically. Physicochemical properties of chitins isolated from the insect and the crustacean were compared to each other. The chitin content for dry weights of M. melolontha and O. asellus were recorded as 13-14 and 6-7 %, respectively. The results of Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis and X-ray diffraction analysis were found to be more or less similar. The surface morphologies of chitins were examined via environmental scanning electron microscopy and nanofibers, and pore structures were observed. While the chitin nanofibers of O. asellus were adherent to each other, nanofibers of M. melolontha were non-adherent. On the other hand, the number of pores was much higher in the chitin from M. melolontha than in the chitin from O. asellus. Looking at the elemental analysis results, the M. melolontha chitin was found to be more pure than the O. asellus chitin. For this reason, M. melolontha has been considered more attractive source for chitin than O. asellus.

Scaling of lunge feeding in rorqual whales: An integrated model of engulfment duration	JOURNAL OF THEORETICAL BIOLOGY												Rorqual whales (Balaenopteridae) obtain their food by lunge feeding, a dynamic process that involves the intermittent engulfment and filtering of large amounts of water and prey. During a lunge, whales accelerate to high speed and open their mouth wide, thereby exposing a highly distensible buccal cavity to the flow and facilitating its inflation. Unsteady hydrodynamic models suggest that the muscles associated with the ventral groove blubber undergo eccentric contraction in order to stiffen and control the inflation of the buccal cavity; in doing so the engulfed water mass is accelerated forward as the whale's body slows down. Although the basic mechanics of lunge feeding are relatively well known, the scaling of this process remains poorly understood, particularly with regards to its duration (from mouth opening to closure). Here we formulate a new theory of engulfment time which integrates prey escape behavior with the mechanics of the whale's body, including lunge speed and acceleration, gape angle dynamics, and the controlled inflation of the buccal cavity. Given that the complex interaction between these factors must be highly coordinated in order to maximize engulfment volume, the proposed formulation rests on the scenario of Synchronized Engulfment, whereby the filling of the cavity (posterior to the temporomandibular joint) coincides with the moment of maximum gape. When formulated specifically for large rorquals feeding on krill, our analysis predicts that engulfment time increases with body size, but in amounts dictated by the specifics of krill escape and avoidance kinematics. The predictions generated by the model are corroborated by limited empirical data on a species-specific basis, particularly for humpback and blue whales chasing krill. A sensitivity analysis applied to all possible sized fin whales also suggests that engulfment duration and lunge speed will increase intra-specifically with body size under a wide range of predator-prey scenarios. This study provides the theoretical framework required to estimate the scaling of the mass-specific drag being generated during engulfment, as well as the energy expenditures incurred.

Feb.) of 1988, 1989 and 1990. Copepods were the major components of epipelagic zooplankton (in numbers) with dominance of Metridia gerlachei (1988 and 1989) and small calanoids and cyclopoids (1990). Euphausiids and salps were the next most abundant groups. The percent composition of euphausiids decreased from 1988 to 1990 while that of salps increased. The abundance of salps exceeded euphausiids and major taxa of copepods in 1990. Local patches of polychaetes and amphipods were also found. Statistically significant annual variations with increased numbers in 1990 were found by analyses of variance in total abundance, abundances of copepods, salps, chaetognaths and amphipods, but abundances of euphausiids, polychaetes and fishes showed no significant annual variations. When the study area was divided geographically, horizontal variability in abundance within each year showed no significance in total abundance, abundances of copepods, euphausiids, amphipods and fishes, but significance in salps, polychaetes and chaetognaths. Results of site clustering based on covariances of abundances of eleven major taxa were well matched, though not perfect, with the distribution of surface water temperatures which could be used as a tracer of source water masses suggesting that spatial variation was related to hydrodynamic conditions. Factor analyses showed that annual and spatial variations in abundance were mainly caused by only two taxa, Metridia gerlachei and salps (mostly Salpa thompsoni). These two taxa were responsible for about 60% and 30% of total variance, respectively, and were useful indicators of the interannual variation. That is, 1988 and 1989 were the years of M. gerlachei, and 1990 was the year of salps. From vertically stratified MOCNESS samples, it was shown that the major taxa in this study area were active vertical migrators. While most samples obtained by relatively shallow tows (uppermost 100 m depth) were composed of exclusively one or two taxa, those from relatively deep tows (down to 200 m) showed various patterns of vertical stratification suggesting that the patterns of vertical migration were species specific. Species specific ontogenetic vertical migration associated with elevated habitat temperatures also seemed to be responsible for the annual variation in zooplankton distribution in the upper water column.																	0722-4060					MAY	1993	13	4					215	225									WOS:A1993LC53500001

Here, we quantify the changing circumpolar distributions of Antarctic krill, based on the CHINARE 2013/14 circum-Antarctic expedition, plus independent analyses of compiled abundance data (KRILLBASE: 1926-2016). In the 1920s-1930s, average krill densities in the Atlantic-Bellingshausen sector were eight times those in the other sectors. More recently, however, the concentration factor has dropped to only about twofold. This reflects a rebalancing broadly commensurate with climatic forcing: krill densities declined in the Atlantic-Bellingshausen sector which has warmed and lost sea ice, densities may have increased in the Ross-Pacific sector which showed the opposite climatic trend, while densities showed no significant changes in the more stable Lazarev-Indian sectors. Such changes would impact circumpolar food webs, so to better define these we examined circumpolar trends of isotopic values in krill and other zooplankton based on the CHINARE cruise and a literature meta-analysis. Krill delta N-15 values ranged significantly between sectors from 2.21 parts per thousand (Indian) to 3.59 parts per thousand (Ross-Pacific), about half a trophic level lower than another key euphausiid,Thysanoessa macrura. These isoscapes form a baseline for interpreting the reliance of predators on euphausiids, within the varying food webs around the continent. Overall, we suggest that the Indo-Pacific sector has acted as a refuge for the circumpolar krill stock while conditions for them deteriorated rapidly in the Atlantic sector.

Mark; Seeyave, Sophie; Lucas, Mike I.; Fielding, Sophie; Ward, Peter			Phytoplankton community composition around the Crozet Plateau, with emphasis on diatoms and Phaeocystis	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY												Phytoplankton community composition has important implications for upper-ocean biogeochemistry and export production. The species composition of the phytoplankton community (diatoms, Phaeocystis antarctica) was examined around the Crozet Plateau (Southern Ocean) during the CROZEX project in order to address spatial changes in species composition. Phytoplankton biomass was dominated by P. antarctica to the north of the Crozet Plateau, while south of the plateau a diverse community including several large diatom species (e.g., Corethron pennatum) occurred. The phytoplankton community in the vicinity of the Crozet Plateau and Crozet islands included a mixture of P. antarctica and Thalassionema nitzschioides. High numbers of empty diatom frustules characterised many of the sampling sites, with similar species present in the water column as both full and empty cells. Multivariate analysis was used to analyse both the level of similarity between the different sampling sites and the co-occurrence of species. Cluster analysis of the sampling sites showed distinct clusters that differed in terms of species composition and environmental parameters. Recurrent species analysis showed groupings which relate to phytoplankton cell size; groupings separated (i) small (similar to 15 mu m) diatom species, (ii) medium (similar to 35 mu m) and large (similar to 90 mu m) diatom species as well as P. antarctica colonies, and (iii) giant (similar to 300 mu m) diatoms. The abundance and distribution of the different floral groups identified by multivariate analysis are linked to the different environmental regimes, although the relationships are different for small and large species due to the interaction between factors important for phytoplankton growth (e.g., light, nutrients, iron) and mortality (e.g., grazing).

Many attempts have been made to establish spatial associations between seabirds and their prey, yet small-scale (<1 km) proximate association is rarely found. In this paper, we review past attempts to examine spatial proximity, and provide yet another attempt which introduces the concept of a feeding cluster or association of birds. We show, using data collected on acoustic surveys in the neighborhood of the Pribilof Islands, Alaska, during September 1994 to 1997, that larger clusters (>10 birds) of piscivorous murres (Unia spp.) and puff ins (Fraterculla spp.) are consistently associated with their major prey in this area, large shoals of Age-0 pollock Theragra chalcogramma. Furthermore, the number of birds in a bird cluster is usually proportional to the biomass of fish under that cluster.

This process is considered to diminish disc pressure on inflamed nerve roots, resulting in the alleviation of sciatic pain. In the present study two krill (Euphasia superba) enzyme preparations, a proteinase and an esterase preparation, were evaluated for their potential as chemonucleolytic agents. Initially, their ability to degrade several protein (azocoll, casein, proteoglycans, PGs) and peptide (CBZ-arg-4-nitroanilide, CBZ-lys-thiobenzyl ester) substrates was assessed in vitro. The krill proteinase preparation rapidly converted azocoll, casein and PGs to small peptides. Furthermore, when this degradative enzyme preparation was evaluated in vivo, a relatively low intradiscal dose (0.54 mg/disc) was found to reduce intervertebral disc widths in beagles to 48% +/- 10.5% (mean +/- SEM) of their pre-injection values within 2 weeks of administration. Moreover, the discs injected with this proteinase had reconstituted up to 80% +/- 9% (mean +/- SEM) of their pre-injection widths at the termination of the experiment (32 weeks). These data suggest that the krill protease preparation has potential as a chemonucleolytic agent which would allow disc matrix reconstitution, Conversely, the krill esterase preparation also degraded PGs, but into relatively large fragments. This limited digestion of PGs indicates that the krill esterase would be a less effective chemonucleolytic agent than the corresponding proteinase.

Here, we present an analysis of AMW occurrence patterns based on a 9-year passive acoustic dataset (2008-2016) from 21 locations throughout the Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean (Weddell Sea). AMWs were detected acoustically at all mooring locations from May to December, with the highest presence between August and November (bio-duck calls present at more than 80% of days). At the southernmost recording locations, the bio-duck call was present up to 10 months of the year. Substantial inter-annual variation in the seasonality of vocal activity correlated to variation in local ice concentration. Our analysis indicates that part of the AMW population stays in the Weddell Sea during austral winter. The period with the highest acoustic presence in the Weddell Sea (September-October) coincides with the timing of the breeding season of AMW in lower latitudes. The bio-duck call could therefore play a role in mating, although other behavioural functions of the call cannot be excluded to date.

A total of 640 laying hens (Lohmann Brown), which were each 25 weeks old, were divided into 4 dietary treatment groups. Each treatment consisted of 8 replications with 20 laying hens per replication. The treatments were corn-soybean meal basal diet (CS), CS with 7.5% cassava meal (low-pigment; LP), and LP with 1.5 or 3% krill meal. All dietary treatments were formulated to be isocaloric (2,750 kcal/kg metabolizable energy) and isonitrogenous (17.5% crude protein). Birds were raised in an evaporative cooling system house for 8 weeks (25-33 weeks of age). Water was provided ad libitum and feed was provided according to breed requirement recommendations. The LP diets supplemented with krill meal had no effect on production performance and egg quality compared to those of the CS group (P> 0.05). However, the LP diet caused a significant reduction in yolk color score, and astaxanthin, vitamin A, and vitamin E contents of egg yolk (P<0.05). However, the contents of these nutrients increased as the level of krill meal was increased in the diets (P <0.05). The highest yolk color score, and astaxanthin, vitamin A, and vitamin E contents were observed in laying hens fed 3% krill meal (P<0.05). The LP diet had no effect on n-3 fatty acid content; however, a significant reduction in the content of n-6 fatty acids, especially linoleic acid was observed (P< 0.05). Further reduction occurred when higher level of krill was used in the diets (P< 0.05). An increase in krill meal level significantly increased docosahexaenoic acid but not linolenic acid content of egg yolk. Krill meal, therefore, could be used to produce docosahexaenoic acid and antioxidant enriched eggs.																	1346-7395	1349-0486				JUL	2020	57	3					192	199		10.2141/jpsa.0190019							WOS:000551559300002	32733152					
J	Zhou, XQ; Zhu, GP; Hu, S				Zhou, Xiangqian; Zhu, Guoping; Hu, Song			Influence of tides on mass transport in the Bransfield Strait and the adjacent areas, Antarctic	POLAR SCIENCE												The Bransfield Strait and the adjacent areas is a high-productivity region for polar biological resources in the Antarctic. Physical oceanographic processes produce strong ecosystem dynamics via mass transport and water exchange. However, few studies have focused on these processes from coast to shelf and across slopes by tidal dynamics. Therefore, a numerical model was implemented with a high resolution to simulate the influence of the tide on mass transport. The output of the model indicated that the tidal residual current produced by the diurnal tide is dominant and primarily distributed along with the shelf break and near the coast, and water stratification amplifies this residual current system. Water exchange processes were evaluated utilizing passive tracer dyes to demonstrate the influence of the tides on the channel and bay. The tracer residence time ranged from a few days to a week and was affected by the considered representative region's topography and area. Correspondingly, Lagrangian particles tracking method is also used to illustrate the mass transportation, which primarily move along the isobaths on the slope but spiral on the flat shelf. All experiments conducted herein indicate that tidal dynamics is indispensable in this region when studying cross-shelf mass transport.

J	Papot, C; Cascella, K; Toullec, JY; Jollivet, D				Papot, Claire; Cascella, Kevin; Toullec, Jean-Yves; Jollivet, Didier			Divergent ecological histories of two sister Antarctic krill species led to contrasted patterns of genetic diversity in their heat-shock protein (hsp70) arsenal	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION												The Arctic and the Antarctic Peninsula are currently experiencing some of the most rapid rates of ocean warming on the planet. This raises the question of how the initial adaptation to extreme cold temperatures was put in place and whether or not directional selection has led to the loss of genetic variation at key adaptive systems, and thus polar species' (re) adaptability to higher temperatures. In the Southern Ocean, krill represents the most abundant fauna and is a critical member at the base of the Antarctic food web. To better understand the role of selection in shaping current patterns of polymorphisms, we examined genetic diversity of the cox-1 and hsp70 genes by comparing two closely related species of Euphausiid that differ in ecology. Results on mtcox-1 agreed with previous studies, indicating high and similar effective population sizes. However, a coalescent-based approach on hsp70 genes highlighted the role of positive selection and past demographic changes in their recent evolution. Firstly, some form of balancing selection was acting on the inducible isoform C, which reflected the maintenance of an ancestral adaptive polymorphism in both species. Secondly, E. crystallorophias seems to have lost most of its hsp70 diversity because of a population crash and/or directional selection to cold. Nonsynonymous diversities were always greater in E. superba, suggesting that it might have evolved under more heterogeneous conditions. This can be linked to species' ecology with E. superba living in more variable pelagic conditions, while E. crystallorophias is strictly associated with continental shelves and sea ice.

J	Avila, TR; Machado, AAD; Bianchini, A				Avila, Tatiana Ramos; de Souza Machado, Anderson Abel; Bianchini, Adalto			Chitobiase of planktonic crustaceans from South Atlantic coast (Southern Brazil): Characterization and influence of abiotic parameters on enzyme activity	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY												Chitobiase is one of the enzymes involved in chitin degradation in nature. It is produced and released by a variety of organisms from bacteria to fish. In crustaceans, it is associated with digestive function and acts on the epidermis during the molting process. In the present study, the influence of water pH, temperature and salinity on maximum chitobiase activity (MCA), as well as the enzyme affinity (Km) for a substrate, the methylumbelliferyl N-acetyl-beta-o-glucosaminide (MUFNAG) was evaluated in the copepod Acartia tonsa. Km values for chitobiases of other crustaceans from the Patos Lagoon estuary and Cassino Beach (Southern Brazil) were also determined. For A. tonsa, MCA was observed at pH 5-6 and 30-35 degrees C. The range of pH was quite similar to that reported for other aquatic organisms. However, the range of temperature was lower than that previously reported. For salinity, no previous studies have considered the influence of this parameter on MCA. For A. tonsa, MCA was observed in freshwater, showing a significant linear decrease with increasing salinity. Considering that maximum copepod survival and growth rates are observed between 15 and 25 ppt, these findings suggest that the observed enzyme activity in this range of salinity (68 to 47% of that measured in freshwater) is not a limiting factor for A. tonsa growth. However, the extremely decreased enzyme activity observed in salinity 30 ppt (33% of that measured in freshwater) suggests that chitobiase activity might be one of the limiting factor for copepod growth at 30 ppt salinity or higher. Km values (mu M) determined for organisms evaluated in the present study (copepod A. tonsa = 20.77; mysid Metamysidopsis elongata atlantica = 14.67; nauplii barnacle Balanus improvisus = 18.19; decapod zoea = 14.30; decapod megalopa = 24.77) were lower than those reported for other crustaceans from Northern Hemisphere. Also, they were much lower than those of organisms from different taxonomic groups like bacteria and fungi, but much higher than in protozoans and dinoflagelates. These findings suggest that chitobiase might be differentially evolved in each specific group of organism, and even within different ontogenetic stages of the same species, for a better adaptation to cope with its respective environmental needs.

Generalised linear models were used to develop predictive models of crabeater seal Lobodon carcinophaga distribution during the breeding season in relation to physical-oceanographic and ice-cover variables. Models were constructed from data collected on shipboard surveys in the pack-ice off east Antarctica between 50 and 115 degrees E from 1985 to 1987, and were tested from surveys in the same region from 1995 to 1997. Models of presence selected ocean depth as the only significant physical-oceanographic predictor variable for both breeding and non-breeding seals. Seals were most likely to be present on the ice at moderate ocean depths of approximately 2500 m. Unlike non-breeding seals, breeding seals were all but absent on the ice associated with depths of > 4000 m. The predicted distribution of presence comprised a band delineated by the shelf-break to the south and extending northwards for 1.5 to 5 degrees latitude, with non-breeding seals having a more northerly limit than breeding seals. This band is coincident with the known distribution of the crabeater seals' primary food source (Antarctic krill), and also coincides with frontal features such as the Antarctic slope front and the southern boundary of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current, which are considered to be areas of enhanced primary and secondary productivity. The presence-depth models were improved by the inclusion of ice-cover variables. Breeding seals may avoid areas with a high proportion of all ice as floes < 20 m in size, because the chance of successfully weaning a pup in such areas is low.																	0171-8630	1616-1599					2005	299						297	309		10.3354/meps299297							WOS:000232469700027

The recovery of these populations will be affected by the availability of krill, a major dietary component, in the Southern Ocean. We combine a novel energetics model for baleen whales with a state dependent foraging model to explore the impacts of an expanding krill fishery on baleen whales. We parameterize the model for blue whales, but with simple modifications it could be applied to most baleen whales. We predict that an expanding fishery will have a small but significant impact on the blue whale population through decreased birth rates. However, spreading the catch limit throughout the range of krill can reduce these effects. In addition, whales may be able to reduce these impacts through adaptive changes in foraging behavior. The relationship between krill abundance and blue whale foraging and reproductive success is nonlinear, such that larger reductions in krill biomass, potentially following a loss of sea ice due to climate change, could have a much larger negative impact on the recovery of blue whales.

The measurement system consists of a 70 kHz split-beam system and a video camera system to observe the orientation of animals. The transducer was set pointing downward on the top of the small tank with a window on one of the side walls for observing orientation. TS measurement and orientation observation are performed simultaneously. This system can avoid external disturbances such as wind and waves and be set up easily for measurements including measurement on board a ship. TS measurement for a physical model (copper cylinder) was conducted and the measured TS was in good agreement with the theoretical result, showing the accuracy of our method. Next, TS measurements of live shrimps were conducted to get detailed TS patterns. We compared the measured results with the theoretical TS patterns and confirmed a reasonable agreement.

J	Kibirige, I; Perissinotto, R; Nozais, C				Kibirige, I; Perissinotto, R; Nozais, C			Grazing rates and feeding preferences of the mysid shrimp Gastrosaccus brevifissura in a temporarily open estuary in South Africa	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												Gastrosaccus brevifissura is a key crustacean species in most South African estuaries. The biomass, distribution, grazing rates and feeding preferences of this species were investigated in the Mpenjati Estuary, on the east coast of South Africa. The species exhibits a very marked diurnal migration behaviour, with biomass varying within the range 0.005 to 0.26 g m(-3) dry wt (DW) during the daytime and 0.002 to 1.53 g m-3 DW during the night. The estimated total population grazing impact of the mysid ranged between 22 and 32% of the available phytoplankton in summer and winter, respectively. This suggests that G. brevifissura may not meet all its metabolic demands by consuming phytoplankton alone. Other possible food sources available in the estuary include plant detritus (DTR), microheterotrophs and benthic microalgae (BMA). In particular, the vertical migration behaviour of G. brevifissura allows close spatial association with the benthic microalgae during most of the day. Indeed, feeding experiments suggest that G. brevifissura is able to feed efficiently on settled as well as on resuspended benthic microalgae. This is supported by results from stable isotope analysis (delta(13)C and delta(15)N), which show that benthic microalgae contribute 68 and 24% to the total diet of G. brevifissura in winter and summer, respectively. This also suggests that other food sources are needed by this species to meet all its energetic demands. Carbon rations obtained from in situ grazing methods are 35 to 44% (winter) and 1.6 to 3.9% (summer). When these values are compared to the previously estimated basal metabolic requirements for the mysid, it follows that G. brevifissura is able to meet all its energetic requirements from a pure autotrophic diet only during the winter. On the other hand, during summer, these values are barely enough to meet the basal metabolic rate of this species.																	0171-8630	1616-1599					2003	251						201	210		10.3354/meps251201							WOS:000182917300017						
J	Reid, TA; Hindell, MA				Reid, TA; Hindell, MA			Coarse-scale relationships between seabirds and zooplankton off south-eastern Tasmania	MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH												Observations were made of seabird and zooplankton distribution in the waters adjacent to south-eastern Tasmania to examine correspondence at coarse scales (tens of kilometres). The distribution of seabirds was related mainly to changes in the water depth (and distance from land) over the length of the transect, whereas the distribution of zooplankton related to temporal changes. Significantly different associations of seabird species occurred in Storm Bay (mainly species breeding within the bay), and over the shelf-edge (with many non-breeding species dominant). Zooplankton diversity varied during the study, being greatest at the beginning (May) and end (September) of the study. Little correspondence was found between the distribution of seabirds and zooplankton at the community level, but there were significant relationships for several species, such as diving petrels and gannets. The lack of an overall correspondence between seabirds and zooplankton may have been due to the patchiness of seabird and zooplankton distribution, limits to the requirements of seabirds to find maximum prey densities (instead only needing to find 'enough'), the lack of certainty about whether seabirds were foraging when observed, and behavioural interactions among seabirds.

Differences in the quantity of total lipid between sites were pronounced for R. gigas; females from a station near South Georgia where a bloom was in progress contained similar to 8 times as much as those sampled in post-bloom waters in the Polar Frontal Zone (PFZ) some 450 km further north. In contrast, differences between sites for C. simillimus were less pronounced. The main lipid class for R. gigas was wax ester and for C. simillimus triacylglycerol. This fundamental difference is thought to reflect varying life-history patterns suggesting that C. simillimus may not undergo periods of pronounced food shortage. Pristane, a metabolite of phytol derived through the degradation of chlorophyll, was present in both species at both sites, indicating recent feeding activity, but the lack of the polyene diatom marker C-21:6 in C. simillimus at the PFZ station suggested that it was largely feeding on other microplankton. Fatty acid analysis of C. simillimus offered further evidence that this species was omnivorous and that R. gigas was predominantly herbivorous. 16:0 and 16:1 generally accounted for slightly >50% of total fatty acids in both species; however, 16:0 was proportionately more abundant in C. simillimus and 16:1 in R. gigas. The 16:1/16:0 ratio is usually >1 in diatoms, suggesting that the diet of C. simillimus contained items of prey other than diatoms, a fact confirmed in grazing experiments.																	0142-7873					AUG	1996	18	8					1439	1454		10.1093/plankt/18.8.1439							WOS:A1996VE80800012						
J	Pakhomov, EA; Froneman, PW				Pakhomov, EA; Froneman, PW			Zooplankton dynamics in the eastern Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean during the austral summer 1997/1998 - Part 1: Community structure	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY												Zooplankton abundance, biomass and community structure in the top 300m layer were studied along the 6degreesE meridian between 49 and 65degreesS during a Scandinavian/South African Joint Global Ocean Flux Study (December 1997-January 1998) onboard the S.A. Agulhas. Along the transect, total abundance and biomass of zooplankton ranged from 8 to 384 ind m(-3) and 1.4 to 64.1 mg DW m(-3), respectively. The general pattern in zooplankton distribution observed was an increase in density between Spring Ice Edge and the Antarctic Polar Front (APF) regions. Copepods numerically dominated zooplankton along the entire transect accounting for 68-97% of the total abundance and 24-90% of the total zooplankton standing stock. Other important contributors to total biomass, particularly within the Winter Ice Edge (WIE) and APF regions, were cnidarians and ctenophores (up to 50%), pteropods (up to 35%), tunicates (up to 30%), chaetognaths (up to 25%) and euphausiids (up to 23%). Numerical analyses identified three major zooplankton groupings, coinciding with the three regions of investigation. A dramatic change in the zooplankton composition occurred at the APF region as several copepod and euphausiid species were found on either side of the front only. A second change in the species composition was observed at the WIE, emphasizing the ecological importance of the frontal zone associated with the winter ice edge. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

Effects of krill oil/krill protein ratio on properties of microcapsules were investigated. With increased ratio, crude protein of microcapsules decreased, while total lipid increased. Although microcapsule oil loading capacity increased, loading and encapsulation efficiencies decreased. Thin layer chromatography (TLC) confirmed abundance of phospholipids, which are amphiphilic; and thus, resulted in stable emulsion (emulsion stability index). Microcapsules contained omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) at 43-60, including eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) at 28-41 and 9-11 g/100g of total FAs, respectively. SDS-PAGE electrophoresis revealed proteolysis of ISP krill protein, probably causing reduced loading and encapsulation efficiencies. SEM showed that krill oil/krill protein ratio affected surface microstructure. ISP krill protein showed potential as a wall material to microencapsulate krill oil; and thus, expand application of krill oil/protein for human consumption.

Drivers of concentrated predation in an Antarctic marginal-ice-zone food web	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS												Predators impact preyscapes (3-D distribution of forage species) by consuming prey according to their abilities or by altering prey behavior as they avoid being consumed. We elucidate prey (Antarctic silverfish[Pleuragramma antarctica] and crystal krill[Euphausia chrystallorophias]) responses to predation associated with the marginal ice zone (MIZ) of the McMurdo Sound, Antarctica, polynya. Prey abundance and habitat was sampled across a 30 x 15km area by remotely-operated vehicle, and included locations that were accessible (ice edge) or inaccessible (solid fast ice) to air-breathing predators. Prey and habitat sampling coincided with bio-logging of Adelie penguins and observations of other air-breathing predators (penguins, seals, and whales), all of which were competing for the same prey. Adelie penguins dived deeper, and more frequently, near the ice edge. Lowered abundance of krill at the ice edge indicated they were depleted or were responding to increased predation and/or higher light levels along the ice edge. Penguin diet shifted increasingly to silverfish from krill during sampling, and was correlated with the arrival of krill-eating whales. Behaviorally-mediated, high trophic transfer characterizes the McMurdo Sound MIZ, and likely other MIZs, warranting more specific consideration in food web models and conservation efforts.																	2045-2322					APR 29	2020	10	1							7282	10.1038/s41598-020-63875-y							WOS:000560743900002	32350362

This study focusses on trophic interactions between two sympatric mysids Praunus flexuosus and Neomysis integer of the Elbe Estuary, northern Germany. Based on an experimental approach, intraguild predation was evaluated. Predation rate of P. flexuosus on N. integer was positively related to predator size and temperature. Predation rate was significantly correlated with prey size, juvenile N. integer released just from the mysid marsupium being most vulnerable. However, adult R flexuosus were able to gain more energy in terms of body carbon by catching larger N. integer, whereas immature R flexuosus assimilated more energy by capturing large numbers of the small-sized N. integer. In contrast to N. integer, R flexuosus showed an efficient escape behaviour that prevented all stages of N. integer from preying on any size class of P. flexuosus. When Eurytemora affinis was offered as prey, both N. integer and P. flexuosus increased predation rates with predator size and temperature. In mixed prey (N. integer and E. affinis) experiments at 10 degreesC, predation rates of adult P. flexuosus on N. integer released just from the marsupium declined from 17 +/- 8 to 6 +/- 4 N. integer mysid(-1) day(-1). We conclude that intraguild predation exists between the two species but is one sided with small N. integer being strongly suppressed. This heavy predation pressure is modified by the addition of alternative food resources, in this case, E. affinis. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Two beta-hexosaminidases were obtained from the hepatopancreas of the Northern shrimp Pandalus borealis by ion-exchange chromatography, gel filtration and hydrophobic interaction chromatography. According to the substrate specificities, both enzymes are beta-N-acetylhexosaminidases (EC 3.2.1.52), designated forms I and II. 2. The two enzyme forms have an absolute requirement for the N-acetylated sugar moiety and the beta-glycosidic linkage, and showed no significant difference in the preference for the 4-C-epimer of glucose over galactose. 3. Form II is more efficient hydrolyzing the di-, tri- and tetramer of N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosamine than form I. 4.

Accounting for seasonal and composition-related variability in acoustic material properties in estimating copepod and krill target strength	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY-METHODS												Estimation of abundance or biomass, using acoustic techniques requires knowledge of the frequency dependent acoustic backscatter characteristics, or target strength, of organisms. Target strength of zooplankton is typically estimated from physics-based models that involve multiple parameters, notably including the acoustic material properties (i.e., the contrasts in density and sound speed between the animal and surrounding seawater). In this work, variability in the acoustic material properties of two zooplankton species in the Gulf of Maine, the copepod (Calanus finmarchicus) and krill (Meganyctiphanes norvegica), was investigated relative to changing season as well as, for the copepod, temperature and depth. Increases in the density and sound speed contrasts of these species from fall to spring were observed. Target strength predictions based on these measurements varied between fall and spring by 2-3 dB in krill. Measurements were also conducted on C. finmarchicus lipid extract at changing temperature and pressure. The density contrast of the extract varied negatively with temperature, while the sound speed contrast changed by more than 10 % over the temperature and pressure ranges that the organism expected to occupy. C. finmarchicus target strength predictions showed that the combined effect of temperature and pressure can be significant (more than 10 dB) due to the varying response of lipids. The large vertical migration ranges and lipid accumulation characteristics of these species (e.g., the diapause behaviour of Calanus copepods) suggest that it is necessary for seasonal and environmental variability in material properties to be taken into account to achieve reliable measurements.

This paper describes an effort to quantify these variabilities at fine temporal and spatial scales during a three-day experiment at a fixed location, using high-resolution, stratified Bioness samples and echo-integration, and assuming a fixed distribution of krill orientations. Night-time catches in the krill scattering layer (SL) were 15 times the acoustic estimates. The situation was reversed during daytime, when the acoustic estimates in the SL were 5 times larger than the catches. This collectively resulted in a +/- 10-dB gradual diel cycle in the difference of vertically integrated biomass from both sampling methods. Use of a strobe light on the Bioness reduced avoidance of the net by krill and significantly increased (x10) daytime catches in the SL, but had no significant effect on night-time catches. The difference in volume-backscattering strength at 120 and 38 kHz (Delta S(v120-38)) in the densest parts of the SL agreed with predictions using a target-strength (TS) model and an assumed normal distribution of tilt (mean theta = 11 degrees; s.d. = 4 degrees). The Delta S(v120-38) was smaller for lower densities and during night-time. It appears that the theta and, therefore, TS distributions of krill significantly change during their diel vertical migrations. At twilight and at night, when they are feeding and swimming vertically, they exhibit lower mean TS and Delta S(v120-38) and react less to strong strobe-light pulses, in contrast to daytime. Diel patterns in TS and net avoidance should be taken into account in krill-biomass assessments that use round the clock acoustic-survey data and multi-frequency TS models for target classification.

J	Ju, SJ; Secor, DH; Harvey, HR				Ju, SJ; Secor, DH; Harvey, HR			Growth rate variability and lipofuscin accumulation rates in the blue crab Callinectes sapidus	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												To better understand growth and age-pigment (lipofuscin) accumulation rates of the blue crab Callinectes sapidus under natural conditions, juveniles (33 to 94 mm carapace width) were reared in outdoor ponds for over 1 yr. Growth rates, measured by carapace width, during summer and fall exceeded all those reported in the literature; the initial carapace width of 59 +/- 14 mm (mean +/- SD) increased to 164 +/- 15 mm within a 3 mo period. No growth occurred during winter months (November to April) at low water temperatures. Growth rates of crabs in ponds were substantially higher (von Bertalanffy growth parameter K = 1.09) than those of crabs held in laboratory environments, and than rate estimates for natural populations of mid-Atlantic blue crabs. Model comparisons indicated that seasonalized von Bertalanffy growth models (r(2) > 0.9) provide a better fit than the non-seasonalized model (r(2) = 0.74) for pond-reared crabs and, by implication, are more appropriate for field populations. Despite growth rates that varied strongly with season, lipofuscin (normalized to protein concentration) accumulation rate was nearly constant throughout the year. Although the lipofuscin level in pond-reared crabs was significantly correlated with size (carapace width), it was more closely correlated with chronological age. Lipofuscin accumulation rates were also similar to those observed for laboratory-reared crabs, despite very large differences in growth rates and temperature regimes. The constancy of normalized-lipofuscin accumulation rates of blue crabs across seasons and environmental conditions suggests that lipofuscin concentration can be a more robust indicator of age than carapace width alone.

This affects the ocean productivity which consecutively impacts plankton communities and polar top predators like penguins. Yet, the underlying behavioural and physiological mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here we monitored the ecophysiological responses of Adelie penguin (Pygoscelis adeliae) pairs during two seasons of contrasting timing of sea-ice retreat. Beside classical breeding parameters like foraging trip duration, body mass and reproductive success, we also investigated food-related stress (via plasma corticosterone concentration), nutritional state (via metabolite levels) and the use of penguins' habitat (via blood isotopic values). Body mass and reproductive success remained unchanged but foraging trips were shorter when sea-ice retreated earlier. Constant plasma corticosterone concentrations indicated that none of the feeding conditions resulted in a food-related stress. However metabolite levels were lower when sea-ice retreated early, suggesting that the foraging performance and the quality/quantity of food differed. Indeed isotopic ratios indicated that coastal prey like fish contributed more to the penguins' diet when sea-ice retreated prematurely. The early sea-ice retreat was related to higher chlorophyll concentrations, known to favour krill recruitment. Paradoxically, this was not associated to a higher krill contribution in the penguins' diet. We propose that a shift in the phytoplankton quality (rather than quantity), affecting krill recruitment, forced penguins to switch to more available prey like coastal fish. In some Antarctic regions, sea-ice is retreating earlier and earlier. In the present study, even though the timing of sea-ice retreat and the consecutive ocean productivity differed drastically between the 2 years, Adelie penguins were not severely affected because they were able to adjust their at-sea behaviour and thus maintained their body condition and reproductive success unchanged. This suggests that the timing of sea-ice retreat does not represent an important threat to populations of Adelie penguins at least as long as alternative resources are still available and other environmental parameters like winter sea-ice extent are not dramatically altered.

Long-term observations from Antarctica demonstrate that mismatched scales of fisheries management and predator-prey interaction lead to erroneous conclusions about precaution	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS												Low catch limits for forage species are often considered to be precautionary measures that can help conserve marine predators. Difficulties measuring the impacts of fisheries removals on dependent predators maintain this perspective, but consideration of the spatio-temporal scales over which forage species, their predators, and fisheries interact can aid assessment of whether low catch limits are as precautionary as presumed. Antarctic krill are targeted by the largest fishery in the Southern Ocean and are key forage for numerous predators. Current krill removals are considered precautionary and have not been previously observed to affect krill-dependent predators, like penguins. Using a hierarchical model and 30+ years of monitoring data, we show that expected penguin performance was reduced when local harvest rates of krill were >= 0.1, and this effect was similar in magnitude to that of poor environmental conditions. With continued climate warming and high local harvest rates, future observations of penguin performance are predicted to be below the long-term mean with a probability of 0.77. Catch limits that are considered precautionary for forage species simply because the limit is a small proportion of the species' standing biomass may not be precautionary for their predators.				, Jefferson/AAG-1702-2021	, Jefferson/0000-0002-3600-1414; Watters, George/0000-0002-6989-1273												2045-2322					FEB 11	2020	10	1							2314	10.1038/s41598-020-59223-9							WOS:000562857400006	32047241					
J	HUNTLEY, ME; NORDHAUSEN, W				HUNTLEY, ME; NORDHAUSEN, W			AMMONIUM CYCLING BY ANTARCTIC ZOOPLANKTON IN WINTER	MARINE BIOLOGY												Elemental composition and excretion rates of ammonium-nitrogen of zooplankton, ranging over more than five orders of magnitude in body size, were measured in mid-winter in coastal waters west of the Antarctic Peninsula. Excretion rates were constant for the initial 12 h of incubation in the four species tested, and experimental stocking densities of up to 126 mg dry wt l(-1) did not cause variability in the rate of ammonium production. Weight-specific excretion rates of freshly caught Euchaeta antarctica, Conchoecia sp., Thysnnoessa macrura, Euphausin superba, and early stage copepodites of Metridia gerlachei were not significantly different from those reported in summer. However, adult copepods of M. gerlachei and Calanoides acutus appear to have reduced their nitrogen metabolism during winter. Turnover rates of body nitrogen increased with diminishing size, ranging from < 0.5% body N d(-1) for large E. superba to > 7% body N d(-1) for CII and CIII copepodites of M. gerlachei. Only the nitrogen turnover rates of C. acutus were sufficiently low as to suggest that it could survive the entire austral winter without feeding. Phytoplankton and bacterioplankton were virtually absent in both the water column and the sea-ice. We conclude that carnivory is the dominant trophic mode of the pelagic zooplankton community in Antarctica during winter. Production of ammonium-nitrogen by the zooplankton community probably accounts for < 10% of the total ammonium regenerated prior to the annual spring bloom.																	0025-3162					JAN	1995	121	3					457	467		10.1007/BF00349454							WOS:A1995QG40900006

Investigations into stable isotopic values of krill in predation hotspots arc important in facilitating our understanding of the feeding environments of krill in a local coastal ecosystem. In this study we investigated stable isotopic values and maturity and size composition of krill at a small spatial scale. by logging GPS tracks of five Chinstrap Pygoscelis antarcticus and seven Gentoo P. papua penguins, and analyzing their stomach contents. The study was conducted at a penguin colony on Barton Peninsula, King George Island, Antarctica. The main food item of both species was Antarctic Krill (>98% wet mass). One Chinstrap and four Gentoo penguin foraging trips were classified as "on-shelf" trips, and four Chinstrap and three Gentoo Penguin foraging trips Were classified as off shelf trips. Krill collected from off-shelf trips had higher delta N-15 (4.22 +/- 0.28 parts per thousand) values than those from on-shelf trips (3.78 +/- 0.29 parts per thousand). The delta C-13 of the krill samples did not differ between the two penguin species or between trip types. The proportion of juvenile krill taken was higher for Chinstrap (13.04 +/- 4.97%) than Gentoo penguins (3.33 +/- 2.43%). Our results suggest that the main food source of the krill in our sample originated as non benthic planktonic/suspended organic matter; and that krill in off-shelf habitat may occasionally consume higher trophic level prey compared to those in on-shelf habitats.																	1347-0558					JAN	2015	14	1					13	20		10.2326/osj.14.13							WOS:000349459700003

At each station we sampled the upper mixed (UL), the middle (ML), and the deeper layers (DL) bounded by hydrological gradients. Diel migrations were significantly different south and north of the PF in terms of total abundance, biomass, diversity and individual taxa density. In both seasons, mesoplankton dielly migrated between the ML/DL and the UL north of the PF and between layers below 300 m and the DL and ML south of the PF. Deeper range of diel migrations south of the PF was coupled with a general mesoplankton descent in summer period compared to spring. Conversely, north of the PF, mesoplankton ascended to upper layers in summer, which was mirrored in lesser depths of diel migrations. The differences in the plankton distribution on both sides of the PF are likely associated with variations of vertical distribution of phytoplankton. Some abundant taxa such as Aetideus sp. and Oithona plumifera showed both common (nighttime ascend) and inverted (nighttime descend) vertical migrations depending on season and position related to the PF.

These motivations have been proposed for schools of Antarctic krill, but little is known about their three-dimensional structure. Stereophotogrammetric images of Antarctic krill schooling in the laboratory are used to determine statistical distributions of swimming speed, nearest neighbor distance, and three-dimensional nearest neighbor positions. The krill schools swim at speeds of two body lengths per second at nearest neighbor distances of one body length and reach similarly high levels of organization as fish schools. The nearest neighbor position distribution is highly anisotropic and shows that Antarctic krill prefer to swim in the propulsion jet of their anterior neighbor. This position promotes communication and coordination among schoolmates via hydrodynamic signals within the pulsed jet created by the metachronal stroking of the neighboring krill's pleopods. The hydrodynamic communication channel therefore plays a large role in structuring the school. Further, Antarctic krill avoid having a nearest neighbor directly overhead, possibly to avoid blockage of overhead light needed for orientation. Other factors, including the elongated body shape of Antarctic krill and potential energy savings, also may help determine the three dimensional spatial structure of tightly packed krill schools.

J	Vanucci, S; Bruni, V				Vanucci, S; Bruni, V			Small nanoplankton and bacteria in the Western Ross Sea during sea-ice retreat (spring 1994)	POLAR BIOLOGY												Spatial changes of small nanoplankton (2-10 mu m) were investigated in relation to sea-ice conditions, hydrography and receding ice processes in the Ross Sea (Antarctica) during spring 1994. Abundance and biomass of heterotrophic and autotrophic nanoplankton, as well as bacterioplankton, were determined along a south-north transect from the open waters polynya towards the pack ice. Autotrophic and heterotrophic nanoplankton biomass ranged from 758 to 4570 mgC m(-2) and from 3 to 387 mgC m(-2), respectively. Heterotrophic nanoplankton accounted, on average, for about 9% of the total (i.e. autotrophic plus heterotrophic) nanoplankton biomass, The size structure of both auto- and heterotrophic nanoplankton in the Ross Sea continental shelf receding ice edge was different from that of nanoplankton associated with the shelf break and open Antarctic ice-edge area. Generally, the highest heterotrophic biomass was found in the pack-ice zone on the continental shelf, while the highest heterotrophic contribution to the total nanoplankton biomass (up to 25%) was encountered at the shelf break where phytoplankton was largely dominated by 2- to 3-mu m-size cells.																	0722-4060					NOV	1999	22	5					311	321		10.1007/s003000050424							WOS:000083378800003

The system transmits a linear frequency modulated signal with a frequency sweep of 20-220 kHz. To increase the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), a very long ( 50 ms) signal is used, and pulse compression processing is applied to received echoes. To determine the accuracy and effectiveness of the system and method, the obtained measurements were compared with predictions by theoretical acoustic scattering models. According to the verification experiment for a sphere and cylinders, the mean absolute errors were < 0.30 dB and the correlation coefficients r were > 0.97 in the frequency range above 20-dB SNR (40-210 kHz for the cylinders). Our measurement system was thus very accurate. We then performed the experiment for a commercially important shrimp, sakura shrimp Lucensosergia lucens. The measured spectra of three samples (35-38 mm) were in good agreement with the predicted spectra using an assumed sound-speed contrast. The r values were > 0.88 in the frequency range above 20-dB SNR (approximately 110-190 kHz). The effectiveness of our new method for weakly scattering animals was confirmed.																	0919-9268	1444-2906				SEP	2021	87	5					627	638		10.1007/s12562-021-01532-7		AUG 2021					WOS:000682425200001

From 2014 to 2019, during 6 separate research cruises, the dive behavior of 28 individual blue whales was investigated using bio-logging tags (DTAGs), generating approximate to 190 h of data. Whales dove to significantly greater depths during the day compared to nighttime (day: 32.6 +/- 18.7 m; night: 6.2 +/- 2.7 m; P < 0.01). During the night, most time was spent close to the surface (86% +/- 9.4%; P < 0.01) and at depths of less than 12 m. From 2016 to 2019, active acoustics (scientific echosounders) were used to record prey (euphausiids) density and distribution simultaneously with whale diving data. Tagged whales appeared to perform dives relative to the vertical migration of prey during the day. The association between diurnal prey migration and shallow nighttime dive behavior suggests that blue whales are at increased risk of ship collisions during periods of darkness since the estimated maximum ship draft of vessels operating in the region is also approximate to 12 m. In recent decades, northern Chilean Patagonia has seen a large increase in marine traffic due to a boom in salmon aquaculture and the passenger ship industry. Vessel strike risks for large whales are likely underestimated in this region. Results reported in this study may be valuable for policy and mitigation decisions regarding conservation of the endangered blue whale.

Following its establishment in 1982, the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR) has managed the ecosystems of the high seas of the Southern Ocean. CCAMLR pioneered the ecosystem approach to resource management, took action on the problem of sea bird by-catch, and has established measures to combat illegal unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing. CCAMLR is seen as an example of best practice in managing marine resources in international waters. At the same time, CCAMLR's challenges arise in the balance between 'fishing' and 'conservation' interests; for example in the current debates over climate change and marine protected areas in the Southern Ocean. In each of these examples, CCAMLR's consensus-based decision-making process has been a central element in shaping outcomes. This paper considers CCAMLR's achievements in sustainable marine ecosystems and identifies emerging challenges. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Krill faecal pellets drive hidden pulses of particulate organic carbon in the marginal ice zone	NATURE COMMUNICATIONS												The biological carbon pump drives a flux of particulate organic carbon (POC) through the ocean and affects atmospheric levels of carbon dioxide. Short term, episodic flux events are hard to capture with current observational techniques and may thus be underrepresented in POC flux estimates. We model the potential hidden flux of POC originating from Antarctic krill, whose swarming behaviour could result in a major conduit of carbon to depth through their rapid exploitation of phytoplankton blooms and bulk egestion of rapidly sinking faecal pellets (FPs). Our model results suggest a seasonal krill FP export flux of 0.039 GT C across the Southern Ocean marginal ice zone, corresponding to 17-61% (mean 35%) of current satellite-derived export estimates for this zone. The magnitude of our conservatively estimated flux highlights the important role of large, swarming macrozooplankton in POC export and, the need to incorporate such processes more mechanistically to improve model projections.

Glacial melting: an overlooked threat to Antarctic krill	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS												Strandings of marine animals are relatively common in marine systems. However, the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. We observed mass strandings of krill in Antarctica that appeared to be linked to the presence of glacial meltwater. Climate-induced glacial meltwater leads to an increased occurrence of suspended particles in the sea, which is known to affect the physiology of aquatic organisms. Here, we study the effect of suspended inorganic particles on krill in relation to krill mortality events observed in Potter Cove, Antarctica, between 2003 and 2012. The experimental results showed that large quantities of lithogenic particles affected krill feeding, absorption capacity and performance after only 24 h of exposure. Negative effects were related to both the threshold concentrations and the size of the suspended particles. Analysis of the stomach contents of stranded krill showed large quantities of large particles ( >10(6) mu m(3)), which were most likely mobilized by glacial meltwater. Ongoing climate-induced glacial melting may impact the coastal ecosystems of Antarctica that rely on krill.				Hass, H.

These differences are addressed through improved understanding of key model parameters. The scattering process was modeled using the distorted-wave Born approximation, representing the shape of the animal as a bent and tapered cylinder. Recently published length-based regressions were used to constrain the sound speed and density contrasts between the animal and the surrounding seawater, rather than the earlier approach of using single values for all lengths. To constrain the parameter governing the orientation of the animal relative to the incident acoustic wave, direct measurements of the orientation of krill in situ were made with a video plankton recorder. In contrast to previous indirect and aquarium-based observations, krill were observed to orient themselves mostly horizontally. Averaging predicted scattering over the measured distribution of orientations resulted in predictions of target strength consistent with in situ measurements of target strength of large krill (mean length 40-43 mm) at four frequencies (43-420 kHz), but smaller than expected under the semi-empirical model traditionally used to estimate krill target strength.

Understanding the variability in the iron concentration of Antarctic krill	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Antarctic krill may play a significant role in the Southern Ocean iron cycle. However, understanding the control on iron budgets by Antarctic krill is hampered by the large range in the reported iron concentration of krill. The aim of this study was to investigate the causes of the large range of iron concentrations in krill reported in the literature (6-190 mg kg(-1)). Antarctic krill samples were collected from three research voyages to Pyrdz Bay, Antarctica, and analysed individually. Iron concentrations were measured using sector field inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry in whole krill specimens and in the isolated stomach, digestive gland, muscle, body (whole krill excluding stomach and digestive gland), exoskeleton and faecal pellets. Iron concentrations in stomach (6-98 mg/kg), digestive gland (14-82 mg kg(-1)), and faecal pellet (683-1039 mg kg(-1)) were higher compared to muscle (4-7 mg kg(-1)), exoskeleton (6-15 mg kg(-1)), and body (4-18 mg kg(-1)) indicating that krill may ingest more iron than they require for physiological processes. Iron concentrations in whole krill from March 2012 (10 +/- 3 mg kg(-1)) were significantly lower compared to February 2003 (19 +/- 7 mg kg(-1)) and February 2015 (18 +/- 12 mg kg(-1)). Overall, the iron concentrations in krill from this study were consistently at the lower end of the published range. We propose that the large range in reported whole iron concentrations of krill can be accounted for by a combination of seasonal and regional differences in sampling, reflecting differences in the quantity and quality of their diet.

Variability in transport pathways on and around the South Georgia shelf, Southern Ocean: Implications for recruitment and retention	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS												The waters around South Georgia are among the most productive in the Southern Ocean, with zooplankton populations close to the island, in particular Antarctic krill, supporting vast colonies of higher predators. However, our understanding of the processes governing variability in the supply of these food resources is limited by the poor spatial and temporal resolution of available data. Here, we use a numerical modeling approach to examine the underlying physical processes driving the recruitment and retention of zooplankton to the South Georgia shelf. Variability in the magnitude and spatial distribution of recruitment was dominated by the proximity and orientation of the southern Antarctic Circumpolar Current front to the shelf edge. Shelf retention was highest for source sites on the southwest shelf, with the main transport routes off the shelf to the north and northwest. Retention was lowest in the austral summer and winter; in summer increased glacial melt drives stronger off-shelf near-surface currents, while in winter, stronger winds lead to an increase in off-shelf transport. Of particular note was the prediction of a significant increase in retention for particles released throughout the shelf in April and July 2000. This period coincided with the development of pronounced anticlockwise shelf flows, associated with horizontal density gradients due to reduced wind mixing of shelf waters, and differences between shelf and oceanic waters, which significantly reduced off-shelf transport rates. Such findings are crucial for understanding the influence of variability in physical processes on the ecosystem at South Georgia.

This article explores the potential to compare three thermodynamically based ecological indicators. The environmental impact of partial replacement of fish meal (FM) and fish oil with alternative ingredients was investigated using energy, classical exergy and eco-exergy analysis. Seven hypothetical feeds were formulated: one with high levels of FM and fish oil, four feeds based on plant ingredients, one containing krill meal, and one based on algae-derived products. Analysis included cultivation of crops and algae, fishing for fish and krill, industrial processing of these ingredients and production of complete fish feed. Because most harvested products are refined in multiple product outputs that have good value to society, two scenarios were compared. In the base case scenario, no allocation of co-products was used and all the environmental costs were ascribed to one specific co-product. Co-product allocation by mass was used in the second scenario; this is considered to be the preferred scenario because it accurately reflects the individual contributions of the co-products to the environmental impact of the feed products. For this scenario, the total energy consumption for a fish-based diet was 14,500 MJ, which was similar to a krill diet (15,600 MJ), about 15-31% higher than plant-based diets, and 9% higher than an algae diet. Substituting FM and fish oil with alternative ingredients resulted in minor changes in total classical exergy degradation (2-16% difference). The calculations based on energy only consider the energy conservation based on the First Law of Thermodynamics, whereas those based on classical exergy also takes the Second Law of Thermodynamics into account; energy that can do work is distinguished from energy that is lost as heat to the environment. The calculations based on eco-exergy consider the total loss of work energy in the environment including the work energy associated with the information embodied in the genomes of organisms. The diet based on fishery-derived ingredients was the highest total work energy consumer compared with plant-based diets (24-30% greater), the diet containing krill meal (25% greater), and the algae diet (four times higher). Thus, reducing FM and fish oil levels in fish feed can contribute significantly to more sustainable aquaculture. In particular, algae-derived products in aquafeeds could drastically decrease environmental costs in the future. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

This study investigated the spatial distributions of larval and juvenile/adult stages of the Antarctic myctophid Electrona antarctica. Fish were sampled in January 2011 and 2012 on a transect along 140 degrees E and in January 2013 along 110 degrees E using two different opening/closing net systems. In total, 1075 specimens of E. antarctica were collected: 948 larvae, 127 juveniles/adults, and 2 in the transformation stage. Most larvae were collected at 5-200 m depth, with diel vertical migration (DVM) not apparent. Larvae were mainly distributed in the Modified Circumpolar Deep Water (-1.5 degrees C-2.0 degrees C). By contrast, an analysis of the echogram at 38 kHz and discrete depth samples implied that juveniles/adults undertook DVM except in the continental slope area (65.5 degrees S). As the distribution of krill is limited to the cold water mass (<-1.5 degrees C) along the continental slope, E. antarctica and krill populations are spatially separated off Wilkes Land during summer. According to the previously estimated larval period of 30-47 days, E. antarctica may spawn in late November to December in the marginal ice zone or near the sea ice edge. This study suggests that the environment related to sea ice provides a nursery ground for early stage larvae of E. antarctica. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. and NIPR.

The effects of the dietary regimes were evaluated in terms of specific growth rate (SGR), feed conversion ratio (FCR), daily feed intake (DFI), and whole body chemical composition (moisture, crude ash, crude protein and crude lipid). At the end the trial the fish had tripled their initial weight. SGR, FCR and DFI were 1.17-1.24 %, 0.95-1.01, and 1.03-1.14% respectively. Although differences were observed between some groups, none of the tested feed additives improved SGR, FCR, and DFI, compared to the control diet. Analysis of whole body proximate composition showed that moisture, crude ash, crude protein, and crude lipid ranged 61.45-64.00%, 3.96-4.26%, 15.44-17.26% and 14.87-18.82% respectively. Crude lipid concentration was higher in whole body of fish fed the nucleoside supplemented diet compared to control, lecithin, and krill groups. No other effects of the dietary regime on the whole body composition of sharpshout sea bream were observed.

Shapes of Krill Swarms and Fish Schools Emerge as Aggregation Members Avoid Predators and Access Oxygen	CURRENT BIOLOGY												Many types of animals exhibit aggregative behavior: birds flock, bees swarm, fish shoal, and ungulates herd [1]. Terrestrial and aerial aggregations can be observed directly, and photographic techniques have provided insights into the behaviors of animals in these environments [2] and data against which behavioral theory can be tested [3]. Underwater, however, limited visibility can hamper direct observation, and understanding of shoaling remains incomplete. We used multibeam sonar to observe three-dimensional structure of Antarctic krill shoals acoustically [4]. Shoal size and packing density varied greatly, but surface area:volume ratios (roughnesses) were distributed narrowly about similar to 3.3 m(-1) [5]. Shoals of clupeid fish (e.g., sardine, anchovy) from geographically and oceanographically diverse locations have very similar roughnesses [6-8]. This common emergent shape property suggests common driving forces across diverse ecosystems. Group behavior can be complex [9], but a simple tradeoff-that we model-in which individual fish and krill juggle only their access to oxygen-replete water and exposure to predation can explain the observed shoal shape. Decreasing oxygen availability in a warming world ocean [10] may impact shoal structure: because structure affects catchability by predators and fishers [11-13], understanding the response will be necessary for ecological and commercial reasons.

Differences of pressure effect among blastomere stages, 1-cell, 2-cell, 4-cell, 8-cell, 16-cell, blastula and limb-bud stage, were examined under two pressurizing conditions, abruptly (10 atm/min) and gradually (0.1 atm/min) increasing. Egg hatching success, deformity frequency and apoptotic cell degradation of hatched nauplii were examined. Egg hatching success rate was not significantly different between blastomere stages, and also between pressurizing conditions. Deformity frequencies of hatched nauplii were low in the early 1-cell and 2-cell stages, and high in the later blastula and limb-bud stages, in both abrupt and gradual pressurizing conditions. On the other hand, in regard to difference in pressurizing conditions, deformity frequency in gradual pressurizing was significantly higher than that in abrupt pressurizing rate. Gradual pressure increase seems to be more harmful to C. sinicus eggs than abrupt pressure change. Apoptosis induced in nauplii by hydrostatic pressure was detected for the first time in marine zooplankton. The embryos of C. sinicus are sensitive to pressure variations, that is, these embryos are supposed to sink to deeper waters, incurring greater risk of having deformities. In the field, C. sinicus ascend to the surface and spawn at night. By looking from this upward behavior, eggs are spawned at lower pressure and warmer temperature. Probably, the harmless low pressure and warm temperature lead eggs to hatch early and to recruit successfully.

Measuring the enzyme activity is an interesting manner to monitor the moult process at sub-individual level, complementary to the classical observation of the integument morphogenesis, ecdysis success, or moult cycle duration. The present study aimed to optimise the methodology of using N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase (NAGase) activity to monitor moulting in the marine prawn Palaemon serratus, and to compare NAGase activity levels along the moult cycle of both male and female specimens. First, to optimise protocols for five different organs, different reaction medium compositions were tested, considering the type buffer, concentration of the substrate, and the load in enzymatic extract. Second, levels of NAGase activity were closely monitored during eight moulting stages in male prawns. Variations in NAGase activity were observed during the moult cycle, with an increase in activity in the late premoult phase of approximately 2.4-fold the level of the intermoult phase. This response profile was observed for each tested organ. The levels of NAGase activity of male and female specimens were compared during three stages of the premoult phase. The patterns observed for both sexes were similar for all the tested organs.																	1095-6433	1531-4332				JUN	2021	256								110932	10.1016/j.cbpa.2021.110932							WOS:000640388900007	33677047

In this study, the effects of subcritical water temperatures (100-180 degrees C) and times (0-10 min) on color changes (L*, a*, and b*) and astaxanthin degradation in Pacific krill were investigated. In addition, an aqueous solution of pure astaxanthin and that of crude astaxanthin from Pacific krill, both at a concentration of 5 mg/L, were subjected to treatment under subcritical water conditions using a flow-type reactor to compare the degradation of free astaxanthin and astaxanthin fatty acid esters. To compare the results of the different treatment conditions on the properties of astaxanthin, the severity factor (log R-0) was calculated, which ranged from 0.38 to 3.52. The extractability of astaxanthin enhanced when the subcritical water treatment was carried out at log R-0 values of 2.00-2.44. In contrast, astaxanthin underwent 50% degradation at log R-0 > 2.44. The changes in the a* values correlated well with the astaxanthin content in the treated krill, while the b* and L* values might relate to the browning components forming owing to Maillard reaction. The results show that free astaxanthin was less stable than crude astaxanthin under subcritical water treatment.

We used shipboard surveys over nine years to investigate environmental determinants of seabird hotspots near the Antarctic Peninsula, a region experiencing rapid climate change and an expanding krill fishery. We hypothesize that seabird hotspots are structured by mesoscale ocean conditions that reflect differences in prey distribution within oceanic and coastal waters. We used generalized additive models to quantify functional relationships of seabird hotspots with krill biomass, and a suite of remotely sensed environmental variables, such as eddy kinetic energy. The spatial organization, changes in intensity, and distribution shifts of seabird hotspots indicate different environmental drivers within coastal and oceanic domains and reflect the seasonal variability of the ecosystem. Our results indicate at least eight mesoscale hotspot zones that represent ecologically important areas where significant krill and predator biomass may be concentrated. Our ecosystem assessment of seabird hotspots identified critical foraging habitat and provided reference points to benefit research on estimating their trophic impacts on Antarctic ecosystems and potential effects from the krill fishery. Our approach is generally applicable to other pelagic ecosystems that are structured by hydrographic fronts and eddies, and containing schooling forage species shared by multiple wide-ranging predators. Furthermore, identification of biological hotspots is useful for the designation of marine protected areas most critical to potentially endangered wildlife and fisheries resources.																	1432-9840	1435-0629				AUG	2017	20	5					885	903		10.1007/s10021-016-0078-8							WOS:000407846100003

This is partly due to certain difficulties in relation to logistics, operations and survey design associated with scientific surveys that have been obstacles for us to better understand krill biology. The krill fishery is the largest fishery in the Southern Ocean, continuously operating since early 1970s. Recent studies revealed its potential to be used as a unique source for scientific discussions to understand krill biology. In this paper, after a brief overview of krill fishery operation and krill biology, we examine how current data collection through the fishery operation could contribute to a greater understanding of krill biology, and then suggest future priorities for fisheries-related research in relation to recent changes in the Southern Ocean environment.

J	Guihen, D				Guihen, Damien			High-resolution acoustic surveys with diving gliders come at a cost of aliasing moving targets	PLOS ONE												Underwater gliders are autonomous robots that follow a slow, see-saw path and may be deployed for months on end. Gliders have a dramatically lower payload capacity than research vessels and are thus limited to more simple instrumentation. They have the advantage, however, of being deployable for long periods of time without the high running costs of a ship. Recent years have seen development of the use of gliders to undertake acoustic surveys of biomass in the pelagic environment, highlighting their potential to fill future survey gaps. Here it is shown, using simulation of sampling, that gliders can resolve acoustic targets at greater resolutions than ships, due to their diving pattern, but that survey accuracy is strongly dependent on the speed of the target.

Effect of prey type on the fine-scale feeding behaviour of migrating east Australian humpback whales	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												For terrestrial migrants, feeding at migratory stopover sites is important, with prey quality linked to future survival and reproductive success. In contrast, the importance of this behaviour to marine species is unknown. The humpback whale Megaptera novaeangliae is a marine migrant that is thought to fast while migrating; however, recent studies suggest that feeding may occur during this time. The aims of this study were to determine how the prey type available on a migratory route off Eden, New South Wales, Australia, influenced whether whales fed or not, and to study the fine-scale behaviour of the whales. Digital acoustic recording tags (DTAGs) and focal follows were used to record whale behaviour. A larger proportion of groups were determined to be feeding when krill was observed at the surface. Whales encountering fish spent a small percentage (28%) of time feeding, behaving similarly to non-feeding whales on migration, with small groups, a higher proportion of males sampled, and relatively straight tracks. In contrast, whales encountering surface swarms of krill spent significantly more time feeding (92%) and behaved similarly to whales on feeding grounds, with larger groups, more females sampled, and tracks with high turning angles. Therefore, changes in the available prey type influenced the amount of time spent feeding and the social dynamics of groups. Given the link between the amount of feeding completed on migration and the future survival and reproductive success of individuals in terrestrial species, the impact of such fluctuations on marine species such as the humpback whale deserves more attention.

Here, we used stable isotopes to investigate and discuss their trophic role and mode of coexistence. Bulk carbon (delta C-13) and nitrogen (delta N-15) stable isotope analyses of Thysanoessa longicaudata, T. inermis, T. raschii and Meganyctiphanes norvegica sampled in June 2010 in Godthabsfjord, SW Greenland, revealed new insight into the species' trophic roles and positions. There was a general positive correlation between body length and trophic position. The largest species, M. norvegica, had the highest trophic position (TP [mean +/- SE] = 2.8 +/- 0.2) indicating carnivory, while T. inermis (TP = 2.4 +/- 0.3) had a more omnivorous diet. In turn, T. longicaudata and T. raschii (TP = 2.2 +/- 0.2) were herbivorous. Along the fjord, plankton composition affected trophic position. T. longicaudata was more omnivorous offshore than inshore, where it had the same trophic position as the baseline primary consumer Calanus spp. Similarly, T. raschii and T. inermis had higher trophic positions in the mouth of the fjord compared with the inner fjord. Regardless of spatial variations in potential food and the overlap in diet, typical of opportunistic species, body size appears as the key factor determining the role and position of krill in the food web.

Climate change and the Antarctic marine ecosystem: an essay on management implications	ANTARCTIC SCIENCE												In this paper we review evidence for, and anticipated consequences of, climate change in Antarctic marine communities, examining the potential impacts on invertebrates and vertebrates alike and exploring plausible outcomes for species, with examples principally from the Antarctic literature. We suggest that industries with the greatest potential to aggravate climate change impacts on marine communities are marine capture fisheries. In the Southern Ocean, harvesting is governed under the Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR). CCAMLR espouses an ecological management framework and so has the capacity to mitigate harvesting impacts such that they do not worsen impacts from climate change. We discuss some of the implications of climate change and advocate that CCAMLR address certain key issues if it is to fulfil its international obligations. It will be essential for CCAMLR to determine relative risks (uncertainties), impacts and timescales, of various processes consequent on climate change. Such risk assessments should be feasible with current knowledge and should provide a focus for future work. We believe it will be important to prioritize issues that reduce impacts and uncertainties by the greatest degree, and propose that future plans should involve shared responsibility (e.g. with SCAR etc.) for each of the risks described.																	0954-1020	1365-2079				AUG	2010	22	4					387	398		10.1017/S0954102010000222							WOS:000280934100007

Using stable isotopes to assess carbon and nitrogen turnover in the Arctic sympagic amphipod Onisimus litoralis	OECOLOGIA												Food web studies based on stable C and N isotope ratios usually assume isotopic equilibrium between a consumer and its diet. In the Arctic, strong seasonality in food availability often leads to diet switching, resulting in a consumer's isotopic composition to be in flux between different food sources. Experimental work investigating the time course and dynamics of isotopic change in Arctic fauna has been lacking, although these data are crucial for accurate interpretation of food web relationships. We investigated seasonal (ice-covered spring vs. ice-free summer) and temperature (1 vs. 4 degrees C) effects on growth and stable C and N isotopic change in the common nearshore Arctic amphipod Onisimus litoralis following a diet switch and while fasting in the laboratory. In spring we found no significant temperature effect on N turnover [half-life (HL) estimates: HL-N = 20.4 at 4 degrees C, 22.4 days at 1 degrees C] and a nonsignificant trend for faster growth and C turnover at the higher temperature (HL-C = 13.9 at 4 degrees C, 18.7 days at 1 degrees C). A strong seasonal effect was found, with significantly slower growth and C and N turnover in the ice-free summer period (HL-N = 115.5 days, HL-C = 77.0 days). Contrary to previous studies, metabolic processes rather than growth accounted for most of the change in C and N isotopic composition (84-89 and 67-77%, respectively). This study provides the first isotopic change and metabolic turnover rates for an Arctic marine invertebrate and demonstrates the risk of generalizing turnover rates based on taxon, physiology, and environment. Our results highlight the importance of experimental work to determine turnover rates for species of interest.

We studied the winter foraging behaviour of Weddell seals in Adelie Land, East Antarctica, and the influence of abiotic parameters (bathymetry, hydrology, sea ice, light intensity) on their foraging behaviour. A total of six seals were fitted with Conductivity Temperature Depth Satellite Relayed Data Loggers (CTD-SRDL) at Dumont D'Urville (similar to 67 degrees S, 140 degrees E) during the austral winters in 2007 and 2008. The tags transmitted positions and dive information over 169 +/- 31 day, providing a total of 20,400 dive profiles and 2350 CTD profiles. Significant environmental influences on seal diving behaviour and habitat use were detected. Seals dived deeper, longer and increased their foraging effort during the day than at night with intermediate values for twilight. During the winter season the maximum dive depth decreased in association with an increase in dive duration, but foraging effort was unchanged. Seals spent more time at the bottom of their dives in shallow waters associated with relatively smooth bathymetry and dominated by Antarctic Surface Water. Considering the whole winter, Weddell seals tended to favour enriched, warmer and less dense water masses following their seasonal appearance on the shelf (Antarctic Surface Water and Modified Circumpolar Deep Water). Our results are consistent with seals feeding primarily on Pleuragramma antarcticum during winter, tracking their vertical diel migrations and foraging in areas associated with bathymetric and hydrographic features likely to concentrate prey patches.

In addition to profiling studies at 50 stations during each of two cruises, pumped surface water was used to continuously record in vivo chlorophyll-a (chl-a) fluorescence and beam attenuation coefficients (c(t)). Measurements on discrete samples included chl-a, phytoplankton organic carbon (A(c)), and total particulate organic carbon (POC). Equations were developed which permitted contour-mapping of chl-a and POC throughout the entire grid based on continuous measurements of in vivo chl-a fluorescence and c(t) values. Phytoplankton abundance increased from January-February (cruise I) to February-March (cruise II) as evidenced by mean surface chl-a values (0.8 and 1.34 mug l-1, respectively) and mean A, values for the upper 20 m of the water column (21.3 and 39.8 mug Cl-1, respectively). Microplankton accounted for 29% (cruise I) and 40% (cruise II) of the total phytoplankton, based on direct measurements of chl-a.

J	LIZOTTE, MP; SULLIVAN, CW				LIZOTTE, MP; SULLIVAN, CW			PHOTOSYNTHETIC CAPACITY IN MICROALGAE ASSOCIATED WITH ANTARCTIC PACK ICE	POLAR BIOLOGY												Previous studies of primary production in Antarctic seas have concluded that microalgae associated with sea ice make only a minor contribution to the carbon budget; however, production estimates for sea ice algae have been based almost exclusively on microalgae from nearshore fast ice. We measured biomass and rates of photosynthesis (at saturating irradiances) in microalgae collected from offshore pack ice during four cruises to the Weddell-Scotia Sea and the region west of the Antarctic Peninsula. Chlorophyll a concentrations in pack ice (0.089 to 260 mug l-1) were as high as reported from fast ice. Photosynthetic rates typically ranged (median 75%) from 0.3 to 3.6 mug C mug chl a-1 h-1 (n = 127; arithmetic mean = 1.7, SD = 1.9). These photosynthetic capacities are approximately an order of magnitude greater than previously reported for fast ice microalgae, but are similar to rates reported for Antarctic phytoplankton. Because pack ice constitutes more than 90% of the ice cover in Antarctic seas and indigenous microalgae have a higher photosynthetic capacity than previously realized, we raise the question: has the importance of sea ice algae to primary production in the southern ocean been underestimated?																	0722-4060					OCT	1992	12	5					497	502									WOS:A1992JT21200003

We sampled between 2010 and 2016 from spring to late summer and incubated individuals. Fresh molts were collected daily and measured to calculate the growth increment following the instantaneous growth rate method while eggs were counted daily. Our results showed a seasonal pattern of somatic growth and reproduction driven by temperature and chl. a concentration with a decrease in somatic growth in August when egg production was maximal, suggesting a trade-off. Functional relationship analyses revealed a narrow optimal temperature window for somatic growth with maximum temperatures observed between 1.2 and 2.0 degrees C in the cold intermediate layer (50-150 m). Maximum egg production was observed at temperatures between 3.8 and 5.7 degrees C in the surface layer (0-50 m). A required minimum concentration of chl. a of 9 mg.m(-3) for somatic growth was observed. For egg production, the minimum observed was integrated chl. a (0-50 m) of 80 mg.m(-2). We also observed the importance of optimal conditions lasting for one to 3 weeks to support biological processes in T. raschii.																	0142-7873	1464-3774				MAY-JUN	2021	43	3					458	474		10.1093/plankt/fbab032							WOS:000661484700010

Lipofuscin concentration in the left olfactory lobe cell mass of the brain was measured using image analysis of fluorescence micrographs. Age predictions based on lipofuscin concentration were more accurate and had narrower 95% confidence limits than those derived from the more conventional body size and weight predictors for all age groups tested (180, 300, 420, 780 d). Overall, use of lipofuscin concentration produced a significantly lower (p < 0.001) mean age-prediction error (16.65%)than use of carapace length or body weight (32.45 and 32.3%, respectively). Carapace length was of little value for prediction of the age of older individuals. Mathematical models defining the relationships between temperature, age and lipofuscin accumulation were derived from laboratory-reared individuals. These models did not describe adequately the course of lipofuscin accumulation in crayfish from the field over the whole lifespan. Field data from three ''known'' year-classes were used to generate simulated size-frequency and lipofuscin concentration-frequency histograms. Year-classes in the lipofuscin concentration frequency-histogram were much more easily distinguished than in the size-frequency histogram. Under field conditions, lipofuscin concentration was a better predictor of chronological age than conventional morphometric measures.																	0025-3162					DEC	1994	121	2					237	245		10.1007/BF00346731							WOS:A1994PZ81100005

Krill biomass and aggregation structure in relation to tidal cycle in a penguin foraging region off the Western Antarctic Peninsula	ICES JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE												Antarctic krill are a key component of the diet of Adlie penguins inhabiting the Western Antarctic Peninsula (WAP), yet our understanding of the variability of krill distribution patterns within nearshore penguin feeding grounds is limited. A recent study of the foraging patterns of penguins breeding in the northern WAP suggests that tidal phase plays a role in foraging distance. We used acoustics to examine biomass and aggregation structure of krill in the penguin foraging grounds off Palmer Station during diurnal and semi-diurnal tides. Nearshore, integrated krill biomass during diurnal tides was significantly higher than during semi-diurnal tides. Krill aggregations were also shallower, closer together, and larger in dimension during diurnal tides. Conversely, krill aggregations had higher volumetric biomass and abundance during semi-diurnal tides. Further offshore, at the head of the Palmer Deep canyon, krill aggregations were similar to those observed nearshore during diurnal tides (i.e. shallow, close together, and large in dimension). Since krill aggregation structure strongly influences availability as a potential prey source, we suggest that foraging behavior of Adlie penguins in this region is strongly linked to the variability in nearshore krill aggregation structure as well as biomass.

J	Santora, JA; Reiss, CS				Santora, Jarrod A.; Reiss, Christian S.			Geospatial variability of krill and top predators within an Antarctic submarine canyon system	MARINE BIOLOGY												The spatial distribution patterns of krill, seabirds (penguin, petrel and albatross), fur seals and baleen whales were mapped in nearshore waters (< 50 km from land) to investigate their habitat selection within two adjacent submarine canyons near Livingston Island, Antarctica. Three shipboard surveys were conducted (February 2005-2007), and an echosounder was used to measure the distribution and abundance of krill while simultaneously conducting visual surveys to map seabird and marine mammals. Using a multispecies approach, we test the hypothesis that spatial organization of krill and top predators co-vary according to fine-scale changes in bathymetry in the nearshore marine environment. GAMs are used to examine the effect of sea depth, slope and distance to isobaths on the spatial distribution and abundance of krill and predators. Spatial distribution patterns of krill and predators relate to fine-scale (1-10 km) changes in bathymetry and exhibit cross-shelf gradients in abundance. Krill were concentrated along the shelf-break and abundant within both submarine canyons. Predators exhibited different preferences for locations within the submarine canyon system that relates to their foraging behavior. Penguins concentrated closer to shore and within the head of the east submarine canyon immediately adjacent to a breeding colony. Whales were also concentrated over the head of the east canyon (overlapping with penguins), whereas albatrosses and fur seals were concentrated in the west canyon. Fur seals also showed preference for steep slopes and were concentrated along the shelf-break. Petrels exhibited peaks in abundance throughout both submarine canyons. Owing to their orientation, size and proximity to the coastline, submarine canyons provide important habitat heterogeneity for krill and a variety of predators. This study highlights the multispecies approach for studying spatial ecology of top predators and krill and has implications for marine spatial management of the Scotia Sea.																	0025-3162					NOV	2011	158	11					2527	2540		10.1007/s00227-011-1753-0							WOS:000296088600013

Sympatry and resource partitioning between the largest krill consumers around the Antarctic Peninsula	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												Understanding how closely related, sympatric species distribute themselves relative to their environment is critical to understanding ecosystem structure and function and predicting effects of environmental variation. The Antarctic Peninsula supports high densities of krill and krill consumers; however, the region is warming rapidly, with unknown consequences. Humpback whales Megaptera novaeangliae and Antarctic minke whales Balaenoptera bonaerensis are the largest krill consumers here, yet key data gaps remain about their distribution, behavior, and interactions and how these will be impacted by changing conditions. Using satellite telemetry and novel spatial point-process modeling techniques, we quantified habitat use of each species relative to dynamic environmental variables and determined overlap in core habitat areas during summer months when sea ice is at a minimum. We found that humpback whales ranged broadly over continental shelf waters, utilizing nearshore bays, while minke whales restricted their movements to sheltered bays and areas where ice is present. This presents a scenario where minke whale core habitat overlaps substantially with the broader home ranges of humpback whales. While there is no indication that prey is limiting in this ecosystem, increased overlap between these species may arise as climate-driven changes that affect the extent, timing, and duration of seasonal sea ice decrease the amount of preferred foraging habitat for minke whales while concurrently increasing it for humpback whales. Our results provide the first quantitative assessment of behaviorally based habitat use and sympatry between these 2 krill consumers and offers insight into the potential effects of a rapidly changing environment on the structure and function of a polar ecosystem.

J	Taskaya, L; Chen, YC; Jaczynski, J				Taskaya, Latif; Chen, Yi-Chen; Jaczynski, Jacek			Color improvement by titanium dioxide and its effect on gelation and texture of proteins recovered from whole fish using isoelectric solubilization/precipitation	LWT-FOOD SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												Whiteness is a critical attribute for restructured fish products such as surimi seafood. However, the whiteness of gels made from proteins recovered from fish processing by-products or whole fish using isoelectric solubilization/precipitation is poor. The by-products and whole fish contain bones, scales, skin, etc. that affect gel color. Therefore, whiteness needs to be improved if marketable products are to be developed from recovered proteins. The objectives of this study were to determine effects of titanium dioxide (TiO2) on: (1) color: (2) texture; and (3) viscoelasticity (G') of gels made from isolated carp proteins and Alaska pollock surimi. Carp proteins were recovered with isoelectric solubilization/precipitation. TiO2 was added to carp proteins at 0-0.5 g/100 g. TiO2 was not added to surimi. Due to much higher (P < 0.05) yellowness (b*) and lower (P < 0.05) lightness (C), the whiteness of carp gels without TiO2 was lower (P < 0.05) than surimi gels. TiO2 at >= 0.2 g/100 g resulted in better (P < 0.05) whiteness of carp gels than surimi gels without chalky and artificially white appearance. TiO2 did not affect texture or viscoelasticity. This research demonstrates that whiteness of restructured fish products based on proteins recovered from whole fish via isoelectric solubilization/precipitation can be similar to the whiteness of surimi seafood.

J	Demer, DA				Demer, DA			An estimate of error for the CCAMLR 2000 survey estimate of krill biomass	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY												Combined sampling and measurement error is estimated for the CCAMLR 2000 acoustic estimate of krill abundance in the Scotia Sea. First, some potential sources of uncertainty in generic echo-integration surveys are reviewed. Then, specific to the CCAMLR 2000 survey, some of the primary sources of measurement error is explored. The error in system calibration is evaluated in relation to the effects of variations in water temperature and salinity on sound speed, sound absorption, and acoustic-beam characteristics. Variation in krill target strength is estimated using a distorted-wave Born approximation model fitted with measured distributions of animal lengths and orientations. The variable effectiveness of two-frequency species classification methods is also investigated using the same scattering model. Most of these components of measurement uncertainty are frequency-dependent and covariant. Ultimately, the total random error in the CCAMLR 2000 acoustic estimate of krill abundance is estimated from a Monte Carlo simulation which assumes independent estimates of krill biomass are derived from acoustic backscatter measurements at three frequencies (38, 120, and 200 kHz). The overall coefficient of variation (10.2less than or equal toCVless than or equal to11.6%; 95% CI) is not significantly different from the sampling variance alone (CV = 11.4%). That is, the measurement variance is negligible relative to the sampling variance due to the large number of measurements averaged to derive the ultimate biomass estimate. Some potential sources of bias (e.g., stemming from uncertainties in the target strength model, the krill length-to-weight model, the species classification method, bubble attenuation, signal thresholding, and survey area definition) may be more appreciable components of measurement uncertainty.

J	Smith, C				Smith, Carl			A warming Southern Ocean may compromise Antarctic blue whale foetus growth	JOURNAL OF VERTEBRATE BIOLOGY												After declining in abundance due to commercial whaling during the 20th century, populations of the Antarctic blue whale (Balaenoptera musculus intermedia) have failed to recover to pre-exploitation levels. Using historical whaling data from 1926-1954, in combination with temperature data for the Southern Ocean, a gamma GLM with temporal dependency was fitted to 20,144 records of B. m. intermedia foetus size using Bayesian inference. There was a negative relationship between antecedent winter sea surface temperature (SST) in the Southern Ocean on foetus size. This relationship is proposed as being mediated by a positive effect of the extent of winter sea ice on Antarctic krill (Euphasia superba) abundance on which B. m. intermedia feed. There was also a positive density-dependent effect of a "krill surplus" at low B. m. intermedia population sizes. However, the positive effect of a "krill surplus" at low B. m. intermedia population size on foetus growth was reversed at elevated winter SST due to a proposed negative impact on E. superba recruitment. Projected increases in temperature in the Southern Ocean are predicted to compromise the growth rates of B. m. intermedia foetuses, with implications for the capacity of the subspecies to recover from overexploitation.																	2694-7684					MAR	2021	70	2							20114	10.25225/jvb.20114							WOS:000640645200001						
J	Salomon, M; Saborowski, R				Salomon, M; Saborowski, R			Tissue-specific distribution of pyruvate kinase isoforms improve the physiological plasticity of Northern krill, Meganyctiphanes norvegica	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY												The Northern krill, Meganyctiphanes norvegica (Crustacea, Euphausiacea) is widely distributed in the northern and northeastern parts of the Atlantic Ocean where it faces rapid variations in water temperatures and food. We studied the physiological potential of krill to compensate for environmentally induced metabolic changes. Two isoforms of the glycolytic key enzyme pyruvate kinase (PKI and PKII, EC 2.7.1.40) were partly purified from M norvegica by anion exchange chromatography. Specific activities and catalytic properties of each isoform were determined in whole body extracts as well as in selected organs and tissues of males and females. Both PK-isoenzymes differed slightly in their temperature profiles, their activation energy and their molecular weights. PKI showed a high affinity for the substrate PEP and was not affected by fructose-1.6-bisphosphate (FBP). In contrast, PKII showed low affinity for PEP but was strongly activated by FBP, up to 40-fold. The specific PK-activity of whole organisms was lower in females (44.9 +/- 4.8 U center dot g(ww)(-1)) than in males (61.3 +/- 7.7 U center dot g(ww)(-1)). In females PK II represented 20% of the total PK-activity while it was only 10% in males. Highest PK activities were present in the hearts, the eyes, pleopods and in the thoracopods. In the stomachs and the midgut glands PK activities were low. Almost all organs contained PKI and PKII However, PKI prevailed in the abdomens, the pleopods, the thoracopods, and in the thoracic muscles. PKII dominated in the eyes, the midgut glands and in the ovaries. Experiments showed that the tissue concentrations of FBP increased with food uptake and temperature. The expression of two PK-isoforms with different kinetic properties and the mediation of substrate affinity by FPB is a powerful tool to immediately regulate glycolytic energy flows in different organs. The krill is capable of adjusting energy consumption to changes in nutritional conditions as well as variations of environmental temperatures. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Here we use the Framework on Ocean Observing (FOO) to begin developing ecosystem Essential Ocean Variables (eEOVs) for the Southern Ocean Observing System (SOOS). An eEOV is a defined biological or ecological quantity, which is derived from field observations,, and which contributes significantly to assessments of Southern Ocean ecosystems. Here, assessments are concerned with estimating status and trends in ecosystem properties, attribution of trends to causes, and predicting future trajectories. eEOVs should be feasible to collect at appropriate spatial and temporal scales and are useful to the extent that they contribute to direct estimation of trends and/or attribution, and/or development of ecological (statistical or simulation) models to support assessments. In this paper we outline the rationale, including establishing a set of criteria, for selecting eEOVs for the SOOS and develop a list of candidate eEOVs for further evaluation. Other than habitat variables, nine types of eEOVs for Southern Ocean taxa are identified within three classes: state (magnitude, genetic/species, size spectrum), predator-prey (diet, foraging range), and autecology (phenology, reproductive rate, individual growth rate, detritus). Most candidates for the suite of Southern Ocean taxa relate to state or diet. Candidate autecological eEOVs have not been developed other than for marine mammals and birds. We consider some of the spatial and temporal issues that will influence the adoption and use of eEOVs in an observing system in the Southern Ocean, noting that existing operations and platforms potentially provide coverage of the four main sectors of the region the East and West Pacific, Atlantic and Indian. Lastly, we discuss the importance of simulation modelling in helping with the design of the observing system in the long term. Regional boundary: south of 30 degrees S. (C) 2016 The Authors.

Capturing foraging and resting behavior using nested multivariate Markov models in an air-breathing marine vertebrate	MOVEMENT ECOLOGY												Background: Matching animal movement with the behaviors that shape life history requires a rigorous connection between the observed patterns of space use and inferred behavioral states. As animal-borne dataloggers capture a greater diversity and frequency of three dimensional movements, we can increase the complexity of movement models describing animal behavior. One challenge in combining data streams is the different spatial and temporal frequency of observations. Nested movement models provide a flexible framework for gleaning data from long-duration, but temporally sparse, data sources. Results: Using a two-layer nested model, we combined geographic and vertical movement to infer traveling, foraging and resting behaviors of Humpback whales off the West Antarctic Peninsula. This approach refined previous work using only geographic data to delineate coarser behavioral states. Our results showed increased intensity in foraging activity in late season animals as the whales prepared to migrate north to tropical calving grounds. Our model also suggests strong diel variation in movement states, likely linked to daily changes in prey distribution. Conclusions: Using a combination of two-dimensional and three-dimensional movement data, we highlight the connection between whale movement and krill availability, as well as the complex spatial pattern of whale foraging in productive polar waters.

J	Becker, KN; Warren, JD				Becker, Kaylyn N.; Warren, Joseph D.			Material properties of Northeast Pacific zooplankton	ICES JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE												We measured the density and sound speed contrasts relative to seawater of Northeast Pacific zooplankton. The density contrast (g) was measured for euphausiids, decapods (Sergestes similis), amphipods (Primno macropa, Phronima sp., and Hyperiid spp.), siphonophore bracts, chaetognaths, larval fish, crab megalopae, larval squid, and medusae. Morphometric data (length, width, and height) were collected for these taxa. Density contrasts varied within and between zooplankton taxa. The mean and standard deviation (s.d.) for euphausiid density contrast were 1.059 +/- 0.009. Relationships between zooplankton density contrast and morphometric measurements, geographic location, and environmental conditions were investigated. Site had a significant effect on euphausiid density contrast. Density contrasts of euphausiids collected in the same geographic area similar to 4-10 d apartwere significantly higher (p < 0.001). Sound speed contrast (h) was measured for euphausiids and pelagic decapods (S. similis) and it varied between taxa. The mean and s.d. for euphausiid sound speed were 1.019 +/- 0.009. Euphausiid mass was calculated from measured density and volume, and a relationship between euphausiid mass and length was produced. We determined that euphausiid volume could be accurately estimated from two-dimensional measurements of animal body shape, and that biomass (or biovolume) could be accurately calculated from digital photographs of animals. Data from this study can improve the accuracy of theoretical acoustic scattering models for these taxa, resulting in more accurate estimates of zooplankton biomass in this region.

Spatial assessment of fin whale hotspots and their association with krill within an important Antarctic feeding and fishing ground	MARINE BIOLOGY												Fin whale (Balaenoptera physalus quoyi) habitat use and its relationship to environmental conditions are generally unknown in the Southern Ocean, presenting challenges for predicting their seasonal occurrence and potential effects of fishing pressure and climate change on this endangered species. Using biological data collected during 14 shipboard surveys off the northern Antarctic Peninsula and oceanographic data from satellite remote sensing, we mapped the distribution of fin whale hotspots, Antarctic krill abundance (biomass from acoustics, concentrations from nets) and ocean conditions during mid- and late-summer to investigate the environmental determinants of whale hotspots. Generalized additive models (GAM) were used to test the hypothesis that intra-seasonal changes in fin whale hotspot distribution relate to sea surface temperature (SST), krill abundance and eddy kinetic energy (EKE). More whale hotspots (sightings and individuals) are observed during late- than mid-summer surveys. During mid-summer, hotspots occurred near Elephant Island while in late-summer they were distributed throughout the slope region in proximity to the mean location of the southern Antarctic Circumpolar Current Front. The spatial mean of EKE did not differ between mid- and late-summer surveys, but the spatial mean of SST was significantly warmer during late-summer. The GAM for mid-summer indicates that fin whale hotspots were positively related to SST, EKE and acoustically determined krill biomass. The GAM for late-summer indicates the hotspots were negatively related to net-based krill abundance and positively related to acoustic krill biomass and EKE. This study is important because environmental determinants of fin whale hotspots may be used as reference points for implementing future conservation plans for their recovering populations.																	0025-3162	1432-1793				OCT	2014	161	10					2293	2305		10.1007/s00227-014-2506-7							WOS:000342415200009

J	Chu, DZ; Wiebe, P; Copley, N				Chu, DZ; Wiebe, P; Copley, N			Inference of material properties of zooplankton from acoustic and resistivity measurements	ICES JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE												A laboratory apparatus has been developed and used to infer the sound speed and density contrasts of live zooplankton. The sound speed contrast is determined from acoustic measurements of travel time (time-of-flight) and from the resistivity measurements of volume fraction. The density can then be inferred by applying the phase-compensated distorted wave born approximation (DWBA) model based on the attenuation measurement. For the decapod shrimp (Palaemonetes vulgaris), the inferred sound speed contrast found by using three different methods, namely the two-phase ray model (time average), the compressibility model (Wood's equation), and the DWBA model (scattering theory), is quite consistent, while the inferred density contrast agrees with the measured density reasonably well. The influence of ambient pressure on the sound speed and density contrasts has also been measured using a pressure vessel. The results indicate that the density contrast remains essentially unchanged under different pressure, but the sound speed contrast increases about 2.0% with pressure changing from 0 dbar to about 350 dbar. Although this 2.0% change in sound speed contrast only causes a moderate change in estimating biomass for a decapod shrimp, it could cause a much larger bias for weaker scatterers with the same amount of change in sound speed contrast (up to 20 dB).

Phytoplankton abundance was low (10(3) cells l(-1)) and, over time, the prevailing cell size decreased due to a shift in phytoplankton dominant species from diatoms to dinoflagellates. In situ and remote sensing data showed that oscillations in sea surface temperature, precipitation, ice formation/melting, irradiance (cloud cover) and bottom circulation (indexed by the Antarctic Oscillation Index; AAO) were shown to govern the structure of the phytoplankton. Under negative AAO, diatoms prevailed, with the dominance of large (> 80 mu m) benthic diatoms (e.g. Corethron pennatum and Navicula directa) in periods of low production (10(2) cells l(-1) in 2002-03), and medium-sized (31-80 mu m) centrics (e.g. Thalassiosira spp. and Stellarima microtrias) when the abundance was higher (10(4) cells l(-1) in 2003-04). Conversely, positive AAO led to the co-dominance of dinoflagellates and planktonic diatoms (e.g. Pseudo-nitzschia spp.) in the summers of 2007-08 and 2008-09. These results suggest that the AAO can be a good predictor of phytoplankton in coastal areas around the western Antarctic Peninsula, and may help our understanding of changes in other trophic levels of the food web.

Continuous moulting by Antarctic krill drives major pulses of carbon export in the north Scotia Sea, Southern Ocean	NATURE COMMUNICATIONS												Antarctic krill play an important role in biogeochemical cycles and can potentially generate high-particulate organic carbon (POC) fluxes to the deep ocean. They also have an unusual trait of moulting continuously throughout their life-cycle. We determine the krill seasonal contribution to POC flux in terms of faecal pellets (FP), exuviae and carcasses from sediment trap samples collected in the Southern Ocean. We found that krill moulting generated an exuviae flux of similar order to that of FP, together accounting for 87% of an annual POC flux (22.8gm(-2) y(-1)). Using an inverse modelling approach, we determined the krill population size necessary to generate this flux peaked at 261gm(-2). This study shows the important role of krill exuviae as a vector for POC flux. Since krill moulting cycle depends on temperature, our results highlight the sensitivity of POC flux to rapid regional environmental change.

Open-ocean barriers to dispersal: a test case with the Antarctic Polar Front and the ribbon worm Parborlasia corrugatus (Nemertea: Lineidae)	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY												Open-ocean environments provide few obvious barriers to the dispersal of marine organisms. Major currents and/or environmental gradients potentially impede gene flow. One system hypothesized to form an open-ocean dispersal barrier is the Antarctic Polar Front, an area characterized by marked temperature change, deep water, and the high-flow Antarctic Circumpolar current. Despite these potential isolating factors, several invertebrate species occur in both regions, including the broadcast-spawning nemertean worm Parborlasia corrugatus. To empirically test for the presence of an open-ocean dispersal barrier, we sampled P. corrugatus and other nemerteans from southern South America, Antarctica, and the sub-Antarctic islands. Diversity was assessed by analyzing mitochondrial 16S rRNA and cytochrome c oxidase subunit I sequence data with Bayesian inference and tcs haplotype network analysis. Appropriate neutrality tests were also employed. Although our results indicate a single well-mixed lineage in Antarctica and the sub-Antarctic, no evidence for recent gene flow was detected between this population and South American P. corrugatus. Thus, even though P. corrugatus can disperse over large geographical distances, physical oceanographic barriers (i.e. Antarctic Polar Front and Antarctic Circumpolar Current) between continents have likely restricted dispersal over evolutionary time. Genetic distances and haplotype network analysis between South American and Antarctic/sub-Antarctic P. corrugatus suggest that these two populations are possibly two cryptic species.

J	Werner, I				Werner, I			Faecal pellet production by Arctic under-ice amphipods - transfer of organic matter through the ice/water interface	HYDROBIOLOGIA					33rd European Marine Biology Symposium	SEP 07-11, 1998	WILHELMSHAVEN, GERMANY	Fed Minist Educ & Res, Merck, Oldenburg Landesbank, Nordwest Oelleit GmbH				The underside of Arctic sea ice is inhabited by several autochthonous amphipod species (Apherusa glacialis, Onisimus spp., Gammarus wilkitzkii). The amphipods graze on ice-bound organic matter, such as ice algae, detritus and ice fauna, and release faecal pellets into the underlying water column, thus forming a direct link between the sea ice and the pelagic ecosystems. Experiments on faecal pellet production rates showed species-specific differences, which were related to size of the animals. The smallest species, A. glacialis, produced the highest mean number of pellets (15.4 pellets ind.(-1) d(-1)), followed by Onisimus spp. (2.7 pellets ind.(-1) d(-1)) and the largest species, G. wilkitzkii (1.1 pellets ind.(-1) d(-1)). Relative carbon content of the pellets was very similar in all species (21.2-22.6% dry mass). Juvenile amphipods (Onisimus spp., G. wilkitzkii) produced more pellets with less POC than adults. Based on field determinations of the POC concentration in the lowermost 2 cm of the sea ice (mean: 36.4 mg C m(-2)) and mean amphipod abundances (A. glacialis: 33.8 ind. m(-2), Onisimus spp.: 0.5 ind. m(-2), G, wilkitzkii: 9.4 ind. m(-2)) in the Greenland Sea in summer 1994, the amount of POC transferred from the ice to the water by faecal pellet production was estimated (0.7 mg C m(-2) d(-1) or almost 2% of ice-bound carbon). Since this process probably takes place in all ice-covered Arctic regions as well as during all seasons, grazing and pellet production by under-ice amphipods contributes significantly to matter flux across the ice/water interface.																	0018-8158	1573-5117				MAY 15	2000	426	1-3					89	96		10.1023/A:1003984327103							WOS:000088580000009

Astaxanthin and Its Esters in Pigmented Oil from Fermented Shrimp By-Products	JOURNAL OF AQUATIC FOOD PRODUCT TECHNOLOGY												This study focuses on the isolation and quantification of astaxanthin and its esters in the oils extracted from shrimp waste. The content of astaxanthin was determined by high performance liquid chromatography and ranged from 1.5 to 2.1 mg g(-1). The astaxanthin and its esters were isolated by thin layer chromatography in three fractions: free astaxanthin, monoester, and diester of astaxanthin, with percentages of 44, 32, and 26%, respectively. Oleic acid was the major fatty acid in the monoester fraction, while palmitic, oleic, and stearic acids were present predominantly in the diester fraction. Free radical-scavenging activity of the oils and the three fractions was evaluated. All oils showed an effect on the decrease in the absorbtion of 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl solutions, while among the fractions no significant difference occurred. Pigmented oil from shrimp waste is an organic source of pigment and antioxidant astaxanthin, the esters, and fatty acids, such as eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic.

Data were collected off the coast of Otago, New Zealand for 21 days during 1994 to 1996 using a 130 kHz Klein 595 digital side-scan sonar. A total of 2198 schools were detected. Of these, 348 schools of barracouta (Thyrsites atun), 67 schools of jack mackerel (Trachurus murphyi), and 17 schools of slender tuna (Allothunnus fallai) were identified. Barracouta schools were significantly smaller than schools of jack mackerel or slender tuna, but the size of schools was not related to state of tide, location, water depth, salinity, temperature, or density of krill. Fish schools were detected throughout daylight hours, but dispersed at night. Analysis of stomach contents revealed barracouta, jack mackerel and slender tuna were feeding on krill, Nyctiphanes australis, and fish schools occurred in areas with high densities of N. australis. Variability in the abundance of N. australis was related to salinity; catches were highest in a band of low-salinity water which was present in the study area following periods of high river runoff.

The biogeochemical cycle of mercury in the remote Antarctic region is still poorly understood, with Polar climate change contributing added complexity. Longitudinal biomonitoring of mercury accumulation in Antarctic marine megafauna can contribute top-down insight into the bio-physical drivers of wildlife exposure. The bioaccumulative nature of organic mercury renders high trophic predators at the greatest risk of elevated exposure. Humpback whales represent secondary consumers of the Antarctic sea-ice ecosystem and an ideal biomonitoring species for persistent and bioaccumulative compounds due to their extended life-spans. This study provides the first results of mercury accumulation in humpback whales, and places findings within the context of mercury accumulation in both prey, as well as six other species of Antarctic marine megafauna. Combined, these findings contribute new baseline information regarding mercury exposure to Antarctic wildlife, and highlights methodological prerequisites for routine mercury biomonitoring in wildlife via non-lethally biopsied superficial tissues.

Food web structure and biogeochemical processes during oceanic phytoplankton blooms: An inverse model analysis	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY												The relationship between food web structure and function across two ocean biomes was investigated using an inverse method to recover solutions of food web carbon flows. We estimated the carbon exchanges between major assemblages within plankton food webs in the North Atlantic, using the JGOFS NABE data set (1989) and near the Western Antarctic Peninsula (WAP), using the Palmer Station LTER data set, two areas exhibiting strong seasonal phytoplankton blooms. The recovery of all the potential flows of carbon allowed a system-level analysis, providing insight to processes that are seldom measured in the field and a means of comparing food webs from different regions. In the NABE food web, the dominant carbon flows involved the microorganisms including bacterial carbon demand and grazing by microzooplankton and protozoans. In the WAP food web, krill had the most significant carbon flows including grazing of large phytoplankton and respiration. A comparison between the NABE and the WAP carbon-based food webs showed key differences. Recycling and the activity of the microbial food web were much greater in the NABE food web than in the WAP. However in the WAP inverse solution, the microbial food web was just as important as the classical food web (diatoms to krill to penguins) that is traditionally believed to dominate carbon flows. Carbon flows through the NABE and WAP regions were more highly dependent on recycling than would be anticipated from the size structure of the primary producers, when analyzed using a classification scheme of Legendre, L., Rassoulzadegan, F [1996.

The estimated mean L-T of age-classes 1+, 2+ 3+ and 4+ years during January were, respectively, 14.7, 23.5,29.8 and 35.1 cm at South Georgia. Age-classes 1+, 2+ and 3+ years were 18.3, 26.2 and 33.8 cm at Shag Rocks. The derived Bertalanffy growth parameters for South Georgia were: L-infinity = 51.7 cm, k = 0.27 and to = -0.26. The mean L-T of each age-class of C. gunnari at Shag Rocks was significantly larger than at South Georgia, equivalent to c. 5 months growth, although the annual growth in L-T was similar. This is further evidence that C. gunnari hatched earlier at Shag Rocks. At South Georgia, the mean L-T of age-classes 1+ and 3+ years were correlated, and significantly decreased between 1987 and 2002, and were smaller following warmer summers. This decrease in the size of C. gunnari may be the result of reduced food availability linked to climate warming.

In the Antarctic, the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR) is responsible for this task, and currently Germany leads a corresponding scientific evaluation of the wider Weddell Sea region. Compared to other marine regions within the Southern Ocean, the Weddell Sea is exceptionally well investigated. A tremendous amount of data and information has been produced over the last 4 decades. Here, we give a systematic overview of all data sources collected in the context of the Weddell Sea MPA planning process. The compilation of data sources is comprised of data produced by scientists and institutions from more than 20 countries that were either available within our institutes, downloaded via data portals or transcribed from the literature. It is the first compilation for this area that includes abiotic data, such as bathymetry and sea ice, and ecological data from zooplankton, zoobenthos, fish, birds and marine mammals.

Stable isotope analyses of ancient and modern Adelie Penguin (Pygoscelis adeliae) mummies from the Ross Sea Region, Antarctica	POLAR BIOLOGY												We performed stable carbon (C-13) and nitrogen (N-15) isotope analyses of 12 ancient Adelie penguin (Pygoscelis adeliae) chick mummies recovered from abandoned colonies in the Ross Sea region, Antarctica, to investigate isotopic variation and fractionation over time. We also examined latitudinal variation in penguin diet to address if the modern dietary pattern (an increase in krill as dominant prey to the north) in this region has existed in the past or if this is a recent phenomenon. The ancient mummies range in age from>48,000 C-14 years before present (BP) to500 calendar years BP. Feather, skin, bone, and toenail samples were analyzed from each individual where available. Identical analyses were performed on five modern mummified Adelie penguin chick carcasses and breast feathers of ten recently dead chicks from each of two active colonies, Cape Hallett and Adelie Cove. We found significantly lower N-15 values in Cape Hallett modern chicks as compared to those from Adelie Cove, indicating an entire trophic-level difference in modern diet that agrees with other studies in this region. The ancient mummies exhibited consistent isotopic fractionation of C-13 among the four different tissues through time. Variation in N-15 and C-13 values was greater in bone and skin than in feather or toenail, but N-15 in all four tissues indicated similar dietary trends with latitude as occurs in this region today. These results provide insight into the dietary variability of Adelie penguins across the Ross Sea region and a framework for similar analyses with other avian species.

Zooplankton occur throughout the water column. and are exposed to a range of hydrostatic pressures throughout their lifetime. The hydrostatic pressure apparatus developed in this study makes it possible to (i) increase pressure gradually from 1 to 200 atm, (ii) prevent corrosion of the pressure chamber by introducing a specimen holder that separates the pressure chamber from the surrounding seawater, and (iii) observe a wide size range of zooplankton. including eggs (100-10 000 mu m size range). The new apparatus is useful for the study of mesozooplankton throughout their life history from egg to adult. The effects of hydrostatic pressure on the eggs of the calanoid copepod, Calanus sinicus, were examined using the new hydrostatic pressure apparatus. Hydrostatic pressure did not affect C. sinicus egg development time, but egg-hatching success decreased significantly, with increasing pressure. Most of the nauplii that hatched under high-pressure conditions (101, 501, and 100 atm) were deformed. Eggs of C. sinicus did tolerate pressures of 10 atm. This implies that eggs would not survive if they did not hatch within the upper 100 m.

Metabolic response of Antarctic pteropods (Mollusca: Gastropoda) to food deprivation and regional productivity	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												Pteropods are an abundant group of pelagic gastropods that, although temporally and spatially patchy in the Southern Ocean, can play an important role in food webs and biochemical cycles. We found that the metabolic rate in Limacina helicina antarctica is depressed (similar to 23 %) at lower mean chlorophyll a (chl a) concentrations in the Ross Sea. To assess the specific impact of food deprivation on these animals, we quantified aerobic respiration and ammonia (NH3) production for 2 dominant Antarctic pteropods, L. helicina antarctica and Clone limacina antarctica. Pteropods collected from sites west of Ross Island, Antarctica were held in captivity for a period of 1 to 13 d to determine their metabolic response to laboratory-induced food deprivation. L. helicina antarctica reduced oxygen consumption by similar to 20% after 4 d in captivity. Ammonia excretion was not significantly affected, suggesting a greater reliance on protein as a substrate for cellular respiration during starvation. The oxygen consumption rate of the gymnosome, C. limacina antarctica, was reduced by similar to 35% and NH3 excretion by similar to 55% after 4 d without prey. Our results indicate that there is a link between the large scale chl a concentrations of the Ross Sea and the baseline metabolic rate of pteropods which impacts these animals across multiple seasons.

The absence of a practical means for users to perform ADCP calibration, however, makes the quantitative value of this approach questionable. In an attempt to evaluate ADCP-derived volume backscattering strength (S-c) data, and hence to assess the utility of such measurements for biomass estimation, a regularly calibrated Simrad EK500 scientific echo-sounder (operating at 38, 120 and 200 kHz) and an RDI narrowband ADCP (153.6 kHz) were similarly configured and run in synchrony on a transect in the Southern Ocean. Data were collected by both instruments from congruent depth (4 m) and time (2 min) bins in order to allow direct comparison of numerous discrete values without the need for further signal averaging. Echoes were recorded from the Antarctic krill, Euphausia super ba, in deep-ocean and on-shelf locations during day and night. ADCP-derived volume back scattering strength data from shallow, evenly distributed krill targets were well correlated with equivalent data from the EK500 (r(2) > 0.98), and the offsets between instruments conformed to those predicted for their respective operating frequencies by a theoretical model of sound scattering by krill (H-0: S-upsilon 153.6 kHz = S-upsilon 120 kHz + 2.3 dB, t(0.05(2),155) = 1.98, t = 0.74, P = 0.46). Data from deeper, more irregularly distributed targets differed significantly (P < 0.001). We conclude that under some ideal, but probably rare, circumstances data from the ADCP can be used to derive biomass estimates. The numerous uncertainties surrounding ADCP calibration and the current practical impossibility for users to monitor system performance should, however, preclude these instruments from being used as a matter of course to determine abundance estimates, a task that we believe should remain firmly within the domain of a well calibrated scientific echo sounder.

Individual-based modeling explains the contrasted seasonality in size, growth, and reproduction of the sympatric Arctic (Thysanoessa raschii) and Nordic krill (Meganyctiphanes norvegica) in the St. Lawrence Estuary, eastern Canada	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												The Nordic krill Meganyctiphanes norvegica and Arctic krill Thysanoessa raschii both dominate the krill community within the Estuary and Gulf of St. Lawrence system where they are central forage species for its pelagic ecosystem. We developed a species-specific physiological individual based model that implements the critical physiological processes of growth, molting, and reproduction of female adults as responses to environmental forcing. Key innovations of our approach were the decoupling between the molting schedule and growth, as well as considering two distinct sources of prey (phytoplankton and mesozooplankton). Our simulation results revealed that the details of the feeding process were critical for an accurate representation of the production dynamics of adult individuals from both species. Their specific feeding preferences on phytoplankton and mesozooplankton resulted in distinct species-specific phenological patterns that reproduced observations. The present study highlights the importance of detailed knowledge of diet and feeding behavior of krill species to improve our understanding of population responses in a rapidly changing environment.

Factors affecting time spent at the surface or at depth in a prey patch are likely to alter foraging effort, net energy gain, and fitness. We specifically examined the energetic consequences of a demonstrated reduction in dive duration caused by vessel proximity, and of krill density reductions potentially resulting from krill exploitation or climate change. We estimated net energy gain over a simulated 10h foraging bout under baseline conditions, and three scenarios, reflecting krill density reductions, vessel interactions of different amplitudes, and their combined effects. Generally, the magnitude of the effects increased with that of krill density reductions and duration of vessel proximity. They were also smaller when peak densities were more accessible, i.e., nearer to the surface. Effect size from a reduction in krill density on net energy gain were deemed small to moderate at 5% krill reduction, moderate to large at 10% reduction, and large at 25 and 50% reductions. Vessels reduced cumulated net energy gain by as much as 25% when in proximity for 3 of a 10-h daylight foraging period, and by up to 47-85% when continuously present for 10 h. The impacts of vessel proximity on net energy gain increased with their duration. They were more important when whales were precluded from reaching the most beneficial peak densities, and when these densities were located at deeper depths. When krill densities were decreased by 5% or more, disturbing foraging blue whales for 3 h could reduce their net energy gain by >30%. For this endangered western North Atlantic blue whale population, a decrease in net energy gain through an altered krill preyscape or repeated vessel interactions is of particular concern, as this species relies on a relatively short feeding season to accumulate energy reserves and to fuel reproduction. This study highlights the importance of distance limits during whale-watching operations to ensure efficient feeding, as well as the vulnerability of this specialist to fluctuations in krill densities.

Chinstrap penguins alter foraging and diving behavior in response to the size of their principle prey, Antarctic krill	MARINE BIOLOGY												Penguins may exhibit plasticity in their diving and foraging behaviors in response to changes in prey availability. Chinstrap penguins are dependent predators of Antarctic krill in the Scotia Sea region, but krill populations have fluctuated in recent years. We examined the diet of chinstrap penguins at Livingston Island, South Shetland Islands, in relation to their diving and foraging behavior using time-depth recorders over six breeding seasons: 2002-2007. When krill were smaller, more chinstrap penguins consumed fish. In these years, chinstrap penguins often exhibited a shift to deep dives after sundown, and then resumed a shallower pattern at sunrise. These night dives were unexpectedly deep (up to 110 m) and mean night dive depths sometimes exceeded those from the daytime. The average size of krill in each year was negatively correlated to mean night dive depths and the proportion of foraging trips taken overnight. Based on these patterns, we suggest that when krill were small, penguins increasingly targeted myctophid fish. The average krill size was negatively correlated to the time chinstrap penguins spent foraging which suggests that foraging on smaller krill and fish incurred a cost: more time was spent at sea foraging.																	0025-3162	1432-1793				APR	2008	154	2					201	208		10.1007/s00227-008-0909-z							WOS:000254751400001

With this purpose, three distinct measurements of lipofuscin levels (% area fraction, granule density and mean granule size) were recorded in ten sections of the olfactory lobe cell mass (OLCM) per animal. The image analysis was based on the autofluorescence Emitted by the pigment, which accentuates the contrast between the lipofuscin granules and the background tissue. The concentration of lipofuscin increased significantly with age and was independent of sex. The relationship between age and lipofuscin concentration (area fraction and granule density) was best described by a seasonalized von Bertalanffy function, since the accumulation rate of the pigment dramatically slowed down in fall-winter, probably as a result of reduced seasonal metabolism. The present results confirm the potential of the lipofuscin method in the estimation of physiological age in penaeids and suggest that the application of this methodology can be useful in studies of age structure in wild populations and in the assessment of natural resources.

All major classes of hydrocarbons have been found in the Antarctic ecosystem. At present, anthropogenic input is very low and difficult to resolve from background levels. Pollution in the Antarctic is limited to only a few sources and although contamination can be locally chronic it is very restricted in extent. To date there have been few studies of hydrocarbon pollution and those available have been patchy in spatial coverage and generally lack time-series data. The low levels of natural hydrocarbons and restricted human activity make the Antarctic ecosystem suitable as an indicator of global hydrocarbon pollution.																	0025-326X	1879-3363					1992	25	9-12					266	273		10.1016/0025-326X(92)90681-U							WOS:A1992KX53100011

In this study, calcium binding peptides (CBP) were prepared from Pacific cod bone by trypsin and neutral protease. Ultraviolet spectra, circular dichroism (CD), and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) revealed that carboxyl and amino groups in CBP could bind to Ca2+, and form the peptide-calcium complex (CBP-Ca). Single-pass intestinal perfusion (SPIP) experiments indicated that the intestinal calcium absorption was significantly enhanced (p < 0.01) in CBP-Ca treated Wistar rats. The anti-osteoporosis activity of CBP-Ca was investigated in the ovariectomized (OVX) Wistar rat model. The administration of CBP-Ca significantly (p < 0.01) improved the calcium bioavailability, trabecular bone structure, bone biomechanical properties, bone mineral density, and bone mineralization degree. CBP-Ca notably (p < 0.01) increased serum calcium, however, it remarkably (p < 0.01) reduced the levels of osteocalcin (OCN), bone alkaline phosphatase (BALP), tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase isoform 5b (TRAP5b), and C-telopeptide of type I collagen (CTX-1) in serum. Results suggested that the cod bone derived CBP could bind with calcium, improve the intestinal calcium absorption, calcium bioavailability, and serum calcium, then reduce the bone turnover rate, and thus ameliorate osteoporosis.

High-resolution modelling of the shelf and open ocean adjacent to South Georgia, Southern Ocean	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY												The marine ecosystem on the shelf and open ocean adjacent to South Georgia is extraordinarily rich, with a history of commercial exploitation. Although much progress has been made, attempts at modelling (and hence better understanding) this system have consistently been hampered by the poor representation of key physical processes in global or regional ocean general circulation models. Here we present the development of a high-resolution 3D hydrodynamic model of the South Georgia shelf and the adjacent open ocean, including a novel method for prescribing freshwater fluxes. The ability of the model to reproduce the observed oceanography of the region is quantified by comparisons with data from tide gauges at South Georgia, with satellite-derived sea surface temperatures, and with an extensive CTD dataset collected during January-April 1995. Predicted cotidal charts for the diurnal tides O-1 and K-1 show a periodic amplification in both the current and elevation fields at the shelf edge, suggesting the presence of a diurnally forced continental shelf wave. This could have important implications for processes such as larval transport and retention. The comparison with CTD data reveals mean and root mean square errors in temperature (salinity) of -0.27 degrees C (-0.07) and 0.64 degrees C (0.23), respectively. Vertical profiles of potential temperature and salinity on the shelf agree acceptably well with observations, but there is a tendency for the model to under-predict the density contrast between surface and bottom waters. The main limitation on model accuracy is found to be the large-scale forcing. Releasing a passive tracer into the model, transport and retention pathways are identified, including a prevalence for tracer export from the shelf to the west of South Georgia, and a transport pathway linking South Georgia and Shag Rocks. Significantly, the model suggests this to be a unidirectional link, from South Georgia to Shag Rocks, with possible significance for fisheries management. The implications of these results in the context of the South Georgia ecosystem are discussed briefly, demonstrating the usefulness of this new tool for interdisciplinary studies of the region.

Krill oil extract inhibits the migration of human colorectal cancer cells and down-regulates EGFR signalling and PD-L1 expression	BMC COMPLEMENTARY MEDICINE AND THERAPIES												Background The currently available treatments for colorectal cancer (CRC) are often associated with serious side-effects. Therefore, the development of a novel nutraceutical agent may provide an alternative complementary therapy for CRC. Overexpression of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) associates with a range of cancers while downregulation of EGFR signalling can inhibit cancer growth. Our previous studies have shown that the free fatty acid extract (FFAE) of krill oil exhibits anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic properties. This study determines the effects of krill oil extract on the migration of human CRC cells, and its potential role in modulating EGFR signalling pathway and the expression of programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1). Methods Human CRC cells, DLD-1 and HT-29 were treated with FFAE of KO at 0.03 and 0.12 mu L/100 mu L for 8 or 24 h. Cell migration was determined by Boyden chamber migration assay. The expression of EGFR, phosphorylated EGFR (pEGFR), protein kinase B (AKT), phosphorylated AKT (pAKT), extracellular signal regulated kinase (ERK1/2), phosphorylated ERK1/2 (pERK1/2) as well as PD-L1 were assessed by western blotting and immunohistochemistry. Results The FFAE of krill oil significantly inhibited cell migration compared to ethanol-treated (vehicle control) cells (P < 0.01 to P < 0.001). At the molecular level, krill oil extract reduced the expression of EGFR, pEGFR (P < 0.001 for both) and their downstream signalling, pERK1/2 and pAKT (P < 0.01 to P < 0.001) without altering total ERK 1/2 and AKT levels. In addition, the expression of PD-L1 was reduced by 67 to 72% (P < 0.001) following the treatment with krill oil extract. Conclusion This study has demonstrated that krill oil may be a potential therapeutic/adjunctive agent for CRC attributed to its anti-migratory effects.. The potential anti-cancer properties of krill oil are likely to be associated with the downregulation of EGFR, pEGFR and their downstream pERK/ERK1/2 and pAKT/AKT signalling pathways along with the downregulation of PD-L1.

However, the precision of the backscattered signal measured by single ADCP measurement has a limitation in the MVBS variation of zooplankton. The objectives of this study were to analyze the MVBS and vertical velocity from ADCPs at the same time and location for zooplankton's daily vertical migration (DVM) observation. Measurements were conducted in Lembeh Strait, North Sulawesi, Indonesia. Instruments used included a moored ADCP 750 kHz and a mobile ADCP 307.2 kHz. High MVBS value was found at 11.5-16 m depths and was identified as the sound scattering layer (SSL). The DVM patterns in the SSL displayed significant differences over time and had good relationships with the diurnal cycle. Theoretical target strength (TS) from the scattering models based on a distorted-wave Born approximation (DWBA) was estimated for Oithona sp. and Paracalanus sp.; the two dominant species found in the observed area. However, MVBS and TS proved that the dominant zooplankton species were not the main scatterers. The strong signal in SSL was instead caused by the schools of various zooplankton species.

Phytoplankton composition and abundance in relation to free-floating Antarctic icebergs	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY												Free-drifting icebergs in the Weddell Sea are expected to affect the surrounding marine ecosystem. Sampling associated with iceberg C-18a, a large tabular, free-drifting iceberg in the NW Weddell Sea, carried out from 10 March to 7 April 2009, was designed to test the hypothesis that the iceberg's presence modified phytoplankton composition and abundance. Areas that define a gradient of possible iceberg influence were sampled for phytoplankton: stations close ( < 1 km) and far (18 km) from iceberg C-18a, an area with numerous small icebergs, Iceberg Alley, and a control site 74 km away. Quantitative samples were obtained from Niskin bottles and counted with an inverted microscope for species abundance. Qualitative samples were collected with nets from the ship's seawater intake. Taxonomic determinations were performed with light and electron microscopy. Overall, diatoms dominated in the mixed layer (surface-similar to 40 m) and unidentified small flagellated and coccid cells at depth (similar to 100 m). Fragilariopsis nana, a diatom 2.4-15.5 mu m in length, dominated numerically the phytoplankton and was most abundant at the control area. The iceberg's effect on phytoplankton composition was consistent with the hypothesis that they facilitate phytoplankton communities enriched in diatoms, as found in other productive areas of Antarctica. Near the iceberg, diatoms were most abundant, principally at depth, while small flagellate concentration diminished. However, total phytoplankton abundance was lowest at Iceberg Alley in the area of highest meltwater contribution, as indicated by low mean temperature in the mixed layer, and highest at the control site. These results suggest that during austral fall, low growth or high zooplankton grazing could be counteracting the positive effect by icebergs on phytoplankton biomass, otherwise observed in summer months.

Population demography and spatial distribution of the mantis shrimp Squilla biformis (Stomatopoda, Squillidae) from Pacific Costa Rica	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												The mantis shrimp Squilla biformis is the most conspicuous and abundant stomatopod captured during benthic trawling operations off the Pacific coast of Costa Rica. Due to its abundance, this species is considered a potential fisheries resource for the region. Nevertheless, its life history is practically unknown. The present study describes the population demography, spatial distribution and behaviour of S. biformis from Pacific Costa Rica. The population was principally composed of individuals between 20 and 32 mm carapace length (CL), forming 2 age groups. Individuals of 35 to 45 mm CL and > 45 mm CL were poorly represented. We assume that larger individuals are more frequent at greater depths (probably on the continental slope), thus out of the reach of the fishing vessels used in our study. Males outnumbered females, as observed in other stomatopods. Visual evidence of their behaviour demonstrates that the adults in this species possess a benthic and pelagic life style. Largest numbers of individuals (50% of the total) were found between 240 to 260 m, the same bathymetric range that was historically occupied by commercial shrimps. This shift may be related to intense fishing activities. We observed a synchronized moulting of females and males during less luminous (third and fourth) lunar phases. The evolutionary development of a group moulting system could confer advantages to S. biformis in comparison to other stomatopods whose moulting process is individual and asynchronous.

Krill densities were obtained by converting relationships of volume backscattering strengths at multiple frequencies to a numerical density using an estimate of krill target strength. Krill data were vertically integrated in 25 m depth bins between 0 and 300 m to obtain water column biomass (g m(-2)) and translated to density surfaces using ordinary kriging. Standard regression models (Generalized Additive Modeling, GAM, and Generalized Linear Modeling, GLM) were developed to identify important explanatory variables relating the presence, absence, and density of large whales to the physical and biological environment and different survey platforms. Large baleen whales were concentrated in 3 focal areas: (1) the northern edge of Lille Hellefiske bank between 65 and 67 degrees N, (2) north of Paamiut at 63 degrees N, and (3) in South Greenland between 60 and 61 degrees N. There was a bimodal pattern of mean krill density between depths, with one peak between 50 and 75 m (mean 0.75 g m(-2), SD 2.74) and another between 225 and 275 m (mean 1.2 to 1.3 g m(-2), SD 23 to 19). Water column krill biomass was 3 times higher in South Greenland than at any other site along the coast. Total depth-integrated krill biomass was 1.3 x 10(9) (CV 0.11). Models indicated the most important parameter in predicting large baleen whale presence was integrated krill abundance, although this relationship was only significant for sightings obtained on the ship survey. This suggests that a high degree of spatio-temporal synchrony in observations is necessary for quantifying predator prey relationships. Krill biomass was most predictive of whale presence at depths >150 m, suggesting a threshold depth below which it is energetically optimal for baleen whales to forage on krill in West Greenland.																	0171-8630	1616-1599					2010	402						269	284		10.3354/meps08423							WOS:000276021700021						
J	GIBBONS, MJ; PILLAR, SC; STUART, V				GIBBONS, MJ; PILLAR, SC; STUART, V			SELECTIVE CARNIVORY BY EUPHASIA-LUCENS	CONTINENTAL SHELF RESEARCH												Stomach contents of adult Euphausia lucens were analysed to determine what criteria this euphausiid uses to select copepod prey. The results indicate that although E. lucens of all sizes ingest a wide range of prey sizes at apparently ambient proportions, small copepods (e.g. Oithona) are consistently consumed in greater than ambient amounts. Small copepods (especially Oithona) are known to move slowly, and have been shown to be more susceptible to predation via negative pressure than larger copepods. In the presence of an abundant phytoplankton food supply and in an otherwise generally non-selective diet, we conclude that such copepod selection by E. lucens is passive. This is in line with the idea of a non-hunting, preferentially herbivorous zooplankter.																	0278-4343					JUL	1991	11	7					625	640		10.1016/0278-4343(91)90016-Y							WOS:A1991GC07700004

Automated classification of schools of the silver cyprinid Rastrineobola argentea in Lake Victoria acoustic survey data using random forests	ICES JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE												Biomass of the schooling fish Rastrineobola argentea (dagaa) is presently estimated in Lake Victoria by acoustic survey following the simple "rule" that dagaa is the source of most echo energy returned from the top third of the water column. Dagaa have, however, been caught in the bottom two-thirds, and other species occur towards the surface: a more robust discrimination technique is required. We explored the utility of a school-based random forest (RF) classifier applied to 120kHz data from a lake-wide survey. Dagaa schools were first identified manually using expert opinion informed by fishing. These schools contained a lake-wide biomass of 0.68 million tonnes (MT). Only 43.4% of identified dagaa schools occurred in the top third of the water column, and 37.3% of all schools in the bottom two-thirds were classified as dagaa. School metrics (e.g. length, echo energy) for 49081 manually classified dagaa and non-dagaa schools were used to build an RF school classifier. The best RF model had a classification test accuracy of 85.4%, driven largely by school length, and yielded a biomass of 0.71 MT, only c. 4% different from the manual estimate. The RF classifier offers an efficient method to generate a consistent dagaa biomass time series.

Large-scale oceanographic fluctuations drive Antarctic petrel survival and reproduction	ECOGRAPHY												Polar Regions are experiencing environmental changes at unprecedented rates. These changes can spread throughout entire food webs from lower trophic levels to apex predators. As many top predators forage over large areas, these indirect effects may be associated with large-scale patterns of climate variability. Using global climate indices that are known to impact the Southern Ocean ecosystem (the El Nino Southern Oscillation and Antarctic Oscillation Indices) we assessed their efficacy to predict variation in the demographic parameters of Antarctic seabirds. First, we used a long-term dataset on adult survival (estimated from capture-mark-recapture data) and reproduction of Antarctic petrel Thalassoica antarctica, from the largest known breeding colony (Svarthamaren, Dronning Maud Land) and examined whether large-scale oceanographic fluctuations impact survival and reproduction. Second, we conducted an exhaustive literature review to determine whether the effects of large-scale environmental variability on Antarctic seabirds have a coherent fingerprint across the Antarctic continent and nearby islands. We found that most of the variation in both reproductive success, timing of hatching, and survival of Antarctic petrels can be accurately modeled using the two modes of large-scale climate variability in Antarctica. The literature review, combined with the results from our field study, suggests that while the anticipated trends in the global patterns of climatic variability will generally have detrimental effects on populations of top predators in the Southwest Atlantic, these conclusions cannot be extrapolated to all seabird populations in Antarctica without additional data.

J	Jarman, SN; Nicol, S				Jarman, SN; Nicol, S			Sources of variance in studies of krill population genetics	CCAMLR SCIENCE												There has been a long-term interest in the population genetics of Antarctic krill species because of their ecological and economic importance. The possibility that there are distinct genetic stocks of these species would affect the design of management strategies for their conservation. A recent resurgence of interest in identifying distinct stocks of swarming krill species has been driven by the development of genetic technologies that are more sensitive to subtle population structure than older methods. Previous studies of the population genetics of the Antarctic species Euphausia crystallorophias and E. superba and the boreal species Meganyctiphanes norvegica that used allozymes found no evidence of genetic population structure. More recent investigations using sequence variation in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) have exposed genetic differentiation between samples taken from different parts of each species' range. However, the underlying assumption of these studies that differentiation between samples is caused primarily by restricted gene flow between widely separated sampling sites may be incorrect. Our recent study of E. crystallorophias mtDNA variation has indicated that there is significant genetic differentiation between samples taken within one region. This has important implications for the design of future studies of krill population genetics, which must be able to accommodate this sympatric variance component as well as variance attributable to differences between regions. Genetic differentiation between stocks of krill in different regions therefore can not be adequately assessed unless multiple samples are taken from each region.

The present study was aimed at corroborating whether fluctuations in abundance could be related to sonic life history parameters considered as indicators of growth rate in salp populations, such as the body size of solitary reproductive individuals, number of buds per block or chain in the stolon, and the offspring to parent ratio. No differences were observed in the sizes reached by aggregate individuals, or in the size at which oocyte maturity was attained (moment at which the development of the embryo can be detected). There were no differences in the size reached by the embryos during their residence inside the mother's blastozooid. In 1995, the percentage of non-fecundated blastozooids (which included even the largest individuals) was higher than in 1994. The mean size of the solitary individuals was significantly higher in 1994 than in 1995. The number of buds per block was also significantly higher in most of the stages, confirming that this is the mechanism used by these organisms to produce swarms. This species eventually attains high population densities under favourable environmental conditions such as poor sea-ice cover in winter. Under optimal conditions, the number of potential descendants produced by a single solitary individual would exceed 800.

J	Alonzo, SH; Mangel, M				Alonzo, SH; Mangel, M			Survival strategies and growth of krill: avoiding predators in space and time	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												Although Antarctic krill live in a relatively harsh and variable environment, they are extremely abundant and occur across a wide geographic range. Krill are also the dominant prey item for a variety of predators ranging from fish to whales. Thus, krill Life histories and survival strategies represent an interesting and biologically relevant theoretical question: How do krill survive and what makes them so successful? The factors that influence krill size and spatial distributions and life-history patterns are not generally understood. We present a conceptual framework for studying krill life histories and patterns of distribution. This approach uses what is known about krill physiology and environmental conditions within an evolutionary framework to increase our understanding of hill distributions and abundance. Using a dynamic state-variable model, we determined the factors predicted to affect the distribution of krill among habitats and feeding behavior of krill. Habitats vary in their associated survival, predation risk, food availability, and metabolic costs. Existing data on variation in temperature, phytoplankton abundance, metabolic costs, growth rates and predator behavior are used to parameterize the model. The model predicts that krill will shrink when experiencing extreme temperatures or food deprivation (under negative energy budgets), but we also predict that krill may shrink due to predation risk (under positive energy budgets). Furthermore, predation patterns are predicted to strongly influence krill size and spatial distributions. If predation risk is size-dependent, krill are predicted to shrink between reproductive events which reduces predation. Differences between habitats in predation risk may cause krill, to shift away from risky habitats even if this slows growth. In the presence of predation risk when feeding, krill are predicted to experience a tradeoff between growth and survival and shift their feeding behavior and habitat distribution accordingly. Differences between habitats in water temperature and travel costs are also predicted to cause size-dependent shifts in habitat use and migration behavior. Our results reinforce the importance of predator behavior on krill life histories, growth, and distributions. Patterns of predation risk may be the key to understanding krill distribution in space, time and size.																	0171-8630						2001	209						203	217		10.3354/meps209203							WOS:000166834500017

The dominance of this particular group over diatoms affects grazers, such as Antarctic krill, which preferentially feed on diatoms. Using three late summer data sets from the Bransfield Strait (2008-2010), we observed variations in the dominant phytoplankton groups determined by HPLC/CHEMTAX pigment analysis and confirmed by microscopy. Results indicate that the dominance of diatoms, particularly in 2008 and 2009, was associated with a deeper upper mixed layer (UML), higher salinity and warmer sea surface temperature. In contrast, cryptophytes, which were dominant in 2010, were associated with a shallower UML, lower salinity and colder sea surface temperatures. The low diatom biomass observed in the summer of 2010 was associated with high nutrient concentration, particularly silicate, and low chlorophyll a (summer monthly average calculated from satellite images). The interannual variability here observed suggests a delayed seasonal succession cycle of phytoplankton in the summer of 2010 associated with a cold summer and a late ice retreat process in the region. This successional delay resulted in a notable decrease of primary producers' biomass, which is likely to have impacted regional food web interactions. This study demonstrates the susceptibility of the Antarctic phytoplankton community structure to air temperature, which directly influences the timing of ice melting and consequently the magnitude of primary production and succession pattern of phytoplankton groups.				de Souza, Marcio Silva/AAR-5757-2021; Brotas, Vanda/A-2410-2012; Tavano, Virginia/C-5241-2013; Garcia, Carlos A.

The distributions of zooplankton biomass, abundance, and taxonomic composition at six locations on or near the continental shelf at Marguerite Bay were determined for fall and winter, 2001, as a part of the Southern Ocean GLOBEC program. Water column zooplankton were sampled using a 1-m(2) MOCNESS. Samples were analyzed for taxonomic composition, size, and estimated biomass using silhouette analysis. Characteristics of four categories (small and large copepods, small and large krill) were described in detail. Total biomass and abundance were markedly reduced in winter relative to fall. The vertical distributions of total abundance and biomass, and of taxonomic composition, were associated with the hydrographic structure of the water column. Larger larval krill were observed at all locations during winter than during fall. Krill were relatively unimportant to total biomass and abundance at most locations, while copepods frequently dominated both biomass and abundance. In fall, greatest abundance and biomass of larval krill were observed on the continental shelf in association with a persistent clockwise gyre located to the west of Adelaide Island. During winter, much lower abundances of larval krill were present in the water column throughout the study region. High abundance and biomass of juvenile and adult krill were observed only in Laubeuf Fjord (Marguerite Bay) during fall. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

There was a significant correlation between the independently measured individual growth rates and the RNA : DNA ratio and also the RNA concentration of krill tissue, although the strength of the relationship was only modest. DNA concentration, on average, was relatively constant, irrespective of the growth rates. The moult stage did not appear to have a significant effect on the nucleic acid contents of tissue. Overall, the amount of both nucleic acids varied considerably between individuals. Nucleic acid-based indicators may provide information concerning the recent growth and nutritional status of krill and further experimentation under controlled conditions is warranted.

Elephant seals (Mirounga leonine) from the Kerguelen Islands (49 degrees 20'S, 70 degrees 20'E) have several different foraging strategies. Why some individuals undertake long trips to the Antarctic continent while others utilize the relatively close frontal zones is poorly understood. Here, we investigate how physical properties within the sea ice zone are linked to foraging activities of southern elephant seals (SES). To do this, we first developed a new approach using indices of foraging derived from high temporal resolution dive and accelerometry data to predict foraging behaviour in an extensive, low resolution dataset from CTD-Satellite Relay Data Loggers (CTD-SRDLs). A sample of 37 post-breeding SES females were used to construct a predictive model applied to demersal and pelagic dive strategies relating prey encounter events (PEE) to dive parameters (dive duration, bottom duration, hunting-time, maximum depth, ascent speed, descent speed, sinuosity, and horizontal speed) for each strategy. We applied these models to a second sample of 35 seals, 20 males and 15 females, during the post-moult foraging trip to the Antarctic continental shelf between 2004 and 2013, which did not have fine-scale behavioural data. The females were widely distributed with important foraging activity south of the Southern Boundary Front, while males predominately travelled to the south-eastern part of the East Antarctica region. Combining our predictions of PEE with environmental features (sea ice concentration, water masses at the bottom phase of dives, bathymetry and slope index) we found higher foraging activity for females over shallower seabed depths and at the boundary between the overlying Antarctic Surface Water (AASW) and the underlying Modified Circumpolar Deep Water (MCDW). Increased biological activity associated with the upper boundary of MCDW, may provide overwintering areas for SES prey. Male foraging activity was strongly associated with pelagic dives within the Antarctic Slope Front where upwelling of nutrient rich Circumpolar Deep Water onto surface water may enhance and concentrate resources. A positive association between sea ice and foraging activity was found for both sexes where increased biological activity may sustain an under-ice ecosystem. Variability of the East Antarctic sea ice season duration is likely a crucial element to allow air-breathing predators to benefit from profitable prey patches within the pack ice habitat.

This paper reports on variation in beak colour of the gentoo penguin, Pygoscelis papua, corresponding to different geographical locations along a latitudinal gradient in the Antarctic Peninsula (from King George Island (62A(0)15'S-58A(0)37'W) to Rong, Island (64A(0)40'S-62A(0)40'W). The gentoo penguin has a conspicuous red spot on both sides of the beak that indicates the presence of the carotenoid pigment, astaxanthin. Beak colouration was measured with a portable spectrophotometer for 20 individuals in three locations, along the Western coast of the Antarctic Peninsula. In the study area, marked variation can be found in terms of factors such us parasite load, human impact, variations in UV radiation and the abundance of krill; all possibly affecting carotenoid availability for signalling purposes. Colour traits were expected to be more intense, that is more vivid, saturated and pure, in places where there is diminished pressure from factors such as contamination, parasites or diseases, all of which may reduce the availability of carotenoids for other functions, such as antioxidant or immune stimulation involving physiological trade-offs. Likewise, colour traits might be predicted to be more intense where carotenoid sources, krill in the case of gentoo penguins, are more available. However, contrary to this initial expectation, our results indicate that northerly penguins' populations, which are in the most polluted and parasitized areas, have more saturated beaks. An alternative hypothesis suggests that environmental constraints relating to the variation in abundance of krill may explain the geographical variation in colour expression found among gentoo penguins.

Using passive acoustics to model blue whale habitat off the Western Antarctic Peninsula	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY												Habitat preferences of calling blue whales were investigated using data from two multidisciplinary oceanographic cruises conducted off the Western Antarctic Peninsula (WAP) during the austral falls of 2001 and 2002. Data were collected on depth, temperature, salinity, chlorophyll a (Chl-a) concentration, krill biomass, zooplankton abundance, and blue whale call presence. In 2001, the study area was sea ice free, high Chl-a concentrations occurred over a small area, krill biomass and zooplankton abundance were high, and few blue whale calls were detected. In 2002 the sea ice covered the southern part of the survey area. Chl-a was high over a large area, krill and zooplankton were low, and there were more blue whale calls. Logistic regression analysis revealed blue whale calls were positively correlated with depth and SST, and negatively correlated with the mean zooplankton abundance from 101 to 300 m and the mean krill biomass in the top 100 m. The negative correlation between blue whale calls and zooplankton could occur if feeding animals do not produce calls. Our survey area did not cover the full range of blue whale habitat off the WAP, as blue whales probably follow the melting and freezing ice edge through this region. Passive acoustics can provide insight to mesoscale habitat use by blue whales in the Southern Ocean where visual sightings are rare, but the ability to localize on the calling animals would greatly improve the ability to model at a finer scale.

Results from regional surveys around Elephant Island in 1994/95 and 1996/97 seasons also were examined. During the CCAMLR 2000 Survey, salp abundance was higher in the Antarctic Peninsula and South Sandwich Island areas than in the central Scotia Sea. The probable reason for this pattern is a negative relationship with phytoplankton abundance; the central Scotia Sea having greater phytoplankton concentrations than required for optimal salp filter-feeding performance. Cluster analysis of salp size composition resulted in three cluster groups for each of the three surveys. Clusters comprising large salps occurred in warmer waters in all three surveys. The size composition of the salp populations suggests that the timing of intense asexual reproductive budding was earlier in warmer waters. As surface water temperatures generally decrease from north to south, and increase from spring to summer, the general spatio-temporal pattern of asexual reproduction by budding is likely to proceed from north to south as the summer season progresses.

In this study, the enzymatic characterization of chitinase 3C (EcChi3C) of Exopalaemon carinicauda was analyzed. In addition, we analyzed the expression profiles of EcChi3C at different tissues and different molting stages. In the all tested tissues, it was predominantly expressed in hepatopancreas, and then stomach, but poor in other tissues. In all tested molting periods, it was mainly expressed in intermolt and molting stages, but poor in other stages. The results of molting, mortality and the uropod ultrastructure of prawns after being injected with EcChi3C dsRNA were in accordance with those of the control group. In addition, there is no difference for endopodite morphology between the survival and dead individuals in experimental group. After being challenged with bacteria, the expression ofEcChi3C was up-regulated significantly at 12 h and followed with a comeback at 96 h. These results suggest that EcChi3C is an important immune related gene but not a necessary gene in the molting process of E. carinicauda. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

We tracked adult macaroni penguins from a colony in South Georgia using global location sensors to determine winter distribution, and bioenergetics models to calculate the biomass of food consumed during the winter period. We combined these to produce a surface of the tonnes of krill consumed, which could be compared directly with the spatial distribution of the tonnes of krill caught by the fishery. Results Adult macaroni penguins from South Georgia consumed 135,826 tonnes of krill (95% CIs: 83,446-188,140) during the winter, which is similar to the 98,431 tonnes caught by fisheries over the same period. However, macaroni penguins had a very wide pelagic distribution across the Scotia Sea, whereas the fishery was restricted to three small areas on shelf edges, such that their spatial overlap was negligible. The proportion of the estimated krill stock taken by macaroni penguins and the krill fishery was small at both the scale of the Scotia Sea and the local areas within which the fisheries operate. Main conclusions Competition between macaroni penguins and the krill fishery is low under current management and far less than that among the various species of krill predators that occur in the Scotia Sea. Our method will allow quantification of changes in competition between macaroni penguins and krill fisheries should the latter expand in the future, and provides a framework for assessing predator-fishery competition in other systems.

Responses of Antarctic pack-ice seals to environmental change and increasing krill fishing	BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION												The compound effects of changing habitats, ecosystem interactions, and fishing practices have implications for the management of Antarctic krill and conservation of its predators. For Antarctic pack-ice seals, an important group of krill predators, we estimate the density and krill consumption in the West Antarctic Peninsula (WAP)-Western Weddell Sea area, the main fishery region; and we consider long-term changes in suitable pack-ice habitat, increased fishing pressure and potential krill declines based upon predictions from declines in sea ice cover. More than 3 million crabeater seals consumed over 12 million tonnes of krill each year. This was approximately 17% of the krill standing stock. The highest densities of pack ice seals where found in the WAP, including in its small-scale fishery management areas, where apparently suitable seal habitat has declined by 21-28% over a 30 year period, where krill density is likely to have declined, and fishing has increased. The highest seal density was found in the Marguerite Bay area which is a source of krill for the Antarctic Peninsula and elsewhere. Significant sea-ice loss since 1979 has already occurred, leading to open water and possible expansion for the fishery in the future. These factors may combine to potentially reduce food for pack ice seals. Therefore, high uncertainty in krill and seal stock trends and in their environmental drivers call for a precautionary management of the krill fishery, in the absence of survey data to support management based on specific conservation objectives for pack-ice seals.

A global estimation of mesozooplankton ammonium excretion in the open ocean	JOURNAL OF PLANKTON RESEARCH												Mesozooplankton ammonium excretion rates in the ocean, based on published data, were studied across all latitudes in order to assess the amount of ammonium excretion by this community. Specific ammonium excretion rates were highest in equatorial waters and decreased rapidly pole-ward. Global community excretion in the upper 200 m of the oceans, integrated over all latitudes, accounted in general for 1.78 +/- 0.60 Gt N center dot year(-1). Excretion rates showed a decrease from tropical (0.65 +/- 0.14 Gt N center dot year(-1)) to polar waters (0.05 +/- 0.02 Gt N center dot year(-1)). The substrate metabolized by organisms as indicated by the O/N ratio showed a protein-based metabolism of mesozooplankton with the exception of the temperate and subpolar regions, which showed a more lipid-based metabolism. The largest contribution of ammonium to autotrophs was observed in the tropical and subtropical areas, decreasing to polar areas. On a global basis, nutrient regeneration by mesozooplankton in the oceanic realm was estimated to be in the range of 12-23% of the requirements for phytoplankton and bacterial production.

Salpa thompsoni in the Indian Sector of the Southern Ocean: Environmental drivers and life history parameters	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY												The Southern Ocean ecosystem is thought to be experiencing a long-term increase in Salpa thompsoni. Uncertainty surrounds the environmental drivers behind variable S. thompsoni abundances, particularly within the East Antarctic region. In this study, S. thompsoni populations were sampled in the Indian Sector of the Southern Ocean, as part of the January-February 2016 Kerguelen Axis voyage. These recent data were compared against historical density records in the broader Kerguelen Plateau region from voyages during 1985-2006. Results show that 2016 maximum S. thompsoni densities across the Kerguelen Plateau were higher, and more southerly located, than those previously sampled in the area. The highest 2016 S. thompsoni abundances exceeded 2500 individuals 1000 m(-3) and were located between the Southern Boundary of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current and the Southern Antarctic Circumpolar Current Front. The life-stage composition of S. thompsoni comprised approximately 90% aggregates (blastozooids) and 10% solitaries (oozoids). Generalised Additive Models associated low chlorophyll-a concentration and low solar elevation (outside of peak daylight) with higher S. thompsoni abundances. In addition, elevated abundances occurred in locations from where the sea ice retreated at least eight weeks previously. These abundance-environment relationships are consistent with results from several previous surveys in the region and the West Antarctic. Due to the complex life cycle of S. thompsoni, and the unpredictability of their distribution patterns, multi-seasonal and multi-year surveys are needed to confirm whether the 2016 distribution patterns are indicative of a long-term increase or southerly shift in abundances. The new information from this study provides much needed baseline abundance and distribution data (which can be used to assess future change in a currently understudied oceanographic region) on a species capable of shaping the future ecosystem structure and function in the Indian Sector of the Southern Ocean.

Water temperature correlates with baleen whale foraging behaviour at multiple scales in the Antarctic	MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH												How baleen whales locate prey and how environmental change may influence whale foraging success are not well understood. Baleen whale foraging habitat has largely been described at a population level, yet population responses to change are the result of individual strategies across multiple scales. This study aimed to determine how the foraging behaviour of individual whales varied relative to environmental conditions along their movement path. Biotelemetry devices provided information on humpback whale (Megaptera novaeangliae) movement at two spatial scales in East Antarctica, and a mixed modelling approach was used at a medium scale (tens of kilometres) to determine which environmental factors correlated with a change in foraging behaviour. Water temperature was linked to a change in foraging behaviour at both spatial scales. At the medium scale, warmer water was associated with the resident state, commonly assumed to represent periods of foraging behaviour. However, fine-scale analyses suggested that cooler water was associated with a higher feeding rate. Variation in whale foraging behaviour with changes in water temperature adds support to the hypothesis that whales may be able to track environmental conditions to find prey. Future research should investigate this pattern further, given the predicted rise in water temperatures under climate-change scenarios.																	1323-1650	1448-6059					2019	70	1					19	32		10.1071/MF17288							WOS:000453226400003

Research efforts to evaluate the impact of this phenomenon have focused on phytoplankton under the assumption that ecosystem effects will most likely originate through reductions in primary productivity; however, phytoplankton do not represent the only significant component in ecosystem response to elevated UVB. Antarctic bacterioplankton are adversely affected by UVB exposure; and invertebrates and fish, particularly early developmental stages that reside in the plankton, are sensitive to UVB. There is little Information available on UV responses of larger Antarctic marine animals (e.g., birds, seals and whales). Understanding the balance between direct biological damage and species-specific potentials for UV tolerance (protection and recovery) relative to trophic dynamics and biogeochemical cycling is a crucial factor in evaluating the overall impact of ozone depletion. After more than a decade of research, much Information has been gathered about UV-photobiology in Antarctica; however, a definitive quantitative assessment of the effect of ozone depletion on the Antarctic ecosystem still eludes us. It is only obvious that ozone depletion has not had a catastrophic effect in the Antarctic region. The long-term consequences of possible subtle shifts In species composition and trophic interactions are still uncertain.																	0003-1569					FEB	2001	41	1					3	16		10.1668/0003-1569(2001)041[0003:IOORII]2.0.CO;2							WOS:000172505600002

Low trophic mesopelagic biomasses have the potential to sustainably supplement aquafeed demands for increased seafood production. The present study is a theoretical whole-chain feed and food safety assessment on ingredients from mesopelagic biomass and the resulting farmed fish fed these ingredients, based on analysis of processed mesopelagic biomass. Earlier theoretical estimations have indicated that several undesirable compounds (e.g., dioxins and metals and fluoride) would exceed the legal maximum levels for feed and food safety. Our measurements on processed mesopelagic biomasses show that only fluoride exceeds legal feed safety limits. Due to high levels of fluoride in crustaceans, their catch proportion will dictate the fluoride level in the whole biomass and can be highly variable. Processing factors are established that can be used to estimate the levels of undesirables in mesopelagic aquafeed ingredients from highly variable species biomass catches. Levels of most the studied undesirables (dioxins, PCBs, organochlorine pesticides, brominated flame retardant, metals, metalloids) were generally low compared to aquafeed ingredients based on pelagic fish. Using a feed-to-fillet aquaculture transfer model, the use of mesopelagic processed aquafeed ingredients was estimated to reduce the level of dioxins and PCBs by similar to 30% in farmed seafood such as Atlantic salmon.

Average mesozooplankton biomass was 86.45 +/- 56.74 mg dry weight m(-2). which is in the lower range of the values cited in the literature for polar waters. Higher biomass was observed in the Weddell water. The small size fraction accounted for about 50% of total biomass while the largest one represented 35%. Rather high metabolic rates were found, irrespective of whether the organisms were incubated in the presence of food. No significant differences were observed in mass specific respiration and ammonia excretion rates between different temperatures of incubation (0.2-2.3 degrees C) and between the size classes studied. Because of the very low biomass values observed, the metabolic requirements of I nesozooplankton during December represented a small fraction of the primary production.

THE CERTAINTY OF UNCERTAINTY IN MARINE CONSERVATION AND WHAT TO DO ABOUT IT	BULLETIN OF MARINE SCIENCE												The confounding effects of difficult sampling and dynamic systems make uncertainty the norm for managers of marine ecosystems. Thus managers need approaches that use relatively small amounts of information and account for a wide suite of biological and physical influences. Here we use a case study approach to review the use of several possible techniques for making decisions about marine ecosystems despite uncertainty. We describe the use of expert judgment in the rebuilding plans for data-poor US fisheries, models to manage the krill fishery in the Southern Ocean to account for both the impacts of climate change and the resource needs of krill predators, an integrated risk assessment framework to prioritize shark management in the Atlantic Ocean despite severe data limitations, and models to account for climate impacts on salmonid populations in California. Through this review, we show that with limited information, managers can use models to explore how highly variable systems might respond to management options under different scenarios. Expert judgment can help shape the assumptions that form the basis for those models and propose sensible boundaries within which management options can be developed. A weight of evidence approach can take advantage of small amounts of information from multiple sources, including models and expert judgment. Although none of these approaches is perfect, they can help provide a logical starting point for conservation and management, despite the certainty of uncertainty.

To evaluate differences in the foraging habitat of these two species, we recorded their foraging locations and diving behavior using recently developed GPS-depth data loggers. The study was conducted on King George Island, Antarctica during the chick-guarding period of both species, from December 2006 to January 2007. The area used for foraging, estimated as the 95% kernel density of dive (> 5 m) locations, overlapped partially between the two species (26.4 and 68.5% of the area overlapped for chinstrap and gentoo penguins, respectively). However, the core foraging area, estimated as the 50% kernel density, was mostly separate (12.8 and 25.0% of the area overlapped for chinstrap and gentoo penguins, respectively). Chinstrap penguins tended to use off-shelf (water depth > 200 m) regions (77% of the locations for dives > 5 m), whereas gentoo penguins mainly used on-shelf (water depth < 200 m) areas (71% of dive locations). The data on foraging locations, diving behavior, and bathymetry indicated that gentoo penguins often performed benthic dives (28% of dives > 5 m), whereas chinstrap penguins almost always used the epipelagic/mid-water layer (96% of dives > 5 m). Diving parameters such as diving bottom duration or diving efficiency differed between the species, reflecting differences in the use of foraging habitat. The diving parameters also suggested that the on-shelf benthic layer was profitable foraging habitat for gentoo penguins. Conversely, the relationship between trip duration, date, and stomach content mass suggested that the chinstrap penguins went further from the colony to forage as the season progressed, possibly reflecting a reduction in prey availability near the colony. Our results suggest that chinstrap and gentoo penguins segregated their foraging habitat in the Antarctic coastal marine environment, possibly due to inter- and intra-specific competition for common prey resources.																	0025-3162	1432-1793				APR	2010	157	4					811	825		10.1007/s00227-009-1364-1							WOS:000275658000012

Feeding aquaculture in an era of finite resources	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA												Aquaculture's pressure on forage fisheries remains hotly contested. This article reviews trends in fishmeal and fish oil use in industrial aquafeeds, showing reduced inclusion rates but greater total use associated with increased aquaculture production and demand for fish high in long-chain omega-3 oils. The ratio of wild fisheries inputs to farmed fish output has fallen to 0.63 for the aquaculture sector as a whole but remains as high as 5.0 for Atlantic salmon. Various plant-and animal-based alternatives are now used or available for industrial aquafeeds, depending on relative prices and consumer acceptance, and the outlook for single-cell organisms to replace fish oil is promising.

Trophic mediation and ecosystem stability: An assessment using qualitative network models	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Nontrophic interactions can contribute to negative and positive feedbacks within a community, thus affecting likelihood of regime shifts; however, assessing the nature and importance of these effects in a network remains challenging, especially for pelagic ecosystems. Here, we present a qualitative modeling approach for assessing the importance of different effects and resultant feedbacks for community stability, using a Southern Ocean example. A potentially important positive feedback in the Southern Ocean ecosystem involves production of a chemical cue, dimethyl sulfide (DMS), by some phytoplankton. Production of DMS can promote phytoplankton growth by attracting predators of phytoplankton-grazers, and nutrients released as feces from those predators help fertilize the water column. We explored how uncertainties in the nature of this feedback affect community stability in a set of small, community models. We found that stability varied substantially depending on how the community was modeled, but that the interactions most important for determining stability were consistent across all models. Model stability was sensitive to the strength of phytoplankton competition, controls on phytoplankton, DMS production and release, and predator attraction to DMS, suggesting that the community could be destabilized by perturbation affecting these interactions. Incorporating DMS-mediated feedbacks into a larger Southern Ocean network had a moderate impact on stability characteristics and altered the trophic level at which the system would be most vulnerable to perturbation.

It is a physically energetic region with some of the highest levels of productivity in the Southern Ocean. It is also a region within which there have been greater than average levels of change in upper water column temperature. We describe the results of three cruises transecting the central Scotia Sea from south to north in consecutive years and covering spring, summer and autumn periods. We also report on some community level syntheses using both current-day and historical data from this region. A wide range of parameters were measured during the field campaigns, covering the physical oceanography of the region, air-sea CO2 fluxes, macro- and micronutrient concentrations, the composition and biomass of the nano-, micro- and mesoplankton communities, and the distribution and biomass of Antarctic krill and mesopelagic fish. Process studies examined the effect of iron-stress on the physiology of primary producers, reproduction and egestion in Antarctic krill and the transfer of stable isotopes between trophic layers, from primary consumers up to birds and seals. Community level syntheses included an examination of the biomass-spectra, food-web modelling, spatial analysis of multiple trophic layers and historical species distributions. The spatial analyses in particular identified two distinct community types: a northern warmer water community and a southern cold community, their boundary being broadly consistent with the position of the Southern Antarctic Circumpolar Current Front (SACCF). Temperature and ice cover appeared to be the dominant, over-riding factors in driving this pattern. Extensive phytoplankton blooms were a major feature of the surveys, and were persistent in areas such as South Georgia. In situ and bioassay measurements emphasised the important role of iron inputs as facilitators of these blooms. Based on seasonal DIC deficits, the South Georgia bloom was found to contain the strongest seasonal carbon uptake in the ice-free zone of the Southern Ocean. The surveys also encountered low-production, iron-limited regions, a situation more typical of the wider Southern Ocean. The response of primary and secondary consumers to spatial and temporal heterogeneity in production was complex. Many of the life-cycles of small pelagic organisms showed a close coupling to the seasonal cycle of food availability. For instance, Antarctic krill showed a dependence on early, non-ice-associated blooms to facilitate early reproduction. Strategies to buffer against environmental variability were also examined, such as the prevalence of multiyear life-cycles and variability in energy storage levels. Such traits were seen to influence the way in which Scotia Sea communities were structured, with biomass levels in the larger size classes being higher than in other ocean regions. Seasonal development also altered trophic function, with the trophic level of higher predators increasing through the course of the year as additional predator-prey interactions emerged in the lower trophic levels. Finally, our studies re-emphasised the role that the simple phytoplankton-krill-higher predator food chain plays in this Southern Ocean region, particularly south of the SACCF. To the north, alternative food chains, such as those involving copepods, macrozooplankton and mesopelagic fish, were increasingly important. Continued ocean warming in this region is likely to increase the prevalence of such alternative suchfood chains with Antarctic krill predicted to move southwards. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

On the interannual variability of ocean temperatures around South Georgia, Southern Ocean: Forcing by El Nino/Southern Oscillation and the Southern Annular Mode	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY												The ocean around South Georgia, in the southwest Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean, is highly productive, with large stocks of Antarctic krill supporting extensive colonies of marine- and land-based predators. The operation of this ecosystem is strongly influenced by physical forcings, and the role of the El Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) phenomenon has been highlighted previously. Here we examine in detail the transmission of ENSO signals to South Georgia, and investigate other sources of interannual variability. ENSO variability generates anomalies in sea-surface temperature (SST) across the South Pacific via atmospheric teleconnections. These anomalies are advected toward South Georgia within the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC), and previous studies have focussed on long-period advection (order of 2-3 years) from the southwest Pacific. We observe here, however, that the region close to the Antarctic Peninsula in the southeast Pacific is especially susceptible to ENSO forcing via anomalous meridional winds; this induces SST anomalies that are advected to South Georgia on a much more rapid timescale (order 5-6 months). The phasing of these teleconnections is such that anomalies that reach the southeast Pacific from farther west tend to be reinforced here by air-sea-ice interaction. We also find an important role for the Southern Annular Mode (SAM) in determining SST variability at South Georgia. This is a circumpolar mode of climate variability, and thus can readily influence local SST at South Georgia directly. The SAM is, however, not perfectly zonally symmetric, and (like ENSO) has a particular impact on meridional winds in the southeast Pacific. The average timescale for SAM influence on South Georgia SST is shorter than that of ENSO, since it includes a stronger component of direct local forcing. The South Georgia ecosystem is not self-sustaining, with import of krill from breeding and nursery grounds upstream in the ACC being important. We speculate here that these varying meridional winds close to the Antarctic Peninsula play a direct role in promoting/ restricting the injection of shelf waters (and the krill therein) into the ACC, following which anomalies in krill density would be advected toward South Georgia. This offers a dynamical mechanism that might contribute to interannual changes in biological communities at South Georgia, in addition to existing theories. Both SAM and ENSO have shown long-period changes in recent decades, with ENSO exhibiting a higher preponderance of El Nino events compared with La Nina events, and the SAM showing a marked trend toward a higher index state. Such long-period behaviour is likely to induce changes in the South Georgia ecosystem via their impacts on advection and SST, for which an understanding of the physical mechanisms elucidated here will be key to unravelling.

Emperor penguins Aptenodytes forsteri are reported to be visual hunters, but breed and forage at high latitudes and are thus exposed to extreme changes in light conditions in the course of the year. We examined how light influenced the foraging ability of breeding emperor penguins using loggers in winter (n = 5) and spring (n = 4) 2005 at Pointe Geologie (66 degrees 40' S, 140 degrees 01' E), Antarctica, as well as by using models of light availability over the year and as a function of depth. The model showed that daylight was continuous between days of the year 350 and 363 and that the sun did not rise between days of the year 166 and 180. Logger-measured light intensity decreased with water depth, and depth-specific values were higher at greater sun elevation angles. Depth-time use (given by the maximum depth reached multiplied by the number of hours at which this depth could be achieved over 24 h) of spring-foraging penguins was 8394.5 m x h, which was more than twice that of winter-foraging birds at 3845.4 m x h, showing the severe constraints imposed by winter conditions. Average catch-per-unit effort was related to mean maximum diving depth and was highest around mid-day in winter and highest during dawn and dusk in spring. This reflects availability of prey to foraging emperor penguins.

These data, with those from earlier studies, indicated that there was probably a slowing of lipofuscin accumulation and metabolic rate in large/old individuals between 1 and 2.4 years. The ranges of carapace length and body weight in the 2.4-yr laboratory group fell entirely within those of the 1-yr group. It was impossible to accurately distinguish individual crayfish from these age groups using traditional size criteria. Conversely, there was no overlap in the brain lipofuscin contents of individuals from the two age classes, enabling 100% differentiation on this criterion. Although increasing variation in lipofuscin concentrations and slowing of the accumulation rate with increasing age would lead to widening confidence intervals of age predictions for older individuals, the present results again demonstrate that, at least in these laboratory reared crayfish, lipofuscin is a much better predictor of age than conventionally used size indices. Despite a wide range of ambient water temperatures (7-33-degrees-C, mean 19-degrees-C), the variance of lipofuscin concentrations in the 2.5-yr-old field-grown crayfish was not significantly different from that of similarly aged individuals reared under constant laboratory conditions, suggesting that individuals in the population were relatively cohesive in their response to varying temperatures and that confidence levels for age determinations of field animals might be of the same order as those obtained for laboratory subjects. The results of the present study are further incentive for continuing the evaluation of lipofuscin as an index of crustacean age.																	0022-0981						1992	161	1					79	89		10.1016/0022-0981(92)90191-C							WOS:A1992JV93700007

Collections were made in 50m strata from the surface to 150m depth in an area with a bottom depth of 155-160m. From March 1999 through February 2000 the pelagic community was dominated by krill, primarily Euphausia crystallorophias and E. superba, which made up > 94% of total pelagic biomass on a dry-weight basis. Community composition shifted during early 2000, and samples from May and November 2000 contained a more diverse assemblage and large numbers of cydippid ctenophores, comprising ca. 30-35% of pelagic biomass on a dry weight basis. E. crystallorophias, which made up nearly 85% of the pelagic biomass in November 1999, declined to 5.8% during November 2000. The change in composition was accompanied by displacement of the biomass mode to greater depths, due to the deeper occurrence and lack of die] vertical migration in ctenophores, compared to krill. Integrated water-column biomass increased substantially from 1999 to 2000, primarily because of elevated abundances of gelatinous zooplankton and the presence of significantly larger krill during 2000.

Feeding of dominant zooplankton species at locations across the neritic, slope and oceanic regions of Prydz Bay, Antarctica, was investigated with incubation experiments during austral spring/summer of 2009/2010 to identify the response of dominant copepods and krill to different feeding environments. Results showed distinct spatial and temporal variations in ingestion and filtration of predominant copepods and krill. In late spring, Calanoides acutus was inactive and the ingestion rate was only 1.30 mu gC/ind/day. During early summer, a diatom bloom was in progress at station IS21, showing a peak biomass of Thalassiosira spp. and Fragilaria spp. Daily ingestion rates of Euphausia crystallorophias, C. acutus, Metridia gerlachei and Ctenocalanus citer were relatively high. By contrast, copepod ate predominantly ciliates in slope and oceanic regions where microplankton biomass were lower (< 20 mu gC/L). During late summer, microplankton of neritic regions, mainly composed of nano-sized Pseudo-nitzschia spp. and ciliates, was less than 10 mu gC/L. C. acutus incubated in neritic regions mainly ate ciliates. The total microplankton biomass was lower (< 5 mu gC/L) and predominated by Pseudo-nitzschia spp. in slope regions north of Fram Bank, and daily ingestion rates of incubated copepods were less than 2.5 mu gC/ind. Our results clearly demonstrated that copepods and krill had flexible feeding strategies to cope with temporally and spatially changing food availability in Prydz Bay. Meanwhile, ciliates appeared to represent an important carbon source for zooplankton, especially in regions with lower food concentrations.																	0722-4060	1432-2056				NOV	2013	36	11					1701	1707		10.1007/s00300-013-1387-4							WOS:000326049100016

Distribution, population dynamics and growth rates of Thysanopoda acutifrons, Thysanoessa inermis and Nematobrachion boopis in the Irminger Sea, North Atlantic	JOURNAL OF THE MARINE BIOLOGICAL ASSOCIATION OF THE UNITED KINGDOM												Euphausiids are an important component of the northern North Atlantic ecosystem and several species are found in the Irminger Sea. However, data on euphausiids in this region are few, particularly for Thysanopoda acutifrons, Thysanoessa inermis and Nematobranchion boopis. In this paper, we present the first data since the 1930s on the seasonal distribution and population dynamics of these species from net haul data collected in the Irminger Sea during winter, spring and summer 2001-2002. Thysanoessa inermis was the most numerically abundant (0.63-26.62 ind. 1000 m(-3)) of the three species in the region and comprised a biomass of 3.92-41.74 mg 1000 m(-3). The species was largely found in the upper regions of the water column (0-400 m) and was distributed in the more on-shelf/shelf-break regions around East Greenland and Iceland. Growth rates were around 0.03 mm d(-1) for T. inermis and there was some evidence that either the timing of spawning was delayed, or larval development was prolonged in the region. Thysanopoda acutifrons was predominantly distributed below 400 m in more oceanic regions and had a low abundance (1.23-1.64 ind. 1000 m(-3)) throughout the Irminger Sea. However, the species comprised a relatively high proportion of biomass (19.39-31.33 mg 1000 m(-3)) due to its large body size. Our data showed that the species had low rates of growth (0.04 mm d(-1)) and development throughout the year, and that the reproductive season occurred during the overwintering period (November/December) once individuals had reached two years of age. Nematobranchion boopis mainly occurred below 400 m at low abundance (0.06-0.18 ind. 1000 m(-3)) levels throughout the region. The species was largely found where Atlantic waters prevailed in the Irminger Current and its growth rates were variable (0.02-0.06 mm d(-1)). Nematobranchion boopis was a year-round spawner and the species had fairly rapid rates of post-larval development, with the newly spawned 0-group reaching sexual maturity within the first 6 months. Data presented in this paper provide useful baselines for understanding the possible impacts of long-term, broad-scale environmental change on the ecology of euphausiid communities in the Irminger Sea.

An integrated process of ultrasonic intensification and chitosan co-precipitation was developed for the efficient protein recovery. This process efficiency is influenced by pH, the ratio of water/LHBs and chitosan concentration. Up to 99% lobster head proteins (LHPs) could be ultrasonically extracted within 5 min at a pH of 13 and water to LHBs ratio of 8 mL/g, of which 86.6% LHPs could be recovered by 250 mg/L chitosan co-precipitation. Nutritionally, 83.2% of LHPs are relatively intact proteins (molecular weights 50-150 kDa) enriched with umami, aromas and essential amino acids (EAAs - up to 38.9% - double the amount of adult requirements that is suggested by WHO/FAO), and low lysine/arginine ratio (1.0). The LHPs recovered have digestibility comparable to that of the egg protein and contain significantly lower toxic metals satisfying food safety standards, that makes this novel process and the extracted proteins very attractive for industrial applications.

Use of this boundary condition, along with certain assumptions, allows reduction of what is a very complex scattering problem to a relatively simple, approximate ray-based solution. Because of the diversity of this problem, the formulation is presented in two articles: this first one in which the basic physics of the scattering process is described where the incident sound wave is nearly normally incident upon a single target (i.e., the region in which the scattering amplitude is typically at or near a maximum value for the individual) and the second one [Stanton et al., J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 94, 3463-3472 (1993)] where the formulation is heuristically extended to all angles of incidence and then statistically averaged over a range of angles and target sizes to produce a collective echo involving an aggregation of randomly oriented different sized scatterers. In this article, a simple ray model is employed in the deformed cylinder formulation [Stanton, J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 86, 691-705 (1989)] to describe the scattering by finite length deformed fluid bodies in the general shape of elongated organisms. The work involves single realizations of the length and angle of orientation. Straight and bent finite cylinders and prolate spheroids are treated in separate examples. There is reasonable qualitative comparison between the structure of the data collected by Chu et aL [ICES J. Mar. Sci. 49, 97-106 (1992)] involving two decapod shrimp and this single-target normal-incidence theory. This analysis forms the basis for successful comparison (presented in the companion article) between the extended formulation that is averaged over an ensemble of realizations of length and angle of orientation and scattering data involving aggregations of up to 100's of animals.

Results supported the hypothesis of a functional relationship between egg production and molt development for the duration of the reproductive season (March to August), with one reproductive cycle being made up of two molt cycles. Females remained in reproductive condition throughout the reproductive season, and the timing of their spawning and molting was synchronized at the population level throughout this period. A semiempirical model predicted that the krill population produced an egg pulse every 20 to 26 d (depending on temperature), and three cohorts were evident in net samples taken later in the year. The likely date on which the first cohort was spawned was around 26 d after the main phytoplankton bloom, suggesting that the bloom triggered egg development in all adult females. Such a synchronized spawning period was observed directly in adult females 26 d after a bloom in March 2000. A total of three cohorts over the 6-month reproductive season is less than the maximum of seven that would be possible if spawning occurred at a periodicity of between 20 and 26 d, suggesting that larval recruitment was not always successful. Analysis showed that successful recruitment was only achieved when chlorophyll a levels were adequate during both the period of egg maturation in the ovary and the subsequent development of larvae, especially the furcilia stages.																	0024-3590					SEP	2003	48	5					2020	2033		10.4319/lo.2003.48.5.2020							WOS:000185433700028

Scattering models	JOURNAL OF THE ACOUSTICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA												Mathematical scattering models are derived and compared with data from zooplankton from several gross anatomical groups-fluidlike, elastic shelled, and gas bearing. The models are based upon the acoustically inferred boundary conditions determined from laboratory backscattering data presented in part I of this series [Stanton er al., J. Acoust. Sec. Am. 103, 225-235 (1998)]. The models use a combination of ray theory, modal-series solution, and distorted wave Born approximation (DWBA). The formulations. which are inherently approximate, are designed to include only the dominant scattering mechanisms as determined from the experiments. The models for the: fluidlike animals (euphausiids in this case)ranged from the simplest case involving two rays, which could qualitatively describe the structure of target strength versus frequency for single pings, to the most complex case involving a rough inhomogeneous asymmetrically tapered bent cylinder using the DWBA-based formulation which could predict echo levels over all angles of incidence (including the difficult region of end-on incidence). The model for the elastic shelled body (gastropods in this case) involved development of an analytical model which takes into account irregularities and discontinuities of the shell. The model for gas-bearing animals (siphonophores) is a hybrid model which is composed of the summation of the exact solution to the gas sphere and the approximate DWBA-based formulation for arbitrarily shaped fluidlike bodies. Then is also a simplified ray-based model for the siphonophore. The models are applied to data involving single pings, ping-to-ping variability, and echoes averaged over many pings. There is reasonable qualitative agreement between the predictions and single ping data, and reasonable quantitative agreement between the predictions and variability and averages of echo data.

Haulout patterns revealed the seals' clear preference for diving during darkness and hauling out onto sea ice during daylight. Seals did not necessarily haul out every day; individual seals hauled out on 80-100% of days during the study period. Four general dive types were identified: 1) traveling dives, 2) foraging dives, 3) crepuscular foraging dives, and 4) exploratory dives. Nearly continual diving occurred for extended periods (about 16 h) nightly, with one individual diving up to 44 h without interruption. Foraging dives occurring during crepuscular periods were deeper than those made during the darkest hours. The authors suggest that the distinct diel pattern of dive timing and depth may be related to possible predator avoidance behavior by the seals' principal prey, Antarctic Krill.																	0722-4060					NOV	1992	12	6-7					635	644									WOS:A1992JY25600009

Datasets were collected in the Atlantic and Indian sectors of the Southern Ocean during four cruises covering spring, mid-summer, autumn and late winter between 1993 and 1998. Carbon recycling by Antarctic meso-and macrozooplankton represented a significant (44-62%) fraction of the primary production, which is at the higher end of previous estimates. Assessment based on detailed community structure appeared to be more realistic than previous estimates and showed that carbon dioxide recycling at the global scale is not a mere function of temperature and abundance of zooplankton. Both species and functional diversity influence current estimates at the community level through trophic type and developmental stage composition. In addition, a regional spatial heterogeneity linked to hydrodynamic features (frontal zones) is also important. The Southern Ocean zooplankton community respiration is assessed to be similar to 0.6 GtC year(-1).																	0142-7873	1464-3774				NOV-DEC	2014	36	6					1543	1556		10.1093/plankt/fbu076							WOS:000345051100014						
J	Taylor, MH; Losch, M; Bracher, A				Taylor, Marc H.; Losch, Martin; Bracher, Astrid			On the drivers of phytoplankton blooms in the Antarctic marginal ice zone: A modeling approach	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS												The pelagic province of the Southern Ocean generally has low levels of primary production attributable to a short growing season in the higher latitudes, a deep mixed layer, and iron limitation. Exceptions include phytoplankton blooms in the marginal ice zone (MIZ) during spring and summer sea-ice retreat. The prevailing hypothesis as to the drivers of the blooms is that sea-ice retreat increases the vertical stability of the water column through the production of melt water and provides shelter from wind mixing in areas of partial sea-ice coverage. These conditions are favorable to phytoplankton growth by allowing them to maintain their position in the upper reaches of the water column. This work investigates the drivers of MIZ blooms using a biochemically coupled global circulation model. Results support the hypothesis in that physical conditions related to a shallow, vertically stable water column (e. g., mixed layer depth and available light) were the most significant predictors of bloom dynamics, while nutrient limitation was of lesser importance. We estimate that MIZ blooms account for 15% of yearly net primary production in the Southern Ocean and that the earlier phases of the MIZ bloom, occurring under partial ice coverage and invisible to remote sensing, account for about two thirds of this production. MIZ blooms were not found to enhance depth-integrated net primary production when compared to similar ecological provinces outside of the MIZ, although the elevated phytoplankton concentrations in surface waters are hypothesized to provide important feeding habitats for grazing organisms such as krill.

Nearest neighbour cluster analysis of phytoplankton and zooplankton data sets indicated the presence of 3 major station groupings within each analysis that collectively had great geographic integrity. Thus a shelf station group was characterised by low phytoplankton biomass and primary production rates (median values 69 mg chl a m(-2); 418 mg C m(-2) d(-1), respectively) and a dominance of nano- and pico-phytoplankton, on the one hand, and low overall mesozooplankton levels (median 50,135 ind. m(-2)), which was also coincident with elevated krill biomass, on the other. At the western end of the island high mesozooplankton abundance (median > 250,000 ind. m(-2)) in oceanic waters was co-incident with a phytoplankton bloom that originated over the North West Georgia Rise (NWGR). These 'bloom' stations were characterised by high phytoplankton biomass and primary production rates (median 218 mg m(-2) and 916 mg C m(-2) d(-1), respectively) and were dominated by microphytoplankton. This elevated production was associated with an anticyclonic eddy which was considered to have been initiated where the Southern Antarctic Circumpolar Current Front (SACCF) interacted with the bathymetry of the NWGR. SeaWiFS and drifter buoy data indicated that this production was subsequently entrained and transported cyclonically around the Georgia Basin downstream from the island. In contrast, at the eastern end of the island, in waters south of the SACCF, phytoplankton biomass and primary production rates were lower (median 40 mg m(-2) and 214 mg C m(-2) d(-1), respectively) although median zooplankton abundance was intermediate (similar to 157,000 ind. m(-2)). Of the environmental variables measured in this study the proportion of microphytoplankton within samples, rather than for example, phytoplankton biomass, explained the greatest proportion of the variance associated with the carbon mass of individual copepod species stages, egg production rates and total zooplankton abundance. We conclude that stations in the western and eastern oceanic regions were dominated by bottom up controls, with physical forcing and adequate nutrient availability leading to bloom conditions of large diatoms in the west, whereas in the east, phytoplankton growth was lower (possibly due to micronutrient limitation) and zooplankton abundance was lower. Over the shelf we suggest that a higher average biomass of krill (similar to 80 g wet mass m(-2)) compared to offshelf (43 g wet mass m(-2)) may have exerted top down control and grazed out chl a and thus have been responsible for low mesozooplankton abundance.

It plays a major trophic role in coastal Antarctic waters as a predator of krill and as prey for penguins and seals. A previous study, using mtDNA to investigate Pleuragramma population structure at multiple Antarctic sites was unable to discriminate between hypotheses of panmixia, with occasional fluctuations of allelic frequencies, and population structure. The aim of the present study was to investigate the population structure of P.antarctica along the Antarctic Peninsula (AP) shelf by microsatellite genotyping. LocationFour areas along the AP shelf: Charcot Island, Marguerite Bay, Joinville Island and the Larsen Ice Shelf. MethodsA total of 562 individuals from nine population samples were genotyped at 16 expressed sequence tag (EST)-linked microsatellites. Genetic variability, Hardy-Weinberg probabilities and F-statistics were calculated, and a hierarchical analysis of molecular variance was carried out. A Bayesian method was applied to estimate the migration rates between geographical localities. ResultsWe found one genetically homogeneous population with no interannual variability in the south-western AP and one off the northern tip of the AP. Significant differences were recorded between the two geographical regions, which also differed from the eastern AP. The extent of differentiation changed between years and significant genetic differentiation was found between clusters of individuals of different length modes collected at Joinville Island in 2010. Bayesian analysis suggested weak gene flow along the western AP, with a prevailing direction from north to south, following the anticlockwise-flowing Coastal Current. Main conclusionsPopulation genetic structure can be detected in AP shelf samples of P.antarctica. Thus, even in this area characterized by strong oceanographic currents, genetic mixing is not complete. Temporal fluctuations of allelic frequencies and genetic differentiation between individuals of different length collected at the same location suggest the importance of genetic drift in this highly abundant species.

We demonstrate here how this relationship can be modified for Southern Ocean higher-order predators when prey accessibility changes as a consequence of the temporally varying sea-ice environment. We examined within- and between-year fluctuations in breeding success, foraging trip duration, meal mass and fledgling weights of Ad,lie penguins (Pygoscelis adeliae) at B,chervaise Island (67A degrees 35'S, 62A degrees 49'E) in east Antarctica to determine the degree of concordance between parameters over a 12-year period and how these varied in relation to sea-ice conditions. The penguins responded to extensive sea-ice (predominantly fast-ice) adjacent to their breeding colony by lengthening their foraging trips, and these years typically had reduced breeding success. Some years indicated good conditions for the penguins across parameters and had relatively high breeding success with heavier fledglings, while others indicated difficult conditions with poorer breeding success and lighter fledglings. In other years, there was discordance in the patterns of breeding success, fledgling mass and early versus late stage foraging trip durations, suggestive of different thresholds for different parameters or within-year changes in resource availability. Our results highlight the importance of accounting for the temporal variability in prey availability as a function of both accessibility and abundance when interpreting predator response curves.																	0025-3162	1432-1793				JUN	2015	162	6					1187	1200		10.1007/s00227-015-2661-5							WOS:000354619600004						
J	ACKLEY, SF; SULLIVAN, CW				ACKLEY, SF; SULLIVAN, CW			PHYSICAL CONTROLS ON THE DEVELOPMENT AND CHARACTERISTICS OF ANTARCTIC SEA-ICE BIOLOGICAL COMMUNITIES - A REVIEW AND SYNTHESIS	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART I-OCEANOGRAPHIC RESEARCH PAPERS												Ice structures found in Antarctic sea ice and related morphological processes are summarized, including: frazil ice growth; the flooded snow layer; pressure ridge induced flooding; thermally driven brine drainage; and platelet-ice formation. The associated colonization, physiological adaptation, and growth of sea ice biota within these structures, to the levels presently identifiable, are also reviewed. A strong interaction exists between the physical processes that form, evolve and deteriorate sea ice, and the biological communities located within sea ice. Variability of ice structure and associated biological communities over small spatial scales necessitated analysis of the biological component in combination with physical and chemical properties of the sea ice. The ice microstructure provides indications of the growth and evolution of the ice properties and initially defines how ice biota colonize the ice. The light, temperature,space and nutrient fields within which ice biota subsequently adapt and grow, are the other key determinants of the biology. While the ice microstructure shapes the localized biological response; relatively large regions of pack ice have characteristic microstructures. Regional patterns of biomass and biological productivity within the Antarctic sea ice zone may therefore be predictable as a result of these physical-biological associations. Examples from the drifting pack ice and fast ice zones of the Weddell and Ross Seas are given.																	0967-0637					OCT	1994	41	10					1583	1604		10.1016/0967-0637(94)90062-0							WOS:A1994QB43800009

The objective of the study was to assess interannual variability in phytoplankton spatial distribution and the mechanisms that regulate phytoplankton accumulation in the water column. Phytoplankton C biomass and Chl a distributions were consistent from year to year, exhibiting a negative on/offshore gradient. The variations in C concentration had a close and non-linear relationship with the upper mixed layer depth, suggesting that the vertical mixing of the water column is the main factor regulating phytoplankton stock. The magnitude of C gradients was 5-fold higher during 1996 than during 1997 and 1999. This was ascribed to interannual variations in the concentration of diatom blooms in the region influenced by sea-ice melting. Vertical distribution of the phytoplankton, as estimated from Chl a profiles, also varied along an on/offshore gradient: Chl a was distributed homogeneously in the upper mixed layer in coastal and mid-shelf stations and concentrated in the deep layer (40-100 m) occupied by the winter waters (WW, remnants of the Antarctic surface waters during summer) in more offshore stations. The region with a deep Chl a maximum layer (DCM layer) was dominated by a phytoplankton assemblage characterized by a relatively high concentration of diatoms. The extent of this region varied from year to year: it was restricted to pelagic waters during 1996, extended to the shelf slope during 1997 and occupied a major portion of the area during 1999. It is hypothesized that iron depletion in near surface waters due to phytoplankton consumption, and a higher concentration in WW, regulated this vertical phytoplankton distribution pattern. Furthermore, we postulate that year-to-year variations in the spatial distribution of the DCM layer were related to interannual variations in the timing of the sea-ice retreat. The similarity between our results and those reported in literature for other areas of the Southern Ocean allows us to suggest that the mechanisms proposed here as regulating phytoplankton stock in our area may be applicable elsewhere.																	0142-7873	1464-3774				AUG	2005	27	8					825	843		10.1093/plankt/fbi056							WOS:000232593000010

Surveys were timed to coincide with the seasonal aggregation of whale sharks, Rhincodon typus, and other large zooplanktivores in these waters. The surveys examined scattering features of lagoon/shelf fronts, a series of cross-shelf transects and waters surrounding whale sharks swimming at the surface. These suggested that lagoon waters flow intrusively into shelf waters at reef passages in a layered exchange. Cross-shelf transects identified three vertical scattering layers: a surface bubble layer; a near-surface minimum layer; and a bottom maximum layer. Regions of intense mixing of lagoon and shelf waters were detected seaward and to the north of reef passages. Integrated acoustic mean volume backscatter of the bottom maximum layer increased with depth and distance offshore. Large subsurface aggregations of unidentified fauna were detected beneath whale sharks in the same area that manta rays and surface schools of euphausiids were also observed.

Five experimental diets consisted of different proportions of FM (0, 25, 50, 75, and 100 g/kg) were substituted with KM, corresponding to dietary inclusion levels of 0 (KM0), 28.8 g/kg (KM29), 57.6 g/kg (KM58), 86.4 g/kg (KM86), and 115.2 g/kg (KM115). The results showed that: (1) the weight gain rate (WGR) of the fish in the KM58, KM86, and KM115 groups were significantly higher than those of the KM0 group, whereas the opposite result was observed for the feed conversion ratio. (2) Serum complement 3 content and superoxide dismutase activity in the KM58 group and alkaline phosphatase activity in the KM29, KM58, and KM115 groups were significantly higher than those in the KM0 group. However, there were no significant differences in serum immunoglobulin M, complement 4, malondialdehyde content, and catalase activity among all groups. (3) The highest levels of hardness, cohesiveness, springiness, chewiness, gumminess, and adhesiveness of muscle tissues of M. albus fed with the KM58 diet were significantly higher than those of the other treatments. (4) No remarkable difference was detected in MEF2A, MEF2D, MyoG, and Myf5 mRNA expression levels in the muscle tissues among the dietary treatments.

Biology and life cycles of pelagic tunicates in the Lazarev Sea, Southern Ocean	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY												Four grid surveys were carried out in the top 200 m layer of the Lazarev Sea during fall 2004, summer 2005-06, winter 2006 and summer 2007-08 onboard the R.V. Polarstern as a part of the German SO-GLOBEC. The distribution, abundance and biology of two species of salps, Salpa thompsoni and Ihlea racovitzai, were investigated. With the exception of fall 2004, I. racovitzai dominated the salp community although being represented by low densities (<20 ind. 1000 m(-3)). S. thompsoni was scarce during the summers of 2005-06 and 2007-08 and almost absent from the region during winter 2006. Nevertheless, it was modestly numerous during fall 2004 reaching densities of up to 33 ind. 1000 m(-3) in the southwestern stations of the grid. The data on the seasonal population structure and life cycle off. racovitzai showed that this species followed the generalized pattern typical of S. thompsoni, i.e. sexual/asexual reproduction and spawning during fall. I. racovitzai densities were the lowest during summer, increased during fall and peaked in during winter. Numerous offspring were produced by I. racovitzai during fall, just before the area became ice-covered. Conversely, S. thompsoni was not able to complete its life cycle in the Lazarev Sea, with a high occurrence of stage X (unfertilized) aggregates present. Highest S. thompsoni densities in summer and fall, and its disappearance in winter are indicative of a population of the expatriate origin that is sustained by advection.

J	David, V; Sautour, B; Galois, R; Chardy, P				David, Valerie; Sautour, Benoit; Galois, Robert; Chardy, Pierre			The paradox high zooplankton biomass-low vegetal particulate organic matter in high turbidity zones: What way for energy transfer?	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY												Estuarine ecosystems are characterized by high zooplanktonic biomasses, essentially constituted by copepods and mysids whose nutritional requirements are mainly provided by phytoplankton, an easily available carbon form. The Gironde estuary is characterized by high turbidities which limit light penetration in the water column and therefore primary production. Consequently, primary production is low and its availability for higher trophic level is very limited. The main goal of this study was to characterize the total vegetal particulate organic matter (POM) in high turbidity zones of the Gironde estuary during summer (a critical period characterized by high heterotrophic bacterial degradation and high zooplanktonic biomasses) and to analyse its utilization by zooplankton, using prey/predator experiments and trophic biomarkers (fatty acids). The specific goals were to define (i) how vegetal POM was exploited by the different zooplanktonic groups (protozoa, copepods and mysids) and (ii) which alternative preys could be used when vegetal POM was not sufficient to ensure their nutritional requirements. Chlorophyll biomass was very low in the MTZ during summer 2002 (0.48 +/- 0.03 mg m(-3)). Total zooplankton grazing was low (19% d(-1)) probably due to a large contribution of detritus originating from terrestrial plants in vegetal POM compared to phytoplankton. The highest grazing pressure was exercised by the mysid Mesopodopsis slabberi due to its high abundances and by its almost entirely herbivorous diet (phytoplankton and small terrestrial detritus). Grazing rates (19.7 +/- 4.2 and 9.6 mu gC cop(-1) d(-1) for juveniles and adults, respectively) seemed to be sufficient to satisfy their daily carbon requirement. Grazing rate of the copepod Eurytemora affinis (139 ngC cop(-1) d(-1)) seemed to be insufficient to cover its nutritional requirements and the copepods probably needed to complete a great part of their diet from protozoa. Grazing rates of the mysid Neomysis integer (24.7 +/- 0.01 and 20.89 +/- 8.45 mu gC cop(-1) d(-1) for juveniles and adults, respectively) were higher than those of M. slabberi when feeding only on phytoplankton. However, when other preys were introduced in its environment, N. integer only fed on the copepod E. affinis with a preference for nauplii. The study revealed the great importance of protozoa and bacteria in the trophic transfers between vegetal POM and zooplankton in the MTZ during summer, despite the low protozoa grazing pressure on vegetal POM (3.1 %). The detritic food chain probably implies various trophic transfers with little direct relationships between vegetal POM and zooplankton. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Texture and color properties of gels made from silver carp protein recovered at different pH strategies and organic acid types were compared. ISP was applied to headed gutted silver carp using 10 mol L-1 sodium hydroxide (NaOH) and either glacial acetic acid (AA) or a (1:1) formic and lactic acid combination (F&L). Protein gels were made with recovered protein and standard functional additives. RESULTSTexture profile analysis and the Kramer shear test showed that protein gels made from protein solubilized at basic pH values were firmer, harder, more cohesive, gummier and chewier (P < 0.05) than proteins solubilized under acidic conditions. Acidic solubilization led to whiter (P < 0.05) gels, and using F&L during ISP yielded whiter gels under all treatments (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONGels made from ISP-recovered silver carp protein using organic acids show potential for use as a functional ingredient in restructured foods.

J	Burrows, MT; Tarling, G				Burrows, MT; Tarling, G			Effects of density dependence on diel vertical migration of populations of northern krill: a Genetic Algorithm model	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												Net and acoustic studies of diel vertical migration (DVM) in krill often show a degree of dispersion around the mean population depth, which becomes greater during night-time. Trade-off models can predict optimum depths over diet cycles but rarely explain why there is vertical scatter and why aggregations disperse at certain times. We examined density-dependent factors as a potential explanation for these phenomena. A Genetic Algorithm model was developed that predicted DVM,in a krill population based on internal state (i.e. levels of energy reserves), risk of predation and location of conspecifics. The modelling approach was designed to be dynamic in that optimal policies could respond to changing circumstances through time. Parameterisation of the model was achieved through measurements made in the Clyde Sea Area on northern krill Meganyctiphanes norvegica and its environment. Light intensity at depth was used to assess the level of risk of visual predation. Food provision was a mixture of vertically stratified phytoplankton and vertically migrating copepods. A negative exponential function was used to simulate density dependence in the food returns at each depth. Sensitivity analyses involved alterations to the level of density dependence and the metabolic rate. DVM was predicted in all sensitivity analyses and each correlated positively with net catch and acoustic observations. Increased density dependence in feeding success did not affect the mean depths chosen at night but did increase the spread of the population. The closest fit to observations was achieved when the metabolic rate was lowered and risk of mortality rate was assessed over a yearly rather than daily period. The model predicted that the population should spread more under low food conditions. We recommend that density-dependent factors be included in future state-dependent models predicting krill behaviour and life-cycle patterns.

Differences in foraging behaviour were most pronounced during the guard stage of chick rearing. Female penguins made on average longer foraging trips than males, ranged greater distances more frequently and consumed larger quantities of krill. In contrast, males made shorter journeys to closer foraging grounds during the guard period and fed more-extensively on fish throughout chick rearing. Mean guard stage foraging trip durations over four seasons at Bechervaise Island, Eastern Antarctica and over two seasons at Edmonson Point, Ross Sea ranged between 31 and 73 h for females and 25 and 36 h for males. Ninety-percent of males tracked from Bechervaise Island by satellite during the first 3 weeks post-hatch foraged within 20 km of the colony, while the majority(60%) of females travelled to the edge of the continental shelf (80-120 km from the colony)to feed during this period.

J	REID, K				REID, K			THE DIET OF ANTARCTIC FUR SEALS (ARCTOCEPHALUS-GAZELLA PETERS 1875) DURING WINTER AT SOUTH GEORGIA	ANTARCTIC SCIENCE												The diet of mainly adult and sub-adult male Antarctic fur seals (Arctocephalus gazella) was investigated during the austral winters of 1992 and 1993 using faecal (seat) analysis. Of samples containing identifiable prey remains (n=376), c. 28% contained krill alone, c. 37% contained fish alone and c. 35% contained both krill and fish. The mean size of krill taken was smaller than in summer due to the absence of large adult krill of 55-60 mm total length. Of the 25 fish taxa taken, krill-feeding species predominated, especially in seats that also contained krill. Non-krill feeding species were more abundant in seats containing fish alone. The mackerel icefish (Champsocephalus gunnari Lonnberg 1905), which feeds mainly on krill, was the most important fish species in terms of absolute frequency (53%), frequency of occurrence (69%) and estimated biomass (47%); fur seals may have a significant impact on local stocks of this species. Cephalopods and pelagic fish (myctophids) were of minor importance in the diet (<2%). The importance of krill and krill-feeding fish species suggests that the male fur seals, which are present around South Georgia in winter, are targeting their foraging on a krill and fish community, probably associated with krill aggregations.																	0954-1020					SEP	1995	7	3					241	249		10.1017/S0954102095000344							WOS:A1995RT41400005

Nineteen enzyme loci were examined for 7 population samples of P. elegans, and the proportion of polymorphic loci (P0.95) and average frequency of heterozygotes per locus (H) were calculated as 0.11 and 0.026, respectively. Fifteen enzyme loci were examined for 2 populations of E. hamata, and P0.95 and H were calculated as 0. 10 and 0.038, respectively. On the basis of allele frequencies at 2 enzyme loci it is possible to suggest that P. elegans population samples collected in the Sea of Japan were reproductively isolated from those in the Oyashio. Moreover it would appear that 4 population samples of P. elegans in the Sea of Japan are representative of a panmictic population. Differences in allele frequencies between population samples of the Oyashio suggest that these populations are genetically structured. It appears that genetic structuring exists in the 2 population samples investigated for E. hamata also. P. elegans and E. hamata expressed no common alleles over all the loci assayed indicating that the 2 species are phylogenetically very distant within the phylum Chaetognatha.

Time series analysis of biologging data: autocorrelation reveals periodicity of diving behaviour in macaroni penguins	ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR												The nature of how behaviour at one time step influences the next is of great interest to behavioural ecologists, but rarely used for comparisons between animals. Time depth recorders (TDR) and other archival tags have been widely used to infer patterns of diving and foraging. However, while we can extract variables that describe individual dives, how runs of dives may indicate behaviours and how one dive influences the next are not fully understood. Treating TDR data as time series, we examined patterns of autocorrelation to investigate structure in the timing of behaviour. We fitted an oscillating best-fit curve to the autocorrelation and used the parameters of this curve to investigate differences in foraging strategy of 129 macaroni penguins, Eudyptes chrysolophus, of both sexes. We found interannual differences in autocorrelation parameters as well as differences between reproductive stages. In contrast to other studies of macaroni penguin diving based on depth analysis, we found no differences between the sexes. We mimicked changes in the various parameters by simulation of dive profiles, and used these to infer biological meaning from the parameters. As this technique makes very few assumptions about how to identify a dive or cluster of dives, we suggest that it is a useful first characterization of diving or cyclical behaviour in a wide range of animals.

J	Kawall, HG; Torres, JJ; Geiger, SP				Kawall, HG; Torres, JJ; Geiger, SP			Effects of the ice-edge bloom and season on the metabolism of copepods in the Weddell Sea, Antarctica	HYDROBIOLOGIA												The metabolic responses of several species of Antarctic copepods to primary productivity and changes between seasons were investigated. To examine the influence of the spring ice-edge bloom on the metabolism of copepods, oxygen consumption rates were determined on specimens from three zones of widely different ice coverage and chlorophyll biomass: pack ice (pre-bloom), ice edge (bloom) and open water (post-bloom). Summer metabolic rates were compared with published winter rates. Field work was done in the Weddell Sea in the region of 60 degreesS, 36 degreesW in late November and December 1993. Oxygen consumption rates were determined by placing individuals in syringe respirometers and monitoring the oxygen partial pressure for 10-20 hours. Higher metabolic rates were observed in the primarily herbivorous copepods, Calanoides acutus, Rhincalanus gigas and Calanus propinquus in regions of higher primary production: ice edge and open water. The carnivorous Paraeuchaeta antarctica showed a similar pattern. The omnivorous copepods Metridia gerlachei and Gaetanus tenuispinus showed no changes in metabolism between zones. Data on routine rates of copepods from the winter were available for C. propinquus and P. antarctica. In P. antarctica, rates were higher in the summer. Calanus propinquus showed a higher metabolic rate in the summer than in the winter, but the difference was not significant at the 0.05 level. It was concluded that copepods near the ice zone in the ice zone in the Antarctic rely on the spring ice-edge bloom for growth and completion of their life cycle.																	0018-8158						2001	453	1-3					67	77		10.1023/A:1013155614953							WOS:000172600200006

However, color of restructured products made of proteins recovered from chicken processing by-products is poor. The by-products contain bones, skin, fat, etc. that affect color of restructured products. Therefore, color properties need to be improved. The objectives of this study were to determine effects of isoelectric solubilization/precipitation (ISP) and TiO2 on instrumental color and texture properties of heat-set gels made of proteins recovered from dark chicken-meat processing by-products as compared to gels made of chicken breast meat. Skin-on bone-in chicken drumsticks were used as a model dark chicken-meat processing by-products. TiO2 at 0 -1 g/100 g and canola oil at 10 g/100 g were added to the ISP-recovered proteins followed by cooking. Due to higher (P < 0.05) yellowness (b*) and lower (P < 0.05) lightness (L*), the whiteness of drumstick gels without TiO2 was lower (P < 0.05) than breast gels. TiO2 at 1 g/100 g with canola oil resulted in slightly better (P < 0.05) whiteness of drumstick gels than breast gels. TiO2 did not deteriorate gel texture, which was generally comparable to breast gels. This research indicates that ISP allows recovery of proteins from skin-on bone-in dark chicken-meat processing by-products without removal of bones, skin, and fat prior to processing. Addition of TiO2 to proteins recovered from these by-products allows development of heat-set gels with color and texture comparable to chicken breast gels. Although this study shows the potential for a novel, marketable food product, sensory tests are recommended. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Environmental drivers of humpback whale foraging behavior in the remote Southern Ocean	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY												Satellite telemetry and animal movement models advance our ability to remotely monitor the behavior of wideranging species. Understanding how different behaviors (e.g. foraging) are shaped by dynamic environmental features is fundamental to understanding ecological interactions and the impact of variability. In this study we deployed satellite-linked tags on humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) and used state-space models to estimate locations and to infer underlying behavioral states. We then modelled the association between whale behavior (e.g. foraging or transiting) and environmental variables using linear mixed-effect models, We identified the importance of two recently discovered Southern Ocean feeding areas for Oceania humpback whales as well as the key environmental drivers affecting whale behavior. We detected behavioral differences between whales utilizing the two adjacent feeding regions (similar to 2000 km apart), which were likely caused by animals trying to efficiently locate prey in relation to the dynamic environmental characteristics of each habitat. We observed a seasonal pattern in foraging behavior, with the peak occurring in the middle of summer. Whales also foraged more intensively with increasing proximity to areas from which the ice edge had recently retreated, suggesting heightened productivity in these areas. The relationship between the animals and the physical features of the seascape, as well as the behavioral plasticity observed, could have implications for the future recovery of these whales in a changing Southern Ocean.

However, effects of jellyfish outbreaks in the ecosystems remain poorly understood and little or no information is available on their dietary preferences - in relation to the seasonal shifts of prey abundance - and on the potential variability of their impact on marine food webs. The mauve stinger Pelagia noctiluca (Forsskal, 1775) is by far the most common outbreak-forming scyphozoan jellyfish in the Western Mediterranean. By use of a combination of stomach contents, stable isotope (SI) and fatty acid (FA) analyses, we tested the hypothesis that changes in the seasonal dietary sources of P. noctiluca parallel changes in the FA and SI composition. Stomach content and biomarker analyses suggested that P. noctiluca is not a selective predator, cyclically shifting between carnivory and omnivory depending on the seasonality of accessible prey. The combination of SI and FA analyses highlighted the importance of microzooplankton as prey. Specific FA biomarkers showed that the diet of P. noctiluca changed seasonally depending on the availability of living plankton or suspended detritus. This study also revealed significant biochemical differences between jellyfish somatic and gonadal tissues, with total fatty acid concentration in the gonads up to ten times higher than in the somatic tissues.

We observed a high biomass of zooplankton between 53.8degrees and 53.4degreesS associated with the inshore, northwestward flow of the Southern Antarctic Circumpolar Current Front (SACCF) that occurred in around 2500 m of water close to the base of the slope. There was very little zooplankton biomass present in the more offshore, eastward flowing waters where a second manifestation of the SACCF was also present on the section. The region of enhanced zooplankton biomass was over 50 km in horizontal extent with the highest densities (>10 g m(-3)) in the area of strongest flow (>35 cm s(-1)). The majority of the zooplankton present on the section was Antarctic krill and most of it occurred in the upper 100 m. The rate of physically mediated transport of Antarctic krill across the off-shelf sections (similar to10 km) of the transect showed marked variation, with highest rates (>10(6) g s(-1)) associated with the northwestward flow of the SACCF. Farther offshore, where the krill biomass and flow rates were much reduced, the flux of krill was very low. The integrated horizontal flux of krill across the offshore sections was large (192 x 10(3) t d(-1)) and to the northwest. A second occupation of the transect showed that the krill flux is highly variable, and we discuss the various physical and biological factors that will generate such variability. We show that horizontal flux of krill in ocean currents is a major factor in determining the abundance of krill around South Georgia.

J	Miller, TW; Hankin, DG				Miller, TW; Hankin, DG			Descriptions and durations of premolt setal stages in female Dungeness crabs, Cancer magister	MARINE BIOLOGY												For crustaceans with a well-defined annual molting season, such as adult female Dungeness crabs (Cancer magister Dana), setal molt staging can, in principle, be used to predict molting destiny of individual crabs. Size-specific predictions of molting probability could, in turn, be useful for estimating mortalities due to molting. Female Dungeness crabs were collected January-March 1997 at depths of 10-30 m off the California coast, USA (41degreesN). Intermolt stage A(1)-C-4 and premolt stages D-0, D-1', D-1", D-1''' and greater than or equal toD(2) were described based on features of the branchial epipod. Laboratory experiments suggested that stage D-1' was the earliest stage beyond which eventual molting was inevitable so that molting destiny could be determined. Estimated mean number of days from the beginning of stage D-1' to molting was 85. Estimated individual stage durations, based on laboratory experiments, were 24, 51, -4, 18, and 20 days, respectively, for stages D-0, D-1', D-1", D-1''', and greater than or equal toD(2). The estimated -4 days for stage D-1"' suggests that this stage must be very brief and raises a question of its utility in designation of molt stages. Molt staging of three field samples, 300-600 crabs in each, collected prior to the 1997 annual molting season, indicated an increase in the size and frequency of crabs staged D-1' or later as the time to molt approached, although crabs of 150 mm carapace width and larger showed few signs of molt preparation. Because the duration of the molting season (approximately 120 days) for adult female C. magister in northern California exceeds the estimated maximum duration of reliable prediction of molting destiny (85 days), it does not appear that molt staging can be used to predict molting destiny in this population. However, the procedures that we have used in this paper for application to female C. magister might be used with success for other crustaceans if the duration of stages D-1' to molting exceeds the duration of the molting season, and furthermore may be used for describing temporal molting trends.																	0025-3162					JAN	2004	144	1					101	110		10.1007/s00227-003-1180-y							WOS:000187504900012

The 18S profiles of diet and pellets from both species do not match the planktonic profile, suggesting that both are selective grazers with a similar diet. Over the past decades, two key grazers in the Southern Ocean (SO), krill and salps, have experienced drastic changes in their distribution and abundance, leading to increasing overlap of their habitats. Both species occupy different ecological niches and long-term shifts in their distributions are expected to have cascading effects on the SO ecosystem. However, studies directly comparing krill and salps are lacking. Here, we provide a direct comparison of the diet and fecal pellet composition of krill and salps using 18S metabarcoding and fatty acid markers. Neither species' diet reflected the composition of the plankton community, suggesting that in contrast to the accepted paradigm, not only krill but also salps are selective feeders. Moreover, we found that krill and salps had broadly similar diets, potentially enhancing the competition between both species. This could be augmented by salps' ability to rapidly reproduce in favorable conditions, posing further risks to krill populations.

J	Van Opzeeland, I; Hillebrand, H				Van Opzeeland, I; Hillebrand, H.			Year-round passive acoustic data reveal spatio-temporal patterns in marine mammal community composition in the Weddell Sea, Antarctica	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												To date, the majority of studies investigating marine mammal distribution and behavior take a single-species perspective, which is often driven by the logistic difficulties of collecting appropriate data at sea. Passive acoustic monitoring, provided recording tools exhibit sufficient bandwidth, has the potential to provide insights into community structure as devices operate autonomously simultaneously collecting data on baleen, pinniped and toothed whale acoustic presence. Data can provide information on local species diversity, residency times and co-occurrence. Here, we used multi-year passive acoustic data from 6 sites in the Weddell Sea, Southern Ocean, to explore how local marine mammal community compositions develop over time and in relation to sea-ice. Diversity peaked in austral late spring and early summer, shortly before seasonal sea-ice break-up. The effective number of species exhibited little variation over time, reflecting that species remain in Antarctic waters throughout austral winter. Community composition showed almost complete seasonal overturn, indicating that species replace each other throughout the year. For all 6 sites, community dissimilarity increased with increasing temporal distance, reflecting temporal trends in community composition beyond seasonality. Several species exhibited significant positive or negative co-occurrence patterns over time. These seasonal associations were consistent across all 5 oceanic sites, but partly inversed at the Western Antarctic Peninsula recording site. This study shows that the application of biodiversity metrics to passive acoustic monitoring data can foster insights into the timing of behaviors and community composition, which can boost the interpretation of responses in the light of ongoing environmental changes.																	0171-8630	1616-1599				MAR 19	2020	638						191	206		10.3354/meps13258							WOS:000521740400015

Structure, abundance and biomass size spectra of copepods and other zooplankton communities in upper waters of the Southwestern Atlantic Ocean during summer	JOURNAL OF PLANKTON RESEARCH												Little attention has been paid to small copepods and other zooplankton inhabiting pelagic ecosystems of the Southwestern Atlantic Ocean under the influence of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current circulation, despite their important role in the trophic chain and fisheries. This study gives a synoptic view (January 2001) of the micro and mesoplankton size fractions and normalized biomass size spectra (NBSS) in upper waters of five different ecological domains (shelf and oceanic Subantarctic and Antarctic waters) including the BrazilMalvinas confluence (BMC). Copepods were always the main component of the zooplankton; the 300-m fraction represented between 70 and 99 in terms of numbers and from 20 to 88 in terms of biomass. Other zooplankton contributed with 40 to total zooplankton densities, though showing some biomass peaks (50). Chlorophyll a, sea surface temperature and salinity were the environmental variables that best explained the distribution trend of zooplankton, mainly that of the 300-m fraction. For all the domains, NBSS revealed flat slopes (0.6 to 1), suggesting a higher proportion of large organisms than expected at equilibrium. A dome-shape feature was detected in the BMC. Total biomass and trophic levels of the system were related to the composition of the community and the hydrological conditions of the domains covered.																	0142-7873	1464-3774				MAY-JUN	2013	35	3					610	629		10.1093/plankt/fbt014							WOS:000318573100012

This requires that biophysical processes in aquatic systems be comprehensively explored and new methods for monitoring their dynamics be developed. While aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems have much in common in terms of their mathematical description, there are essential differences between them. For example, the mobility of oceanic plankton is mainly controlled by diffusion processes, whereas terrestrial organisms naturally enough obey totally different laws. This paper is focused on the processes underlying the dynamics of spatially inhomogeneous plankton communities. We demonstrate that conceptual reaction-diffusion mathematical models are an appropriate tool for investigating both complex spatio-temporal plankton dynamics and the fractal properties of planktivorous fish school walks.

J	Johnston, DJ; Yellowlees, D				Johnston, DJ; Yellowlees, D			Relationship between dietary preferences and digestive enzyme complement of the slipper lobster Thenus orientalis (Decapoda : Scyllaridae)	JOURNAL OF CRUSTACEAN BIOLOGY												Digestive capabilities of the commercially important slipper lobster Thenus orientalis were determined by comparing the range and concentration of digestive enzymes produced with the preferred diet of this and other slipper lobster species. Thenus orientalis is a specialized predator of bivalve molluscs, which are located by probing and digging the substratum. The edible flesh is removed by wedging, a progressive prying the shell valves apart, using the Sharp keratinized pereiopod dactyls. The range and concentration of digestive enzymes produced reflects the carnivorous diet of T. orientalis. The proteases trypsin and chymotrypsin are produced in high concentrations, the former representing a considerable proportion (up to 13%) of digestive gland protein. Detection of alpha-amylase and alpha-glucosidase indicates that T. orientalis is capable of hydrolyzing glycogen, the major storage polysaccharide in bivalve adductor muscle. These features indicate a digestive capability specialized for the hydrolysis of flesh. Significant N-acetyl beta-D-glucosaminidase activity revealed an ability by T. orientalis to hydrolyze chito-oligosaccharides and suggested that it can digest chitin from crustacean exoskeletons that have been found in the diet of other scyllarids. Digestive fluid pH (5.9) is consistent with the acid pH optima of carbohydrases, verifying that they are well adapted for extracellular digestion.

J	GARRISON, DL				GARRISON, DL			ANTARCTIC SEA ICE BIOTA	AMERICAN ZOOLOGIST												The sea ice surrounding Antarctica provides an extensive habitat for organisms ranging in size from bacteria to marine birds and mammals. Historically, most of the ecological work on the ice biota has focused in the nearshore land-fast ice. Only in the last decade have there been comparable studies in the deep-water pack ice regions. These studies have indicated that there are fundamental differences in structural and physical characteristics of fast and pack ice that are a result of differing physical regimes in near-shore and oceanic regions. Other physical processes act to create heterogeneity within the ice habitat that can range from geographic and regional scales of patchiness to a pronounced vertical gradient within ice floes. The conspicuous patterns in the distribution of the ice biota can be explained largely by these physical processes. Over 200 species have been reported living on, in, or in association with Antarctic sea ice. The ice biota includes bacteria, a variety of algae, heterotrophic protozoans and small metazoans. The diatom assemblages are the only taxonomic group that is known well enough to make comparisons among the various habitats. Studies by a number of workers suggest some specific diatom assemblages along with occurrence of species that are widely-distributed in both ice and plankton. Ice may also serve as a temporary habitat for species that also comprise planktonic communities, so that providing a "seed population" for ice edge plankton blooms may be an important role of the ice biota. Trophic interactions among organisms in ice suggest that the ice assemblage is a true community with a well-developed microbial food web. The ice microbial community may be an important part of the Antarctic marine food web because large consumers from the adjacent planktonic and benthic communities appear to feed on the ice biota.																	0003-1569						1991	31	1					17	33									WOS:A1991FD12300003

Because the species frequents the edges of ice packs in summer, the potential impact of long-term physical environmental changes poses serious conservation concerns. Condition along the ice edge vary regionally, sometimes forming small ice free areas (ice gaps), and little is known about whale movement patterns associated with these small-scale variations in the physical environment. In this study, six minke whales were tracked for an average of 31 days (range 4-77 days) from January to March of 2016 and 2017 between 60 degrees E and 140 degrees E above and off the continental shelf. The tracking data of five animals were fitted to a Bayesian hierarchical switching state-space model assembled from ARGOS data filters to estimate behavioral states. Results show that Antarctic minke whales are likely to search for ice gaps areas and remain there for extended periods until the surrounding ice melts, rather than stay at krill rich shelf breaks or areas with high chlorophyll-a concentration. When no ice gaps were nearby, the whales were likely to move eastward along highly concentrated ice packs to find a gap. Our study found a strong association between minke whale movements and ice dynamics during the summer foraging season in this region.

Post-breeding dispersal of Adelie penguins (Pygoscelis adeliae) nesting at Signy Island, South Orkney Islands	POLAR BIOLOGY												ARGOS satellite telemetry and Global Location Sensors (geolocators) were used to identify the moult locations and the winter foraging dispersal of Adelie penguins after they left their breeding colonies on Signy Island in the South Orkney Islands. Animals were tracked during the period December 2004 to October 2005. All birds displayed a similar pattern of migratory behaviour, remaining away from colonies for approximately 9 months, at distances of up to 2,235 km. Moult locations were within the pack ice. Mean daily travel speeds to the moult locations were significantly faster when moving through open water than through pack ice. Moult occurred during February/March within a narrow latitudinal range (65-71 degrees S), at a mean distance of 126 km from the ice edge; the mean duration of individual moult was c. 18.6 days. After moult, penguins spent the subsequent winter months moving north or north-eastward within the expanding winter pack ice, at a mean distance of 216 km from the ice edge, and in areas with ice cover > 80%. The penguins returned to the vicinity of their colony between September 26 and October 22, 2005. This dependence of Adelie penguins on sea ice habitat suggests that any further reductions in sea ice extent in the Weddell Sea region would potentially have important impacts on the population processes of this pagophilic species.

In the deeper outer portion of the Bank where the water is stratified, volume backscattering was layered and internal waves modulated the vertical position of the layers in the pycnocline, The internal saves typically had amplitudes of 5-20 m, but sometimes much higher, Species composition and size data from samples of the animals and suspended sediment used in conjunction with acoustic scattering models revealed that throughout the region the animals generally dominate the scattering, but there are times and places where sand particles (suspended as high as up to the sea surface) can dominate. The source of the scattering in the internal waves is probably due to a combination of both animals and sound-speed microstructure. Determination of their relative contributions requires further study.

A total of 1700 km(2) of ocean habitat was surveyed over six cruises. We considered the distribution of the most abundant marine birds and mammals in relation to bathymetry. We focused our analyses on eight focal taxa: Cassin's auklet (Ptychoramphus aleuticus), common murre (Uria aalge), sooty shearwater (Puffinus grieus), phalarope species (red, and red-necked: Phalaropus fulicaria, Phalaropus lobatus), Dall's porpoise (Phocoenoides dalli), Pacific white-sided dolphin (Lagenorhynchus obliquidens), humpback whale (Megaptera novaeangliae), and Risso's dolphin (Grampus griseus). We evaluated associations of top predators with seven bathymetric indices and three distance measurements to shallow-water topographies. The bathymetric descriptors included (1) median depth, (2) depth coefficient of variation, (3) contour index, and shortest distance to (4) the mainland, (5) the continental shelf-break (200-m isobath), (6) the continental slope (1000-m isobath), and (7) pelagic waters (3000-m isobath). The measurements of shallow water topographies included the shortest distance to: (8) the Cordell Bank seamount, (9) the Farallon Island Archipelago (a breeding colony for auklets and murres), and (10) Monterey Canyon. We documented two instances of spatial autocorrelation (for Cassin's anklet and common murre) at lags (distances) of 0-3 and 3-9 km, respectively, and accounted for this spatial pattern in analyses of habitat associations. We found similar relationships between cetaceans and bathymetric features at both interannual and weekly time scales. Seabirds revealed both pesistent and variable relationships through time. For the resident breeding murres, we detected an interannual trend in habitat use, with these birds shifting their distribution offshore over time. Our study demonstrates that resident and migrant marine birds and cetaceans are associated with bathymetric features and shallow-water topographies, though responses varied across species and time. In spite of this variability, we contend that bathymetric associations of upper trophic-level predators can help delineate sites of elevated trophic transfer. An understanding of marine productivity and predator aggregation patterns is essential to design ecosystem-level conservation plans for protecting marine habitats and species. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Six fledglings departed from Bechervaise Island near Mawson station (67degrees 35' S, 62degrees 49' E) during late February of 1996 and 1997 and were tracked for up to 5 mo before transmissions stopped. The 7th fledgling left Magnetic Island near Davis station (68degrees 33' S, 77degrees 54' E) in February 1995 and was tracked for 32 d. All fledglings travelled northward initially, then westward along the edge of the fast ice or in the pack-ice, Fledglings had travelled between 536 and 1931 km to the west of their natal colonies by the time transmissions ceased. Adult Adelie penguins were tracked between March and October 1998, following completion of their annual moult at Bechervaise Island. Instruments were set to transmit for 2 h every 10th day over the first 5 mo and 1 d in 4 thereafter. Adult birds travelled westward until July, after which time they moved north within the expanding pack-ice into known areas of high krill concentration before returning eastward toward their breeding sites. Penguin movements over the winter months were closely related to those of sea ice in the region. Ice motion patterns were in turn influenced by gyral oceanic current systems and wind. We propose that large gyral oceanic systems provide a means, for Adelie penguins to reduce costs of transport as they travel into regions of high productivity during winter and return to their breeding colonies in spring.																	0171-8630						2003	248						267	278		10.3354/meps248267							WOS:000181769500021

Krill were observed in May-June 2013 and December 2014 in 3 bays in the Western Antarctic Peninsula. Krill abundances and movement behaviors were determined from in situ image sequences collected for up to 10 min throughout the water column, up to 625 m deep; 3,345 individual krill tracks were collected. Seasonal changes in individual krill behaviors coincided with seasonal shifts in krill vertical distributions. During late spring, net upward swimming direction (0.9 +/- 2.1 degrees from horizontal) and vertical velocity (0.3 +/- 0.2 body lengths [BL] s(-1)) resulted in shallower maximum abundances of krill within the water column proximate to near-surface phytoplankton distributions. During late autumn, krill swimming patterns tended downward, including swimming direction (-5.2 +/- 0.8 degrees from horizontal) and vertical velocity (-0.1 +/- 0.0 BL s(-1)), leading to deeper distributions proximate to the benthos. Individual krill motility was greater in spring than autumn, as evidenced by an increase in swimming speeds (5.4 +/- 0.2 vs. 2.8 +/- 0.0 BL s(-1)) and turning rates (120 +/- 5 vs. 107 +/- 2 degrees s(-1)). Remarkably, krill in autumn were capable of swimming as quickly as krill in spring. These results suggest seasonal shifts in krill movement behaviors have direct ramifications for krill distributions, proximity to food sources, and impacts on biogeochemical cycling in coastal Antarctic waters.

Vertical fatty acid composition in the blubber of leopard seals and the implications for dietary analysis	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY												The analysis of blubber fatty acids (FAs) is a useful tool to infer diet of mammals that live in remote regions where year-round studies are difficult. The FA may not be distributed uniformly within the blubber, which can have implications for dietary predictive studies. The aim of this study was to determine the FA composition in the blubber core of the Antarctic leopard seal, Hydrurga leptonyx, and evaluate the potential implications of FA stratification for dietary analysis. The blubber cores of 24 seals were sub-sectioned into outer, middle and inner layers and their FA were compared to those of their potential prey species. A vertical variation in FA composition was found across the whole blubber core of the leopard seal. 17 FAs were found at greater than trace amounts (>0.5%) across all samples and the most abundant were: C18:1 omega 9, C16:1, C22:6 omega 3, C16:0 and C18:1 omega 7, which accounted for approximately 70% of the total FA. Almost all FAs had a continuous gradient through the blubber. Principal Component Analysis confirmed separation between inner and outer layers while the middle layer was a transition. The stratification of the leopard seal blubber was similar to the general pattern observed in a variety of marine species: monounsaturated FA (MUFA) dominated the three layers being more abundant in the outer layer, polyunsaturated (PUFA) and saturated FA (SFA) were more abundant in the inner layer. Polyunsaturated FAs are of dietary origin and SFAS are chemically inert so they can be used as a long-term reserve, which suggest that the inner layer is the site of deposition of the FA obtained from diet. The influence of prey on the composition of the leopard seals' blubber was clearer in the inner layer, although neither outer nor inner layers exactly matched the FA of the potential prey. This suggests that there are other components influencing the FA composition of this predator; therefore, in order to carry out dietary analysis it is important to consider the stratification of blubber and to use the inner layer, where the influence of diet is more evident. This has significant implications for sampling methods in the field. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

School characteristics of mesopelagic fish at South Georgia	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART I-OCEANOGRAPHIC RESEARCH PAPERS												In this paper, we describe the variation in myctophid schools characteristics at South Georgia using multifrequency acoustic data collected annually between November 2007 and January 2012. We studied the relationship between the proximity of land and the distribution and schooling characteristics of myctophid fish. We also examined patterns in schooling behaviour in relation to oceanographic data. Fish schools were identified using a dual-frequency dB identification method (Sv120-38 kHz), where negative Sv120-38 kHz is indicative of gas-bearing organisms, such as swimbladdered fish. Available net data were used to provide information on the meosopelagic fish community in the region. School morphometrics (e.g. length, thickness, area) data were extracted and pooled according to their distance from the shore (0-30 km, 30-60 km, 60-90 km, 90-120 km). A total of 578 schools were detected in the survey region and there was high variation in school backscattering strength (NASC), length, height, perimeter, depth and horizontal distribution between surveys, including distinct inter-annual variation in these parameters when surveys were conducted in the same season (2009-2012). Schools were distributed predominantly on-shelf (0-500 m isobaths) during some summer surveys (2007 and 2012) and predominantly off-shelf on others ( > 500 m isobaths; 2009,2010 and 2011). There was also evidence of bathymetric separation in the horizontal distribution of schools. Schools observed in the late-season in 2008 had the greatest NASC, largest height and the deepest depth distribution. Most schools occurred at depths between similar to 60 and 300 m, but they did not occupy the same water masses during each survey. Schools became progressively thinner, shallower and acoustically weaker with increasing distance to land, whilst school length and perimeter increased correspondingly. The change in fish schooling behaviour between environments could be a response to a combination of local predatory threats over short spatial/temporal scales and differences in oceanographic conditions, such as current velocity. The trend could also be evidence of spatial habitat partitioning of myctophids, with different schooling species, or different life-stages, orientating along a bathymetric gradient at South Georgia.

J	Lehette, P; Hernandez-Leon, S				Lehette, Pascal; Hernandez-Leon, Santiago			Carbon dioxide production rates of marine epipelagic copepods in subtropical waters during the late winter bloom	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY												Carbon dioxide production rates of mixed epipelagic copepods were measured during the so-called late winter bloom in the vicinity of the Canary Islands. Respiration rates were measured using a simple and sensitive infra-red gas analyser coupled to a manifold containing an equilibrator module to transfer seawater CO2 to the gas phase. The system allowed the determination of the carbon dioxide content of one sample in 20 to 40 min. Respiration rates obtained were similar to previous oxygen consumption rates in subtropical waters. A relative wide range of carbon dioxide production rates was observed due to the metabolic condition of the organisms. Direct measurement of respiration rates after the capture showed high values (11-fold) compared to standard rates at starving conditions after only 4-6 h of incubation in filtered seawater. The results showed that short-term (0.5 h) CO2 production rates by copepods can be measured in relatively large incubation volumes (600 ml) minimizing crowding and bottle effects. A standardized method is proposed in order to obtain comparable results of metabolic rates in marine mesozooplankton. (C) 2010 Published by Elsevier B.V.

J	GLEITZ, M; THOMAS, DN				GLEITZ, M; THOMAS, DN			VARIATION IN PHYTOPLANKTON STANDING STOCK, CHEMICAL-COMPOSITION AND PHYSIOLOGY DURING SEA-ICE FORMATION IN THE SOUTHEASTERN WEDDELL SEA, ANTARCTICA	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY												Changes in physico-chemical conditions, phytoplankton biomass, biochemical composition and primary productivity were investigated during autumnal sea-ice formation in the southeastern Weddell Sea, Antarctica. During sea-ice growth, brine salinities gradually increased with decreasing temperatures. Nutrient concentrations in the brine of sea ice older than 2 weeks were lower than calculated from initial surface seawater values. The concomittant accumulation of phytoplankton biomass could not be explained solely by physical enrichment. We suggest that several microalgal species retained the capacity to assimilate nutrients and continued to grow in newly formed sea ice. However, nutrient depletions were moderate, and biochemical analyses did not indicate nutrient stress of algal metabolism. Relative abundance of smaller diatom species increased during ice growth, suggesting that pore space available for colonization in conjunction with physiological acclimation capacity were major factors determining successional patterns in recently formed sea ice. Even though ice algal assemblages apparently sustained the capacity to acclimate to reduced irradiances brought about by ice growth and increasing snow cover, maximum primary production was considerably lower than values usually reported from spring and summer ice communities. Therefore, autumnal primary production in newly formed sea ice may not add greatly to total annual production, but may provide an important food source for ice-associated grazers during the winter period, when phytoplankton biomass in the water column is extremely low.

Temperature-Induced Hatch Failure and Nauplii Malformation in Antarctic Krill	FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE												Antarctic krill inhabit areas of the Southern Ocean that can exceed 4.0 degrees C, yet they preferentially inhabit regions with temperatures of -1.5 to <= 1.5 degrees C. Successful embryonic development and hatching are key to their life cycle, but despite the rapid climatic warming seen across their main spawning areas, the effects of elevated temperatures on embryogenesis, hatching success, and nauplii malformations are unknown. We incubated 24,483 krill embryos in two independent experiments to investigate the hypothesis that temperatures exceeding 1.5 degrees C have a negative impact on hatching success and increase the numbers of malformed nauplii. Field experiments were on krill collected from near the northern, warm limit of their range and embryos incubated soon after capture, while laboratory experiments were on embryos from krill acclimated to laboratory conditions. The hatching success of embryo batches varied enormously, from 0 to 98% (mean 27%). Both field and laboratory experiments showed that hatching success decreased markedly above 3.0 degrees C. Our field experiments also showed an approximate doubling of the percentage of malformed nauplii at elevated temperatures, reaching 50% at 5.0 degrees C. At 3.0 degrees C or below, however, temperature was not the main factor driving the large variation in embryo hatching success. Our observations of highly variable and often low success of hatching to healthy nauplii suggest that indices of reproductive potential of female krill relate poorly to the subsequent production of viable krill larvae and may help to explain spatial discrepancies between the distribution of the spawning stock and larval distribution.

The oils contained a high proportion of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) (26.78-45.36% of total FAs), especially eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) (8.17-10.48% of total FAs) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) (7.83-21.34% of total FAs). The oils also contained a high percentage of PL (39.86-74.05% of total lipids). Among PL, phosphatidylcholine (37.40-52.19 mol%) and phosphatidylethanolamine (34.74-43.10 mol%) were dominant. At least 435, 442, 513, 438, 433 and 437 glycerophospholipid (GP) molecular species were characterized, respectively, in lipids from Cyclina sinensis, Mactra chinensis Philippi, Mactra veneriformis Reeve, Meretrix meretrix, Ruditapes phliippinarum and Saxidomus purpurata.

In recent years, the proportion of Atlantic inflow from the south has increased. Concurrently, one temperate-boreal (Meganyctiphanes norvegica) and one subtropical-temperate (Nematoscelis megalops) krill species are now regularly found in the Kongsfjord, in addition to the previously prevailing arcto-boreal species Thysanoessa inermis and T. raschii. In light of the recent changes in these species' biogeographic distributions, we compared their physiological tolerances. Using non-invasive optical oxygen sensors, respiration measurements served to characterize metabolic responses to temperature variations. The 2 Thysanoessa spp. appeared more cold-stenotherm than the other 2 krill species: the upper level of their respiratory capacity was reached at 12 degrees C and they were less tolerant of decreasing oxygen concentrations. This finding is consistent with their arcto-boreal distribution. In contrast, M. norvegica and N. megalops exhibited higher tolerance to temperature changes, robust nutritional condition and sexual maturity. Such physiological plasticity may explain the recent northward expansion of these species' geographic range.

Advances in Marine Ecosystem Dynamics from US GLOBEC The Horizontal-Advection Bottom-up Forcing Paradigm	OCEANOGRAPHY												A primary focus of the US Global Ocean Ecosystem Dynamics (GLOBEC) program was to identify the mechanisms of ecosystem response to large-scale climate forcing under the assumption that bottom-up forcing controls a large fraction of marine ecosystem variability. At the beginning of GLOBEC, the prevailing bottom-up forcing hypothesis was that climate-induced changes in vertical transport modulated nutrient supply and surface primary productivity, which in turn affected the lower trophic levels (e.g., zooplankton) and higher trophic levels (e.g., fish) through the trophic cascade. Although upwelling dynamics were confirmed to be an important driver of ecosystem variability in GLOBEC studies, the use of eddy-resolving regional-scale ocean circulation models combined with field observations revealed that horizontal advection is an equally important driver of marine ecosystem variability. Through a synthesis of studies from the four US GLOBEC regions (Gulf of Alaska, Northern California Current, Northwest Atlantic, and Southern Ocean), a new horizontal-advection bottom-up forcing paradigm emerges in which large-scale climate forcing drives regional changes in alongshore and cross-shelf ocean transport that directly impact ecosystem functions (e.g., productivity, species composition, spatial connectivity). The horizontal advection bottom-up forcing paradigm expands the mechanistic pathways through which climate variability and climate change impact the marine ecosystem.

Projected changes of Antarctic krill habitat by the end of the 21st century	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS												Climate change is rapidly shaping the living environment of the most abundant keystone species of the Antarctic marine food web, Antarctic krill. Projected future changes for the krill habitat include a sustained increase in ocean temperature and changes in sea ice and chlorophyll a. Here we investigate how these factors affect the early life history of krill and identify the regions around Antarctica where the impact will be greatest. Our tool is a temperature-dependent krill growth model forced by data from comprehensive greenhouse warming simulations. We find that by the year 2100 localized regions along the western Weddell Sea, isolated areas of the Indian Antarctic , and the Amundsen/Bellingshausen Sea will support successful spawning habitats for krill. The failure of potentially successful spawning will have a strong impact on the already declining adult populations with consequences for the Antarctic marine food web, having both ecological and commercial ramifications.																	0094-8276	1944-8007				AUG 28	2016	43	16					8580	8589		10.1002/2016GL069656							WOS:000384443800030

Thirty-four seals (16 M 18 F) were outfitted with Satellite Relay Data Loggers (SRDLs) in the Marguerite Bay Region of the Antarctic Peninsula (similar to67degreesS, 67degreesW) during the austral winters of 2001 and 2002. Tags transmitted position and dive information for between 4 and 174 days. Overall, winter activity patterns differed significantly from previously reported data collected during the summer: seals in this study dived deeper (92 +/- 0.2 m, range 6-713 m) and longer (5.26 min +/- 0.6, range 0.2-23.6 min), hauled out during the night rather than the day, and showed seasonal shifts in foraging patterns consistent with foraging on vertically migrating prey. While these patterns were more pronounced in 2001 than in 2002, there were no strong differences in patterns of habitat use between the 2 years. Some animals made long distance movements (furthest movements 664 km to northeast, 1147 km to southwest), but most seals remained within 300 km of their tagging location. Within the Marguerite Bay/Crystal Sound region, seals appeared to favor foraging locations on the continental shelf within the 50 to 450 m depth range, with a tendency to avoid depths of 600 m or greater. In both years, seals remained deep within the pack ice throughout the winter, and did not move into regions with less ice cover. Seals were more likely to be located in shallow water where the bathymetric gradients were greatest, and in areas of higher sea-ice concentration. In combination, these findings suggest that crabeater seals alter their behavior to accommodate seasonal and/or annual fluctuations in seasonal sea ice and associate with bathymetric features likely to concentrate prey patches.

J	Atkinson, A; Whitehouse, MJ				Atkinson, A; Whitehouse, MJ			Ammonium regeneration by Antarctic mesozooplankton: an allometric approach	MARINE BIOLOGY												Given the importance of copepods in the Southern Ocean food web, there are few assessments of their N budgets or their role in regenerating N. In this study we measured elemental composition and ammonium-excretion rates of copepods and small euphausiids, and estimated the role of metazoans in recycling ammonium in the South Georgia region. Measurements were made during summer on animals ranging over about two orders of magnitude in body mass. A phytoplankton bloom extended throughout the study area, and high C and dry masses of late-stage copepodites suggested good recent feeding conditions. Excretion rates declined roughly exponentially during the similar to1 day incubations in filtered sea water. The patterns observed suggested that the onset of starvation rather than the stress of capture caused this. Allometric relationships between body mass in and excretion rate R were derived using the equation R = am(b). Large compilations of literature data produce a value of b (the body-mass scaling coefficient) of 0.7-0.8. However, in this study, b ranged from 0.57 (for C as the unit of body mass) to 0.71 for N as the unit of body mass. Such low values are also common to previous studies of feeding and excretion among Antarctic copepods. We suggest that this reflects peculiarities of polar environments, namely, lipid storage and diapause in the largest copepods. Previous studies have suggested that ammonium is a preferred N source for algae at South Georgia. Based on the monitoring of a region to the north-east of South Georgia and on zooplankton abundance and excretion rates from this study, we estimate that within the upper mixed layer the copepods and small euphausiids excrete at least one third of the ammonium potentially required by phytoplankton. Krill excretion in this area was measured in a previous study, and it appears that mesozooplankton and krill are together significant regenerators of N in parts of the South Georgia pelagic system.																	0025-3162					AUG	2001	139	2					301	311									WOS:000170744200009						
J	Kock, KH; Reid, K; Croxall, J; Nicol, S				Kock, Karl-Hermann; Reid, Keith; Croxall, John; Nicol, Stephen			Fisheries in the Southern Ocean: an ecosystem approach	PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES												The Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR) is bound by its Article II, 3 to follow an ecosystem approach to management. This approach has been extended to the application of a precautionary approach in the late 1980s. In our review, we deal primarily with the science-related aspects of CCAMLR and its development towards an ecosystem approach to the management of the living resources of the Southern Ocean. To assist the Commission in meeting its objectives, as set out in Article II, 3, the Scientific Committee established the CCAMLR Ecosystem Monitoring Programme to detect possible effects of krill fishing on the performance of top-level predators, such as albatrosses, penguins, petrels and fur seals. Fisheries in the Southern Ocean followed the fate of other fisheries worldwide in which target species were depleted to low level one after the other. Currently, two types of fisheries are open: the longline fisheries on Patagonian toothfish (Dissostichus eleginoides) and Antarctic toothfish (Dissostichus mawsoni) and the trawl fisheries on mackerel icefish (Champsocephalus gunnari). Both fisheries are managed in a single-species context, however, with conservation measures in place to protect by-catch species, such as rattails (Macrouridae) and skates and rays (Rajidae). Two major problems still exist in fisheries in the Southern Ocean: the by-catch of birds in longline fisheries primarily in the Indian Ocean and the high level of IUU fishing again in the Indian Ocean. Both, the by-catch of birds and high IUU catches undermine the credibility of CCAMLR to safeguard the marine living resources in the Southern Ocean.																	0962-8436	1471-2970				DEC 29	2007	362	1488					2333	2349		10.1098/rstb.2006.1954							WOS:000250644100010	17553767					
J	PERISSINOTTO, R				PERISSINOTTO, R			MESOZOOPLANKTON SIZE-SELECTIVITY AND GRAZING IMPACT ON THE PHYTOPLANKTON COMMUNITY OF THE PRINCE EDWARD ARCHIPELAGO (SOUTHERN-OCEAN)	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												Dense phytoplankton blooms are often found during austral summer and autumn in the Prince Edward Archipelago (47-degrees-S, 38-degrees-E). These blooms are dominated by the large diatoms Chaetoceros radicans and Rhizosolenia curvata and by the silicoflagellate Dictyocha speculum. Size-selectivity experiments, using the dominant herbivorous zooplankton found in the area, show that the nano-phytoplankton is preferentially selected by all taxa. Only 2 euphausiid species appear to have a significant (p < 0.05) positive selection for the smaller netplankton (20 to 37-mu-m). Poor utilization of these diatom blooms is also supported by the results of a comparative study of grazing impact during a bloom (April 1985) and a non-bloom condition (April/May 1989). When phytoplankton biomass is low, the zooplankton community ingests 33 to 48% of the euphotic zone chlorophyll a per day, or 76 to 81% of daily primary production. However, during bloom conditions the grazing impact is reduced to only 5 to 10% of chlorophyll a concentration and 9 to 17% of primary production per day. Preferential selection for the smaller cells may have an energetic significance as nanoplankton seems to represent a food source of higher nutritional value than bloom-generating diatoms. It is suggested that the bulk of the phytoplankton blooms sinks out of the photic zone and provides an important transfer of biomass from the pelagic to the benthic subsystems.																	0171-8630					JAN	1992	79	3					243	258									WOS:A1992HJ85100005						
J	McQuinn, IH; Plourde, S; St Pierre, JF; Dion, M				McQuinn, Ian H.; Plourde, Stephane; St Pierre, Jean-Francois; Dion, Maxime			Spatial and temporal variations in the abundance, distribution, and aggregation of krill (Thysanoessa raschii and Meganyctiphanes norvegica) in the lower estuary and Gulf of St. Lawrence	PROGRESS IN OCEANOGRAPHY												The opportunistic collection of hydroacoustic data during multipurpose, large-scale surveys since 2000 has led to the detection of several, newly-documented krill concentrations throughout the Gulf of St. Lawrence. Based on both historical and these recent results, a series of regional-scale acoustic surveys was initiated in the northwestern Gulf and estuary to quantify the spatial and temporal variations in the regional abundance, distribution and aggregation of northern and Arctic krill. By using a recently-developed multi-frequency method to classify these two krill species, our study re-evaluated the species-specific krill distribution and abundance, previously monitored by plankton-net sampling alone. We show that Thysanoessa raschii is the more coastal species, with its center-of-mass in the shelf and slope habitats. Meganyctiphanes norvegica forms generally less dense aggregations in the slope and channel habitats. Biomass in the northwestern Gulf and estuary was split 60:40 between T. raschii and M. norvegica, and totaled 1.0 million tonnes in August 2009; substantially more than has been reported previously. This re-evaluation should have considerable impact on ecosystem models which have assumed much lower values for these important forage populations. The pattern of krill aggregations identified from large- and regional-scale surveys will have important implications for the interpretation of critical habitat for endangered marine mammals which depend on krill.

J	Melbourne-Thomas, J; Constable, A; Wotherspoon, S; Raymond, B				Melbourne-Thomas, Jessica; Constable, Andrew; Wotherspoon, Simon; Raymond, Ben			Testing Paradigms of Ecosystem Change under Climate Warming in Antarctica	PLOS ONE												Antarctic marine ecosystems have undergone significant changes as a result of human activities in the past and are now responding in varied and often complicated ways to climate change impacts. Recent years have seen the emergence of large-scale mechanistic explanations-or "paradigms of change"-that attempt to synthesize our understanding of past and current changes. In many cases, these paradigms are based on observations that are spatially and temporally patchy. The West Antarctic Peninsula (WAP), one of Earth's most rapidly changing regions, has been an area of particular research focus. A recently proposed mechanistic explanation for observed changes in the WAP region relates changes in penguin populations to variability in krill biomass and regional warming. While this scheme is attractive for its simplicity and chronology, it may not account for complex spatio-temporal processes that drive ecosystem dynamics in the region. It might also be difficult to apply to other Antarctic regions that are experiencing some, though not all, of the changes documented for the WAP. We use qualitative network models of differing levels of complexity to test paradigms of change for the WAP ecosystem. Importantly, our approach captures the emergent effects of feedback processes in complex ecological networks and provides a means to identify and incorporate uncertain linkages between network elements. Our findings highlight key areas of uncertainty in the drivers of documented trends, and suggest that a greater level of model complexity is needed in devising explanations for ecosystem change in the Southern Ocean. We suggest that our network approach to evaluating a recent and widely cited paradigm of change for the Antarctic region could be broadly applied in hypothesis testing for other regions and research fields.

J	PETRI, G; ZAUKE, GP				PETRI, G; ZAUKE, GP			TRACE-METALS IN CRUSTACEANS IN THE ANTARCTIC OCEAN	AMBIO												To evaluate whether metal concentrations in crustaceans from the Antarctic Ocean may be suitable as indicators of background levels, the elements Cd, Pb, Cu and Zn were analyzed in 17 species. Samples were taken from RV Polarstern in the Weddell Sea (2/1985; 11/1986; 11/1987) and during the first German Underwater Expedition to the Antarctic Peninsula (2/1988). Metal concentrations found show considerable interspecific heterogeneity without consistent dependence on higher taxa. They are not low compared to other areas with the exceptation of Pb. In contrast, observed Cd levels in caridean decapods (Chorismus antarcticus and Notocrangon antarcticus) were among the highest Cd concentrations observed in marine crustaceans (13 mg kg(-1) d.w.). Cu and Zn concentrations are in many cases within ranges given in the literature. Extremely low Cu concentrations in the amphipod Maxilliphimedia longipes and the isopod Aega antarctica (6-8 mg kg(-1)) support the hypothesis that certain Antarctic species may show Cu deficiencies or reduced metal requirements. Therefore, Antarctic organisms should not be used as the basis for global background levels in monitoring studies. Toxicokinetic experiments with organisms from the Antarctic Ocean are necessary to obtain more insight into accumulation strategies as a basis for a ''calibration'' and an interpretation of observed whole-body metal concentrations.																	0044-7447					DEC	1993	22	8					529	536									WOS:A1993MU49700006						
J	EICKEN, H				EICKEN, H			THE ROLE OF SEA ICE IN STRUCTURING ANTARCTIC ECOSYSTEMS	POLAR BIOLOGY												This paper focusses on the links between growth, persistence and decay of sea ice and the structure of Antarctic marine ecosystems on different spatial and temporal scales. Sea-ice growth may divide an oceanic ecosystem into two dissimilar compartments: (1) the water column, with primary production controlled by the reduction of irradiative fluxes due to the snow-laden sea-ice cover and thermo-haline convection, and (2) the pore space within the ice with incorporated organisms switching from a planktonic to a "kryohaline" mode of life. In the ice, physical boundary conditions are set by (1) the irradiance which is controlled by the optical properties of snow and ice and (2) the ambient temperature which controls salinity and brine volume. Partly due to the high levels of biomass within the sea-ice system, interaction between different groups of organisms concentrates on the planar environment predefined by the ice cover. As a result of regional structuring of ecosystems, four sea-ice regimes may be recognized: seasonal pack ice, coastal zone, perennial pack ice, and marginal ice zone. These regimes are interwoven through the temporal structuring of ecosystems brought about by ice-cover seasonality and ice drift. In comparison with open-water pelagic ecosystems, sea ice appears of particular importance as it partly inverts the ecosystem structure and enhances the degree of ecological variability.

Valorisation and enhanced sustainability of Senegalese sole (Solea senegalensis) aquaculture by dietary use of ditch shrimp (Palaemonetes varians) meal	AQUACULTURE												The European Blue Growth Strategy requires innovative proposals contributing to sustainable development of the aquaculture activity. Within this context, ditch shrimp (Palaemonetes varians) meal obtained from extensively managed aquaculture wetlands was assessed as a potential source to substitute dietary fishmeal (FM) in compound diets for Senegalese sole (Solea senegalensis) juveniles. Estuarine ditch shrimp biomass from an integrated aquaculture system was converted into a meal that contained 61.9% protein and 9.2% lipid on a dry matter (DM) basis. The n-3 highly unsaturated fatty acids (HUFA) constituted the main fraction of the polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA). Three isonitrogenous (55% DM), isolipidic (12% DM) and isoenergetic (17 kJ g(-1) DM) diets containing three substitution levels of FM by ditch shrimp meal (SM) were elaborated: 100% FM + 0% SM (SMO); 50% FM + 50% SM (SM50) and 0% FM + 100% SM (5M100). The experimental diets were tested on duplicate groups of sole juveniles (similar to 4 g body weight) in an experiment that lasted 63 days. The substitution of dietary FM with SM did not influence growth and feed intake of the reared fish. Juveniles fed SM100 significantly decreased their muscle and skin lipid depositions in comparison with soles fed SMO. Moreover, muscle lipid analyses showed arachidonic acid (ARA) enrichment caused by the SM dietary use and a major presence of the n-3 over n-6 PUFA. Overall results demonstrate that dietary incorporation of P. varians meal in compound diets for Senegalese sole would add nutritional value to the harvested product with no impact on growth performance of reared fish. The dietary use of a low trophic level marine resource is an innovative practice that may contribute to a further sustainable development of aquaculture of carnivorous fish species.

J	Zhou, M				Zhou, M			What determines the slope of a plankton biomass spectrum?	JOURNAL OF PLANKTON RESEARCH												A number of studies have been performed to understand the characteristics of biomass (size) spectra in aquatic plankton communities around the world. Although the area below a biomass spectrum curve represents the abundance or biomass of a plankton community, it has been hypothesized that the slope and shape of a biomass spectrum are determined by rates of growth, respiration, mortality and trophic dynamics. Observations of biomass spectra indicate that the slope of a biomass spectrum is around -1 on the logarithmic coordinates. Empirical hypotheses of growth-survival and the theoretical framework on biomass conservation based on the rates of individual body growth and abundance change have been developed for interpreting the slope and domes of a biomass spectrum. Here, a mathematical method is developed for estimating specific rates of body growth and abundance change from observations of biomass spectra, and a mathematical model is constructed for the relationship between a biomass spectrum slope, community assimilation efficiency and trophic levels.																	0142-7873	1464-3774				MAY	2006	28	5					437	448		10.1093/plankt/fbi119							WOS:000237170700001						
J	Kim, D; Kim, DY; Kim, YJ; Kang, YC; Shim, J				Kim, D; Kim, DY; Kim, YJ; Kang, YC; Shim, J			Downward fluxes of biogenic material in Bransfield Strait, Antarctica	ANTARCTIC SCIENCE												Time-series sediment traps were deployed to investigate the temporal evolution of particle fluxes in eastern and central Bransfield Strait, from December 1999-December 2000. Particle fluxes showed large seasonal variation at both trap sites. In eastern Bransfield Strait, summer mass fluxes were two orders of magnitude higher than winter mass fluxes, while in central Bransfield Strait, almost 99% of the annual mass flux (33 g m(-2)) was collected in a 40-day period from December-January. Export flux also exhibited a high regional variability. This regional variability is probably due to central Bransfield Strait's strong surface current, which carries most settling particles produced in the surface waters away from the mooring site during the low summer flux period. The relatively low biogenic silica to organic carbon ratios (a range of 0.29-1.4) and high lithogenic fluxes (41% of total mass flux) indicate that the growth of phytoplankton is not limited by the micronutrient iron in eastern Bransfield Strait. The annual flux of organic carbon in eastern Bransfield Strait was 6.8 g C m(-2), which is three times higher than the flux measured in central Bransfield Strait (2.2 g C m (-2)). Organic carbon flux in eastern Bransfield Strait is relatively high for the Southern Ocean, possibly due to fast-sinking faecal pellets that lead to less decomposition of organic material in the water column. Calculations suggest that approximately 7.2% of the organic carbon produced at the surface in eastern Bransfield Strait is exported to a depth of 678 m. This exceeds the maximum calculated export of primary production to a depth of 1000 m in the Atlantic and Southern oceans.																	0954-1020	1365-2079				SEP	2004	16	3					227	237		10.1017/S0954102004002032							WOS:000224403300002

The extraction yields of lipids from hepatopancreas (10.65-12.64%) were higher than those from cephalothorax (2.59-2.88%). However, no changes in the extraction yield were observed during the storage (p > 0.05). The carotenoid contents of lipids from cephalothorax and hepatopancreas slightly increased within the first 2 and 4 days of iced storage (p < 0.05), respectively, but decreased thereafter (p < 0.05). With increasing storage time, a progressive formation of hydroperoxide was found as evidenced by the increase in the absorbance band at 3600-3200 cm(-1) in Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra, and increased peroxide values (PVs) (p < 0.05). The increases in thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS), p-anisidine value (Any) and free fatty acid (FFA) content of lipids were noticeable when iced storage time increased (p < 0.05). Those changes indicated that lipid oxidation and hydrolysis occurred in both samples. Phospholipids (PL) were the major components in lipids from cephalothorax (82.51% of total lipids). Nevertheless, lipids from hepatopancreas contained triglyceride (TG) and PL as the dominant components (45.35% and 38.03% of total lipids, respectively). A decrease in the TG content with a concomitant increase in free fatty acid was observed at the end of storage (day 6) (p < 0.05). Decreases in unsaturated fatty acids, especially eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA; C20:5(n-3)) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA; C22:6(n-3)) were noticeable at day 6 of storage (p < 0.05). Thus, the extended storage time resulted in the enhanced deterioration of extracted lipids. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Combined with biomass of the krill community, the grazing potential on phytoplankton along the fjord was estimated. Gut evacuation rates were 3.9 and 2.3 h(-1) for T. raschii and T. inermis, respectively. Ingestion rates were 12.2 +/- A 7.5 A mu g C mg C-1 day(-1) (n = 4) for T. inermis and 4.9 +/- A 3.2 A mu g C mg C-1 day(-1) (n = 4) for T. raschii, corresponding to daily rations of 1.2 and 0.5 % body carbon day(-1). Clearance experiments conducted in parallel to the gut evacuation experiment gave similar results for ingestion rates and daily rations. Krill biomass was highest in the central part of the fjord's length, with T. raschii dominating. Community grazing rates from krill and copepods were comparable; however, their combined impact was low, estimated as < 1 % of phytoplankton standing stock being removed per day during this late spring study.

Marine copepods of the genus Calanus can reproduce prior to the spring bloom in the absence of sufficient food. Their starvation physiology, and hence the factors limiting their pre-bloom population growth (egg production), remain poorly understood. 2. Stoichiometric theory can provide insights into the factors controlling an organism's growth and the fate of elements in an ecosystem. It is underpinned by substrate utilization efficiencies that relate to key physiological processes such as absorption efficiencies (AEs) and biomass turnover. These parameters are seldom investigated, particularly in the case of essential 'micronutrients' such as the polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). 3. Calanus spp. were fed briefly and subsequently starved for 5 days to determine basal turnover rates of biomass carbon, nitrogen and essential PUFAs. The effect of short-term fasting on nitrogen isotope signatures was also examined. The elemental, fatty acid and isotopic composition of their faecal pellets were compared to that of their food, providing insights into AEs and digestive isotopic discrimination. 4. Gut AEs typically followed the sequence: PUFA > nitrogen > carbon, although low AE for DHA was a notable exception. Starvation-induced losses of carbon, nitrogen, EPA and DHA demonstrate that homeostatic organisms must ingest all of these substrates in substantial quantity to achieve positive net growth. 5. Egested material was significantly depleted in 13C and 15N relative to the ingested food. We attribute this to isotopic discrimination at the macromolecular level, indicating that food quality contributes to the isotopic signature of a consumer organism. Values of delta 15N in the copepods' tissues did not increase during starvation, despite significant losses of bulk nitrogen. This supports the suggestion that dissimilatory protein pathways in marine crustaceans are non-discriminating. 6. The significant basal turnover rates and variable AEs for essential PUFAs and nitrogen presented herein demonstrate that organisms cannot be assumed to utilize all nutritious substrates with the same, high efficiency, even when scarce in the diet. Our data highlight the need for a more detailed understanding of organismal physiology before isotopic and stoichiometric models can be meaningfully constructed and parameterized.

Samples of the squid Moroteuthis ingens taken from around the Falkland Islands and Macquarie Island were used to test a null hypothesis that M. ingens forms a single, parimictic population in the Southern Ocean. Six of the 8 arbitrary RAPD primers screened produced a total of 30 reproducible polymorphic bands. Analysis of RAPD allele frequencies demonstrated high levels of variation between individuals but little variation between two sample sites. Although the differentiation between the two sites was low, subtle population structure was detected and the null hypothesis was rejected. The implications of low genetic differentiation between the two sites are briefly discussed in terms of possible egg and para-larval drift facilitated via the circumpolar current.

Export production and its regulating factors in the West Antarctica Peninsula region of the Southern Ocean	GLOBAL BIOGEOCHEMICAL CYCLES												In connection with the Palmer LTER program, mixed layer water samples were collected during the cruise of the L. M. Gould in Jan., 2008 at 49 stations on a 20 x 100 km grid in the West Antarctica Peninsula (WAP) region of the Southern Ocean. In this study, [O-2]/[Ar] ratios and the triple isotope composition of dissolved O-2 were measured, and were used to estimate net community O-2 production (NCP) and gross primary O-2 production (GPP), respectively. These estimates are further converted to carbon export production, primary production and the f-ratio. Our measurements give NCP ranging from -3 to 76 mmol O-2 m(-2) day(-1) (-25 to 650 mg C m(-2) day(-1)), and GPP from 40 to 220 mmol O-2 m(-2) day(-1) (180 to 1010 mg C m(-2) day(-1)). The O-2 NCP/GPP ratios range from -0.04 to 0.43, corresponding to f-ratios of -0.08 to 0.83. NCP and the NCP/GPP ratio are highest in the northern coastal areas, and decrease to lower values toward the southern coastal area and the open ocean. The inshore-offshore gradient appears to be regulated primarily by iron availability, as supported by the positive correlation between NCP and F-v/F-m ratios (r(2) = 0.22, p < 0.05). Mixed layer depth (MLD) is inversely correlated with NCP (r(2) = 0.21, p < 0.002) and NCP/GPP (r(2) = 0.21, p < 0.02), and highest NCP occurred in the fresh water lenses probably formed from melted coastal glaciers. These results suggest that export production and the f-ratio increase where water stratification is intensified by input of fresh meltwater, and that mixed layer stratification is the major factor regulating NCP in the inner-shelf and coastal regions. Along-shelf variability of phytoplankton community composition is highly correlated with NCP, i.e., NCP increases when the diatom-dominated community in the south transitions to the cryptophyte-dominated one in the north. A high correlation is also observed between NCP and the logarithm of the surface chlorophyll concentration (r(2) = 0.72, p < 0.0001), which makes it possible to estimate carbon export as a function of Chl a concentration in this region.

Salps in the Lazarev Sea, Southern Ocean: II. Biochemical composition and potential prey value	MARINE BIOLOGY												Two species of salps, Salpa thompsoni and Ihlea racovitzai, were sampled during three cruises to the Lazarev Sea, Southern Ocean, in summer (December-January) 2005/2006, Autumn (April-May) 2004 and Winter (July-August) 2006. Dry weight, carbon, nitrogen, protein, lipid and carbohydrate contents were measured to characterize the potential value of salps as a food source for predators in the Antarctic ecosystem. Biochemical composition measurements showed that despite having a high percentage of water (similar to 94% of wet weight), both species had relatively high carbon and protein contents in their remaining dry weight (DW). In particular I. racovitzai showed high carbon (up to 22% of DW) and protein (up to 32% of DW) values during all seasons sampled, compared to lower values for S. thompsoni (carbon content only about 15% of the DW, protein content about 10% of the DW). At the same time, carbohydrates (CH) and lipids (Lip) only accounted for a small portion of salp DW in both species (1.4% CH and 3.6% Lip for I. racovitzai; 2.1% CH and 2.9% Lip for S. thompsoni). There was little variability in the biochemical composition of either salp species between the seasons sampled. Both biochemical composition and life cycle characteristics suggest that Antarctic salps, especially I. racovitzai, may be important prey items for both cold and warm-blooded predators in an environment where food is often very scarce.																	0025-3162					JAN	2012	159	1					15	24		10.1007/s00227-011-1785-5							WOS:000299198900002						
J	Tahergorabi, R; Sivanandan, L; Jaczynski, J				Tahergorabi, Reza; Sivanandan, Litha; Jaczynski, Jacek			Dynamic rheology and endothermic transitions of proteins recovered from chicken-meat processing by-products using isoelectric solubilization/precipitation and addition of TiO2	LWT-FOOD SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												Chicken-meat processing generates large quantities of by-products (backs, necks, etc.). Dark chicken-meat processing by-products present the lowest value and greatest challenge. Therefore, recovery of functional proteins from this source for inclusion in food products resembling those from light chicken-meat presents the greatest value addition and opportunity. Novel isoelectric solubilization/precipitation (ISP) was applied to model, dark chicken-meat processing by-products (skin-on bone-in chicken drumsticks) to recover muscle proteins. Thermal denaturation (endothermic transitions), gelation (elasticity, G'), and fundamental texture properties (shear stress and strain at mechanical fracture) of the ISP-recovered proteins were determined with differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), dynamic rheometer, and torsion test, respectively; and compared to boneless skinless chicken breast. Endothermic transition of myosin was not detected only when TiO2 was not added, while the ISP-recovered proteins with TiO2 showed small myosin peak and large actin peak. However, the level of TiO2 addition did not affect thermal transition/denaturation of the ISP-recovered proteins. The ISP-recovered proteins had a greater transition for actin compared to chicken breast, suggesting that ISP predisposes this protein to thermal denaturation. Similar to endothermic transitions, elasticity (G') generally increased when TiO2 was added to the ISP-recovered proteins. Gels made of chicken breast had the highest (P < 0.05) shear stress (i.e., gel strength), but gels made of the ISP-recovered chicken proteins had greater (P < 0.05) shear strain (i.e., gel cohesiveness). Addition of TiO2 to the ISP-recovered proteins resulted in increased (P < 0.05) gel strength. Based on the present study, addition of TiO2 is suggested for the development of restructured food products based on proteins recovered from dark chicken-meat processing by-products using ISP. Although the results of this study point towards a novel food product, further studies are recommended. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Observations and models to support the first Marine Ecosystem Assessment for the Southern Ocean (MEASO)	JOURNAL OF MARINE SYSTEMS												Assessments of the status and trends of habitats, species and ecosystems are needed for effective ecosystem-based management in marine ecosystems. Knowledge on imminent ecosystem changes (climate change impacts) set in train by existing climate forcings are needed for adapting management practices to achieve conservation and sustainabililty targets into the future. Here, we describe a process for enabling a marine ecosystem assessment (MEA) by the broader scientific community to support managers in this way, using a MEA for the Southern Ocean (MEASO) as an example. We develop a framework and undertake an audit to support a MEASO, involving three parts. First, we review available syntheses and assessments of the Southern Ocean ecosystem and its parts, paying special attention to building on the SCAR Antarctic Climate Change and Environment report and the SCAR Biogeographic Atlas of the Southern Ocean. Second, we audit available field observations of habitats and densities and/or abundances of taxa, using the literature as well as a survey of scientists as to their current and recent activities. Third, we audit available system models that can form a nested ensemble for making, with available data, circumpolar assessments of habitats, species and food webs. We conclude that there is sufficient data and models to undertake, at least, a circumpolar assessment of the krill-based system. The auditing framework provides the basis for the first MEASO but also provides a repository (www.SOKI.aq/display/MEASO) for easily amending the audit for future MEASOs. We note that an important outcome of the first MEASO will not only be the assessment but also to advise on priorities in observations and models for improving subsequent MEASOs.

An introduction to EASIZ (Ecology of the Antarctic Sea Ice Zone): An integrated programme of water column, benthos and bentho-pelagic coupling in the coastal environment of Antarctica	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY												The EASIZ (Ecology of the Antarctic Sea Ice Zone) programme ran from 1994 to 2004, and involved over 150 scientists from more than 17 countries. The main scientific aim was an integrated study of the water column and benthos, linked by bentho-pelagic coupling, of the Antarctic continental shelf. Because water-column studies were well served by existing international programmes (SO-JGOFS, SO-GLOBEC) and national biological oceanographic programmes, EASIZ itself concentrated on the benthos and bentho-pelagic coupling. Work in the EASIZ programme has led to the overturning of some previous paradigms, for example that the Antarctic is species-poor, and replaced these with a revised picture linking the assemblage structure and population dynamics to the glacial-marine setting. The legacy of EASIZ is a wide-ranging reassessment of the diversity, history and ecology of the Antarctic benthos, the coupling of this system to water-column processes, and a fundamental revision of our view of physiological adaptation to temperature in polar marine organisms.

Mesozooplankton abundance and biomass were highest at the polar front and south of the front. Biomass increased by 1.5-2-times during the course of the study. Calanoides acutus, Calanus propinquus, C. simillimus, Rhincalanus gigas and Neocalanus tonsus were the dominant large copepods found in the study. Oithona spp and pteropods were numerically important components of the zooplankton community. The copepod and juvenile krill community consumed 1-7% of the daily chlorophyll standing stock, equivalent to 3-21% of the daily phytoplankton production. There was an increased grazing pressure at night due to both increased gut pigment concentrations as well as increases in zooplankton numbers. Phytoplankton carbon contributed a significant fraction (> 50%) of the dietary carbon for the copepods during spring and summer. The relative importance of phytoplankton carbon to the diet increased south of the polar front, suggested that grazing by copepods could be important to organic carbon and biogenic silica flux south of the polar front.

TWO DECADES OF PELAGIC ECOLOGY OF THE WESTERN ANTARCTIC PENINSULA	OCEANOGRAPHY												Significant strides in our understanding of the marine pelagic ecosystem of the Western Antarctic Peninsula (WAP) region have been made over the past two decades, resulting from research conducted aboard ARSV Laurence M. Gould and RVIB Nathaniel B. Palmer. These advances range from an understanding of the physical forcing on biology, to food web ecology (from microbes to top predators), to biogeochemical cycling, often in the larger context of rapid climate warming in the region. The proximity of the WAP to the Antarctic Circumpolar Current and WAP continental shelf bathymetry affects the hydrography and helps structure the biological community. Seasonal, spatial, and interannual variability at all levels of the food web, as well as the mechanisms supporting their production, are now more clearly understood. New tools and technologies employed in the region were critical for making this research possible. As a result, our knowledge of the WAP pelagic ecosystem during a time of rapid climate change has vastly improved.

Functional and nutritional characteristics of proteins and lipids recovered by isoelectric processing of fish by-products and low-value fish: A review	FOOD CHEMISTRY												Several fisheries are over-exploited and may collapse; yet the amounts of fish processing by-products containing muscle proteins and omega-3-rich oil are staggering. The by-products are land-filled, ground and discarded or otherwise diverted from human consumption. Due to the lack of technology to recover proteins and lipids from by-products or low-value species, this tremendous resource is unavailable for human consumption. Isoelectric solubilisation/precipitation (ISP) allows efficient recovery of fish proteins and oil which retain functionality and nutritional value of food products. Isoelectric point (pI) is a pH where protein maintains zero electrostatic charge. At pl, protein-protein hydrophobic attraction overcomes protein-water electrostatic attraction resulting in isoelectric precipitation. Conversely, isoelectric solubilisation occurs at a pH different from pI, whereby protein-water attraction and protein-protein electrostatic repulsion are favoured. Therefore, protein solubility/insolubility is induced by ISP, respectively. Consequently, ISP allows selective protein recovery. Lipids are also recovered during ISP processing. This article reviews recent ISP developments to recover proteins and lipids from by-products and low-value marine species. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Dominici, S; Danise, S; Cau, S; Freschi, A				Dominici, Stefano; Danise, Silvia; Cau, Simone; Freschi, Alessandro			The awkward record of fossil whales	EARTH-SCIENCE REVIEWS												The habitat, actuopaleontology and global fossil record of crown cetaceans, today occupying apex positions in the marine ecosystem, is reviewed. A large Neogene-Quaternary dataset is built, covering the time span of the evolutionary radiation of crown Odontoceti and Mysticeti and including updated information on whale taxonomy, chronostratigraphy, geography, paleoenvironment, taphonomy and size. We outline an uneven chronostratigraphic and geographic distribution of fossils, which influences our understanding of global diversity trends. Notwithstanding the vast majority of whale carcasses sinks to bathyal depths, the fossil record is mainly associated with shelf paleoenvironments. The evolution of gigantic whales triggered the radiation of whale-fall communities, including a global bone-eating fauna that hampers the preservation of carcasses at bathyal depths. This "Osedax" effect may explain the unexpected distribution of the fossil record, particularly in the Pleistocene, when baleen whales became gigantic and the ecosystem engineers they are today. A review of the relative thickness of Pleistocene marine strata rules out artefacts of the rock record. The distribution of taphonomic grades suggests that the average skeletal completeness decreases during the Neogene and Quaternary, consistently with an increased efficiency of bioeroders. The frequency of complete and articulated skeletons is time-independent, suggesting a control by sedimentation rates. Quality of the record is expected to improve particularly from taxonomic studies dedicated to the rich, but unexplored South american record, documenting the record of little known productive regions, such as Africa, the Arctic and Antarctica, and the taphonomy and stratigraphic paleobiology of old and new findings.

Concentrations of silicic acid, nitrate and phosphate (Si/N/P) were measured in the upper water column during January-March of three successive years. samples were taken from eleven depths at 17 stations in 1991, and at four depths at 144 stations in 1992 and 182 stations in 1993. There was considerable variability in the concentrations of all three nutrients within the study area, but silicic acid showed the greatest variance among the water masses present in the sampling grid. The ratios (SI/N/P) of the nutrient deficits (difference in winter and summer values) in the upper 100 m differed considerably in Drake Passage waters as compared to Bransfield Strait waters, with both nitrate and silicic acid showing the greatest variance. Nutrient deficits did not increase from January to February, indicating that rates of replenishment of nutrients to the euphotic zone by physical processes and/or biological regeneration were approximately equal to the rate of uptake and assimilation by phytoplankton during that time period. The seasonal deficits, however, were substantial. Estimates of daily rates of primary production based on these nutrient deficits were comparable to the rates as measured by radiocarbon for Drake Passage waters, but much smaller for Bransfield Strait waters.

In the study area, near the South Orkneys (34-49-degrees-W, 57-61.5-degrees-S), water emerging from the Weddell Sea mixed with Scotia Sea water to form a complex field of mesoscale eddies and meanders. Three primary zooplankton communities were identified: a shallow cold water assemblage typical of Weddell Sea water; a shallow/upper mesopelagic assemblage of subantarctic species introduced into the southern Scotia Sea with warm core eddies from the Polar Front; and a deep (>400 m) mesopelagic community with circumantarctic species. Zooplankton numerical dominants were cyclopoid copepods (mostly Oithona spp.); biomass dominants were four calanoid copepods, Calanoides acutus, Rhincalanus gigas, Calanus propinquus and Metridia gerlachei. Calanoides acutus and R. gigas were undergoing winter diapause in the mesopelagic zone (>400 m) whereas M. gerlachei and C. propinquus were distributed throughout the water column. In the subantarctic eddies M. gerlachei was replaced by M. lucens as a dominant and R. gigas was more abundant than in cold water to the south. Diet analysis of 35 dominant species revealed five feeding guilds among the zooplankton. One consisted primarily of small herbivorous copepods. Two closely related guilds consisting of copepods, krill and salps were omnivorous, feeding on phytoplankton, protozoans, metazoans and crustacean debris (molts). Two guilds were constituted by predatory copepods and chaetognaths. A sixth group, all copepods, which included important numerical and biomass dominants of the region, was trophically inactive. A comparison of gut fullness between winter 1988 and fall 1986 revealed that all but two of 19 small particle grazing species had significantly less food in their guts in winter. The exceptions were the biomass dominants C. propinquus and M. gerlachei, which were actively feeding in winter. Phytoplankton biomass was low in winter, averaging two-thirds that in fall. Several major trophic pathways from phytoplankton through apex predators (birds and mammals) are proposed for winter in the southern Scotia Sea with zooplankton playing a central role in each.																	0967-0637					JAN	1993	40	1					81	105		10.1016/0967-0637(93)90054-7							WOS:A1993KJ94900005

The 2009-2017 acoustic time series analysis revealed that krill distribution, mainly located on the continental shelf edge, was driven by the presence of fronts and submarine canyons. On the other hand, areas of persistent krill distribution included from Cape La Nao to the eastern part of Almeria Bay, although an interannual northwards increase of krill presence had been detected in 2015-2017 likely related to the position of the Balearic front. We provide information on the aggregation characteristics and biological parameters of three krill species, Nyctiphanes couchii, Nematoscelis megalops and Meganyctiphanes norvegica. N. couchii and N. megalops formed patchy pelagic aggregations in the neritic and oceanic zone, respectively, and they were the most common species in the net tows. By contrast, M. norvegica formed a large demersal aggregation on the continental shelf edge and was only found in 2017; nevertheless, its 861-kg catch represented a unique milestone in the Mediterranean.

Light absorbance by the carapace of Gondogeneia antarctica and Djerboa furcipes was higher in the UVR (UVB + UVA) range (42. 1 % and 54.5% on average respectively) compared to the PAR (photosynthetically active radiation) range (38. 1 % and 50. 1 % respectively) of the solar spectrum. Bands of higher absorbance correlated with maximal absorbance ranges of sunscreening compounds indicating mycosporine-like amino acids (MAAs) and carotenoids to be innate compounds of the exoskeleton of these species. Though the antioxidant enzyme catalase was photoinhibited, protein damage products did not accumulate under experimental exposure to a daily dose of 6.84 kJ m(-2) d(-1) UVB, 66.24 kJ m(-2) d(-1) UVA and 103.14 kJ m(-2) d(-1) PAR. Animal oxygen consumption during UV-exposure was measured as an indicator of immediate behavioural and physiological stress response. UVB as well as UVA induced a response with altered and highly variable respiratory intensity. Our findings indicate that sub-lethal UVR exposure causes increased oxygen consumption in polar amphipods due to radiation avoidance, shelter seeking behaviour, and presumably also from cellular repair processes.

In a 25,000 km2 sampling area at the western end of Bransfield Strait and during the period from mid-December 1986 to late March 1987, four 2-week cruises were made over a 69-station grid encompassing the coastal shelf, the continental shelf break, numerous island shelves, the Bellingshausen Sea-Weddell Sea confluence, and a portion of Drake Passage. Studies were focused on the upper ocean (0-200 m) and included detailed measurements of hydrography, ocean optics, vertical flux, and the distribution, abundance and productivity of bacteria, phytoplankton, zooplankton and krill. This paper describes the program logistics and presents the results of a carbon flux model, based on empirical observations, for the nearshore pelagic marine ecosystem.

JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY												Ecological niche theory predicts sympatric species to show segregation in their spatio-temporal habitat utilization or diet as a strategy to avoid competition. Similarly, within species individuals may specialize on specific dietary resources or foraging habitats. Such individual specialization seems to occur particularly in environments with predictable resource distribution and limited environmental variability. Still, little is known about how seasonal environmental variability affects segregation of resources within species and between closely related sympatric species. The aim of the study was to investigate the foraging behaviour of three closely related and sympatrically breeding fulmarine petrels (Antarctic petrels Thalassoica antarctica, cape petrels Daption capense and southern fulmars Fulmarus glacialoides) in a seasonally highly variable environment (Prydz Bay, Antarctica) with the aim of assessing inter- and intraspecific overlap in utilized habitat, timing of foraging and diet and to identify foraging habitat preferences. We used GPS loggers with wet/dry sensors to assess spatial habitat utilization over the entire breeding season. Trophic overlap was investigated using stable isotope analysis based on blood, feathers and egg membranes. Foraging locations were identified using wet/dry data recorded by the GPS loggers and expectation-maximization binary clustering. Foraging habitat preferences were modelled using generalized additive models and model cross-validation. During incubation and chick-rearing, the utilization distribution of all three species overlapped significantly and species also overlapped in the timing of foraging during the day-partly during incubation and completely during chick-rearing. Isotopic centroids showed no significant segregation between at least two species for feathers and egg membranes, and among all species during incubation (reflected by blood). Within species, there was no individual specialization in foraging sites or environmental space. Furthermore, no single environmental covariate predicted foraging activity along trip trajectories. Instead, best-explanatory environmental covariates varied within and between individuals even across short temporal scales, reflecting a highly generalist behaviour of birds. Our results may be explained by optimal foraging theory. In the highly productive but spatio-temporally variable Antarctic environment, being a generalist may be key to finding mobile prey-even though this increases the potential for competition within and among sympatric species.

Nutrient dynamics, microalgal biomass, photosynthetic parameters, cell densities and species succession were studied in two mesocosm experiments, designed to simulate the transition of microalgal communities from platelet ice habitat to pelagic conditions. The microalgal assemblages were dominated by diatoms, 70% of which were benthic species such as Amphiprora kufferathii, Nitzschia stellata, and Berkeleya adeliensis. Photoacclimation of benthic species was inadequate also at relatively low irradiances. Exceptional growth capacity at different light levels was observed for pelagic species such as Fragilariopsis cylindrus and Chaetoceros spp. which may be important in seeding blooms at ice breakup. Fragilariopsis cylindrus showed high growth rates both at 65 and 10% of incident light and in nutrient replete as well as in nutrient depleted conditions. Five days after inoculation, phytoplankton biomass increased and nutrient concentrations decreased in both light conditions. Nutrient uptake rates were up to 9.10 mu mol L-1 d(-1) of TIN in the high light tank and 6.18 mu mol L-1 d(-1) in the low light tank and nutrient depletion in the high light tank occurred 3 days prior to depletion in the low light tank. At nutrient depletion, biomass concentrations were similar in both tanks, 30 and 34 mu g Chla L-1.

While the geochemical behaviour of this radionuclide in the marine environment is well known, relatively few studies have explored its interactions with biota. To better understand biologically related Th-234 dynamics, bioaccumulation of Th-234 from the dissolved phase and its subsequent retention in small Antarctic crustaceans (the isopod Natatolana oculata and the amphipods Orchomenella ultima and Uristes stebbingi) was determined under controlled laboratory conditions. Despite morphological and behavioural differences, all three species displayed comparable concentration factors (CF >= 80) and very long retention of Th-234 (biological half-life not significantly different from infinity). From 16% (isopod) to 49% (both amphipods) of accumulated Th-234 was associated with the animal soft parts, which is substantial when compared with reported values for other particle-reactive transuranic elements. The relevance of zooplankton as a potential modulator of Th-234 distribution in the water column is discussed in light of these findings. CF-based computations suggest that, for typical zooplankton biomass, biologically mediated interactions with particle flux models can be neglected. In contrast, in waters with very high crustacean biomass, such as krill schools, Th-234 distribution in the water column would be largely determined by these organisms. In such waters the biological compartment should be addressed as it could confound the reliability of vertical particle flux assessment using Th-234 as a proxy. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Modelled mid-trophic pelagic prey fields improve understanding of marine predator foraging behaviour	ECOGRAPHY												Biophysical interactions are influential in determining the scale of key ecological processes within marine ecosystems. For oceanic predators, this means foraging behaviour is influenced by processes shaping the distribution of prey. However, oceanic prey is difficult to observe and its abundance and distribution is regionally generalised. We use a spatiotemporally resolved simulation model to describe mid-trophic prey distribution within the Southern Ocean and demonstrate insights that this modelled prey field provides into the foraging behaviour of a widely distributed marine predator, the southern elephant seal. From a five-year simulation of prey biomass, we computed climatologies of mean prey biomass (average prey conditions) and prey biomass variability (meso-scale variability). We also compiled spatially gridded metrics of seal density and diving behaviour from 13 yr of tracking data. We statistically modelled these metrics as non-linear functions of prey biomass (both mean and variability) and used these to predict seal distribution and behaviour. Our predictions were consistent with observations (R-adj(2) = 0.23), indicating that seals aggregate in regions of high mesoscale activity where eddies concentrate prey. Here, seals dived deeper (R-marg(2) = 0.12, R-cond(2) = 0.51) and spent less time hunting (R-marg(2) = 0.05, R-cond(2) = 0.56), likely targeting deep but profitable prey patches. Seals generally avoided areas of low eddy activity where prey was likely dispersed. Most seals foraged south of the Subantarctic Front, despite north of the front exhibiting consistently high simulated prey biomasses. This likely reflects seal prey or habitat preferences, but also emphasises the importance of mesoscale prey biomass variability relative to regionally high mean biomass. This work demonstrates the value of coupling mechanistic representations of prey biomass with predator observations to provide insight into how biophysical processes combine to shape species distributions. This will be increasingly important for the robust prediction of species' responses to rapid system change.

Towards population-level conservation in the critically endangered Antarctic blue whale: the number and distribution of their populations	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS												Population-level conservation is required to prevent biodiversity loss within a species, but it first necessitates determining the number and distribution of populations. Many whale populations are still depleted due to 20th century whaling. Whales are one of the most logistically difficult and expensive animals to study because of their mobility, pelagic lifestyle and often remote habitat. We tackle the question of population structure in the Antarctic blue whale (Balaenoptera musculus intermedia) - a critically endangered subspecies and the largest extant animal - by capitalizing on the largest genetic dataset to date for Antarctic blue whales. We found evidence of three populations that are sympatric in the Antarctic feeding grounds and likely occupy separate breeding grounds. Our study adds to knowledge of population structure in the Antarctic blue whale. Future research should invest in locating the breeding grounds and migratory routes of Antarctic blue whales through satellite telemetry to confirm their population structure and allow population-level conservation.

J	Pond, DW; Tarling, GA; Schmidt, K; Everson, I				Pond, David W.; Tarling, Geraint A.; Schmidt, Katrin; Everson, Inigo			Diet and growth rates of Meganyctiphanes norvegica in autumn	MARINE BIOLOGY RESEARCH												Fatty acid biomarkers analysis was performed on juvenile and adult northern krill (Meganyctiphanes norvegica) to determine variability in diet between individuals and the consequences for their growth rates. Animals were sampled from Gullmarsfjorden, western Sweden during September 2004 and incubated for 4 days to measure instantaneous growth rate (IGR) before subsequent fatty acid analysis. We found positive linear relationships between IGR and certain fatty acid concentrations within adult specimens. In particular, highest growth was seen in individuals containing high concentrations of 18:2(n-6) and 18:3(n-6), indicative of filamentous algae and/or terrestrial carbon dietary sources, and 16:4(n-1), a biomarker fatty acid for diatoms. Similar relationships were not evident for juvenile krill. In an accompanying study, stomach content analyses established that adult krill had been feeding on a diverse range of red, brown and green benthic filamentous algae, which contain fatty acids of the (n-6) series. Incidence of filamentous algae in the stomachs of juvenile krill was much lower, possibly reflecting the shallower water depths inhabited by this maturity stage. Although a benthic feeding mode has previously been observed for M. norvegica, this is the first direct evidence to indicate that benthic food sources can be important in supporting the growth of this euphausiid. Furthermore, high variability in growth rates and fatty acid concentrations between individuals suggest a diversity of feeding strategies within this fjordic population.																	1745-1000	1745-1019					2012	8	7					615	623		10.1080/17451000.2011.653366							WOS:000304592600005

Stable delta(13)C ratios ranged from -28.7parts per thousand for the zooplankton plus phytoplankton to -14.4parts per thousand for the grazer Nacella concinna. Microphytobenthos (-16.7parts per thousand) was considerably more enriched in C-13 than were suspended particulate matter (SPM) (-25.6parts per thousand) and macroalgal fragments (-23.6parts per thousand and -21.1parts per thousand), indicating that stable carbon isotope analysis might be used to discern the relative contribution of these sources of primary production. There is a benthic-pelagic coupling between plankton, benthic suspensivores, the ophiuroid Ophionotus victoriae and the icefish Chaenocephalus aceratus. Benthic grazers such as N. concinna, deposit feeders such as Yoldia eightsi and the nematodes showed a tight coupling with the microphytobenthos and the sediment. Some omnivorous/depositivorous polychaetes, echinoids, amphipods and the fish Notothenia coriiceps showed values close to the ratios of the macroalgal fragments. Benthic carnivores and/or scavengers were generally enriched over suspensivores and depleted in relation to microphytobenthos grazers, showing a considerable overlap in delta(13)C values throughout the food web, without any clear coupling with the primary sources of organic matter. The trophic web in the shallow zone of high benthic production and under seasonal ice cover in the Antarctic is more complex than it is in shelf areas, where SPM is the main food source. The soft-bottom community in the shallow zone of Martel Inlet is enriched in C-13 due to the significant input of carbon from the microphytobenthos and macroalgal fragments.

The research was conducted in the framework of the ATOS research project as part of the Spanish contribution to the International Polar Year. The objective was to ascertain the possible consequences of the predicted zooplankton shift from krill to salps in the Southern Ocean for the cycling of biogenic carbon and the concentration and stoichiometry of dissolved inorganic nutrients. The carbon respiratory demands and NH4-N and PO4-P excretion rates of <5 mm size copepods, krill and salps were estimated by incubation experiments. The carbon-specific metabolic rates and N:P metabolic quotients of salps were higher than those of krill (furcilia spp. and adults) and copepods, and as expected there was a significant negative relation between average individual zooplankton biomass and their metabolic rates, each metabolic process showing a particular response that lead to different metabolic N:P ratios. The predicted change from krill to salps in the Southern Ocean would encompass not only the substitution of a pivotal group for Antarctic food webs (krill) by one with an indifferent trophic role (salps). In a zooplankton community dominated by salps the respiratory carbon demand by zooplankton will significantly increase, and therefore the proportion of primary production that should be allocated to compensate for the global respiratory C-losses of zooplankton. At the same time, the higher production by salps of larger, faster sinking fecal pellets will increase the sequestration rate of biogenic carbon. Similarly, the higher N and P excretion rates of zooplankton and the changes in the N:P stoichiometry of the metabolic products will modify the concentration and proportion of N and P in the nutrient pool, inducing quantitative and qualitative changes on primary producers that will translate to the whole Southern Ocean ecosystem.

Evidence of lipofuscin accumulation in the deep-water red shrimp Aristaeomorpha foliacea (Risso, 1827)	MEDITERRANEAN MARINE SCIENCE												Lipofuscin, a non-degradable, degenerative fluorescent pigment which accumulates in post-mitotic cells represents a promising method for ageing marine crustaceans. The presence and accumulation of lipofuscin has been studied in the deep-water red shrimp Aristaeomorpha foliacea (Risso, 1827) to assess its use as a tool for ageing larger (i.e., older) specimens and thus improve knowledge of the growth and longevity of this species. Specimens, gathered during experimental trawl surveys carried out in the Strait of Sicily (Mediterranean Sea), were stored directly on-board in 10% buffered formaldehyde solution; their brain was thereafter removed, prepared with various current histological techniques and examined with a binocular microscope. Thin sections of the olfactory lobe cell mass were also analyzed using fluorescence microscopy, and tire lipofuscin concentration was measured through image analysis. Various indices were computed for each individual by pooling data from many images: number and coverage of the lipofuscin granules per unit area, and mean individual area of the granules. Lipofuscin was detected in all specimens investigated with characteristics (grain typology and dimension) strictly resembling those already described in other crustacean species. The present preliminary results encourage further studies to develop and validate a methodology based on the use of lipofuscin for improving the relative ageing of large A. foliacea shrimps.

J	Nicol, S; Worby, A; Leaper, R				Nicol, Stephen; Worby, Anthony; Leaper, Rebecca			Changes in the Antarctic sea ice ecosystem: potential effects on krill and baleen whales	MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH												The annual formation and loss of some 15 million km(2) of sea ice around the Antarctic significantly affects global ocean circulation, particularly through the formation of dense bottom water. As one of the most profound seasonal changes on Earth, the formation and decay of sea ice plays a major role in climate processes. It is also likely to be impacted by climate change, potentially changing the productivity of the Antarctic region. The sea ice zone supports much wildlife, particularly large vertebrates such as seals, seabirds and whales, some exploited to near extinction. Cetacean species in the Southern Ocean will be directly irnpacted by changes in sea ice patterns as well as indirectly by changes in their principal prey, Antarctic krill, affected by modifications to their own environment through climate change. Understanding how climate change will affect species at all trophic levels in the Southern Ocean requires new approaches and integrated research programs. This review focuses on the current state of knowledge of the sea ice zone and examines the potential for climatic and ecological change in the region. In the context of changes already documented for seals and seabirds, it discusses potential effects on the most conspicuous vertebrate of the region, baleen whales.

The study focused on scattering layers consisting mainly of krill, using a submerged echosounder to resolve individual krill at their daylight depths. Individuals. were tracked for extended periods, and the method was capable of discerning differences in TS and behaviour within seemingly homogenous scattering layers. Krill size increased with depth. This was sometimes, but not always, reflected in TS. The relationship between TS and size broke down when larger krill deeper in the water column were prone to more upward swimming than shallow-living specimens, which reduced TS, but there were also unexplained variations in TS by depth. The variability of TS within the krill tracks was generally high, with deviations routinely exceeding 10 dB, further emphasizing the dependence of krill TS on behaviour. Therefore, although measured values of TS were within the ranges previously reported for krill, it was difficult to apply fixed TS-size relationships. The study underscores the need to determine the impact of behaviour on TS, and shows that appropriate methods to do so are now available.

J	Schmidt, K; Tarling, GA; Plathner, N; Atkinson, A				Schmidt, K; Tarling, GA; Plathner, N; Atkinson, A			Moult cycle-related changes in feeding rates of larval krill Meganyctiphanes norvegica and Thysanoessa spp.	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												Knowledge of crustacean moulting is derived mainly from benthic decapods, which often show profound changes in physiology and behaviour through the moult cycle. In contrast, euphausiids are suggested to be little impaired by moulting, enabling a swarming pelagic life. The aim of this study was to quantify moult cycle-related changes in the feeding activity of 2 euphausiids, Meganyctiphanes norvegica and Thysanoessa spp. Late furcilia larvae and early postlarvae were kept individually over 6 to 7 wk and fed with either a high or low concentration of Artemia salina nauplii or particulate fish food. The intermoult period, similar to9 d for M norvegica and similar to8 d for Thysanoessa spp., increased with body weight, but did not differ with food source. Moulting was partially synchronised, with up to 50 % of the individuals moulting within 48 h of each other. Daily feeding rates on A, salina decreased on the day before moulting, but increased during the next few days with highest values on Days 1 to 3 after moulting. The deviation from the mean feeding rate over the whole moult was more pronounced at the higher food concentration, reaching up to 40 %. Likewise, the defecation volume was reduced on the moulting day and the following day to similar to50 % of the mean, but increased to 180 % of the mean on Day 3 after moulting. Thus, the moult cycle induces significant changes in feeding rates of larval euphausiids with a similar succession of events and intensity as observed in decapods. Feeding rates, extrapolated from spot measurements on a few individuals, are unlikely to represent average values over the whole moult cycle, especially when populations moult synchronously. We propose a protocol to increase the precision of field estimates on feeding rates.																	0171-8630	1616-1599					2004	281						131	143		10.3354/meps281131							WOS:000225543400011						
J	RADTKE, RL; SHEPHERD, BS				RADTKE, RL; SHEPHERD, BS			CURRENT METHODOLOGICAL REFINEMENTS FOR THE ACQUISITION OF LIFE-HISTORY INFORMATION IN FISHES - PARADIGMS FROM PAN-OCEANIC BILLFISHES	COMPARATIVE BIOCHEMISTRY AND PHYSIOLOGY A-MOLECULAR & INTEGRATIVE PHYSIOLOGY												1. Many factors contribute to hinder progress in estimating and verifying age, growth, and life history strategies of billfishes. It is necessary to discern growth of an individual fish to circumvent problems in substantiating age, growth, longevity and age at maturity. These biological characteristics allow us to discover what life history periods are critical to survival and reproduction. 2. Two theoretical approaches may be considered for studying the age of billfish: Age may be delineated in terms of the passage of time (chronological age), or may be examined as the progression of physiological development (physiological age). 3. Hard tissues such as otoliths, spines, vertebrae and post-mitotic tissues contain a plethora of biological and ecological information documenting a fish's chronological and physiological age and individual life history. In calcified tissues, this information can be obtained when the proper techniques are used to investigate the structural and chemical components of billfish hard parts. Chemical analyses of stable isotopes and elemental concentrations in calcified tissues suggest that calcified tissues contain hydrographic, nutritional and migrational information-life history information. 4. Utilization of structural and chemical analyses of billfish otoliths, vertebrae, and other hard parts, enables specific phases of growth to be linked to environmental occurrences. Measurement of the metabolically accumulated cellular pigment, lipofuscin, in post-mitotic tissue may make it possible to define physiological age or readiness. Internal and external structural and chemical analyses of otoliths, vertebrae, and other hard parts, combined with biochemical assays of post-mitotic tissue will greatly enhance studies of life history. The methods presented provide insights into means by which life history knowledge can be obtained.																	1095-6433	1531-4332					1991	100	2					323	333		10.1016/0300-9629(91)90477-T							WOS:A1991GK78200009	1685954

Here we present results from a four-year (2003-2006) numerical simulation using a regional coupled physical-biogeochemical model to assess the Fe sources and transport on the AP shelf and toward the southern Scotia Sea. The model was validated with a suite of data derived from in situ surveys and remote sensing. Model results indicate that sediments in the AP shelf and the South Orkney Plateau (SOP) provide the dominant source of Fe to the upper 500 m in the southern Scotia Sea. Additional Fe inputs to the region are associated with the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) and the northern limb of the Weddell Gyre, deep-ocean sediment sources, dust deposition, and icebergs. Fe on the AP shelf originates primarily from sediments on the relatively shallow inner shelf and is directly injected into the water column and subsequently transported toward Elephant Island by the confluent shelf currents. Off-shelf Fe export is primarily through entrainment of shelf waters by the ACC's Southern Boundary frontal jet along the northern edge of the AP shelf, the Hesperides Trough, and the SOP shelf. About 70% of the off-shelf export takes place below the surface mixed layer, and is subsequently re-supplied to the euphotic zone through vertical mixing, mainly during austral fall and winter. The exported shelf-derived Fe is then advected downstream by the ACC and Weddell Gyre and spread over the southern and eastern Scotia Seas. Taken together, shelf Fe export witin top 500 m meets nearly all of the Fe demand of phytoplankton photosynthesis in the southern Scotia Sea. Waters with elevated Fe concentrations in the Scotia Sea are largely restricted to south of the Southern ACC Front.

Feeding, fasting and foraging success during chick rearing in macaroni penguins	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												Foraging behaviour and energy expenditure were measured continuously throughout the chick-rearing period of free-ranging macaroni penguins Eudyptes chrysolophus. These data were integrated with values obtained from the literature on body mass, assimilation efficiency, body reserve consumption and deposition rates, chick growth and energy expenditure and energy content of food in a new type of algorithm to predict (with 95% confidence limits [CL]) foraging success and daily changes in body mass. A successfully breeding pair of macaroni penguins will capture 111.7 kg (95% CL: 79.4 to 158.0 kg) of prey during the chick-rearing period. The crucial phase of the chick rearing period was around the time that chicks creche, when prey consumption rates more than doubled as the male assisted in foraging and recovered from a long fast. Female macaroni penguins extracted 2.28 (1.60 to 3.26) and males extracted 2.84 (2.02 to 3.99) g of prey from their environment for every minute spent submerged during foraging. Only 15.3 (14.7 to 15.6)% of all prey consumed was fed to chicks. While food capture rates increase in the middle of the breeding season, this may be more a function of greater food availability than a response to demands from their chick. Male and female macaroni penguins have differing breeding strategies with the male showing the characteristics of a capital then income breeder while the female has a strategy that shows characteristics of both capital and income strategies simultaneously. The high synchronicity and precise timing of the macaroni penguin breeding season and timing of the increase in prey capture rates suggest an influx of prey to their foraging area during the middle of the breeding season. A depletion of prey resources in the foraging area used during the breeding season could affect foraging success and have profound effects on the body condition and composition of this species and its ability to raise chicks successfully.

FA not biosynthesized effectively by animals are termed essential fatty acids (EFA). These EFA are important "drivers" of ecosystem health/stability and are therefore highly conserved in aquatic food chains. Aquatic organisms have been and continue to be our primary source of readily available EFA. However, overfishing and our burgeoning population may be acting in concert to threaten our access to this source of EFA. Here, we review the marine FA synthesis/transport cycle and traditional and nontraditional sources of EFA. Our review suggests that, while some traditional sources of marine oils (e.g., tuna) are in steady decline, other sources (e.g., krill) and technologies (e.g., heterotrophic fermentation) hold great promise for maintaining our access to EFA. We provide a minireview which illustrates that EFA contribute to our health and well-being. Finally, there is growing evidence that EFA have been an important force in our past evolution, leading us and others to speculate that an unbroken link exists between EFA, our present health, and, in all likelihood, our continuing evolution.

Nearshore studies have focused on physical mechanisms driving primary production and penguin foraging, but less is known about finer-scale krill distribution and density. We designed two acoustic survey grids paired with conductivity-temperature-depth profiles within adjacent Adelie and gentoo penguin foraging regions near Palmer Station, Antarctica. The grids were sampled from January to March 2019 to assess variability in krill availability and associations with oceanographic properties. Krill density was similar in the two regions, but krill swarms were longer and larger in the gentoo foraging region, which was also less stratified and had lower chlorophyll concentrations. In the inshore zone near penguin colonies, depth-integrated krill density increased from summer to autumn (January-March) independent of chlorophyll concentration, suggesting a life history-driven adult krill migration rather than a resource-driven biomass increase. The daytime depth of krill biomass deepened through the summer and became decoupled from the chlorophyll maximum in March as diel vertical migration magnitude likely increased. Penguins near Palmer Station did not appear to be limited by krill availability during our study, and regional differences in krill depth match the foraging behaviors of the two penguin species. Understanding fine-scale physical forcing and ecological interactions in coastal Antarctic hotspots is critical for predicting how environmental change will impact these ecosystems.				; schofield, oscar/H-4169-2018	Steinberg, Deborah/0000-0001-9884-4655; Nardelli, Schuyler/0000-0001-7926-9018; Fraser, William/0000-0003-4946-1783; schofield, oscar/0000-0003-2359-4131; Conroy, Jack/0000-0001-6559-8240												0024-3590	1939-5590				JUN	2021	66	6					2234	2250		10.1002/lno.11750		MAY 2021					WOS:000646459700001						
J	Quillfeldt, P				Quillfeldt, P			Variation in breeding success in Wilson's storm petrels: influence of environmental factors	ANTARCTIC SCIENCE												The climatic and sea ice conditions of the Southern Ocean are highly variable within and between years, and a better understanding of the influence of climatic conditions on the various parts of the marine food chain is needed. This paper summarizes data on breeding success of a krill-dependent predator, the Wilson's storm petrel Oceanites oceanicus, in a colony on King George Island, South Shetland Islands, Antarctica, over four breeding seasons from 1995/1996 to 1999/2000. The seasons differed greatly in environmental conditions and in the resulting food availability which was reflected in inter- and intra-annual variations in feeding frequency. The breeding success was consequently variable. Starvation, the main cause of chick mortality in three out of four breeding seasons was associated with reduced sea ice cover in winter, which is known to depress food availability in the following breeding season. Food delivery rates also depended on the prevailing winds, which drive the transport of zooplankton-rich water masses. Snowstorms caused additional chick mortality in two out of four seasons when nest burrows became blocked. Implications for the use of Wilson's storm petrels for monitoring of krill are considered.

J	Gorokhova, E; Hansson, S				Gorokhova, E; Hansson, S			Elemental composition of Mysis mixta (Crustacea, Mysidacea) and energy costs of reproduction and embryogenesis under laboratory conditions	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY												Mysis mixta were reared under laboratory conditions (temperature: 9-10 degrees C; salinity: 7 parts per thousand, ad libitum food). Dry weight, ash, total carbon and nitrogen content of mysids (muscle tissue, eggs, and embryos of different developmental stages) have been analyzed. We found significant variations in ash content and elemental composition during growth and maturation for both sexes. The proportion of carbon in abdominal muscle decreased gradually from juveniles with body weight of 3-4 mg (42.9%) to males and gravid females ( similar to 40.0%). The nitrogen content was relatively constant (11.4% in average) with significant differences only between juveniles (11.3%) and mature females (11.6%). In embryos, carbon and nitrogen content were highest in early stages (58.6 and 14.3%, respectively). By the end of the marsupial development, carbon had decreased to 51.4% and nitrogen to 12.6%. The C:N ratio reflected the change in somatic carbon content, and the ratio decreased 6.2% from juveniles to gravid females, indicating lipids to be an energy source during maturation and reproduction. The weight-specific female investment in reproduction increases with body size. In gravid females, intersegmental growth during brooding period was observed, while males appear to store energy only for copulation and die after mating. Ontogenetic variation in body composition has implications for elemental budgets of M. mixta, its value as prey for fish and in modeling energy and nutrient cycling. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

TROPHIC RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN PHAEOCYSTIS AND ZOOPLANKTON - AN ASSESSMENT OF METHODS AND SIZE DEPENDENCE	JOURNAL OF PLANKTON RESEARCH												A laboratory study was conducted using natural populations of Phaeocystis pouchetii and co-occurring crustacean zooplankton from northern Norwegian fjords. Phytoplankton communities dominated by colonial and solitary cells of Phaeocystis were incubated with added zooplankton spanning five orders of magnitude in biomass. including the euphausiids Thysanoessa spp. and the calanoid copepods Calantis hyperboreus Kroyer (CV), C.finmarchicus Gunnerus (CIV-V) and Acartia longiremis Liljeborg (adult females). Grazing was determined from changes in concentrations of four size classes of chlorophyll a. Phaeocystis cells and colonies. These were compared to zooplankton grazing on cultured and naturally occurring diatoms. Clearance and optimum prey size range were both proportional to grazer size. Diatoms were grazed more than Phaeocystis by euphausiids and A. longiremis. Comparison of clearance estimated from colony disappearance to those from changes in chlorophyll a and Phaeocystis cell number indicated that the feeding/swimming activities of Thysanoessa spp. and Calanus spp. resulted in fragmentation of colonies into smaller size classes. In particular, Thysanoessa spp. redistributed and consumed colonies in the size range >500-20 mum, Calanus spp. redistributed and grazed those <500 mum. and A.longiremis did not graze or break Phaeocystis. The colony breakage by Thysanoessa spp. resulted in increases in Phaeocystis cells in the <20 mum size fractions relative to controls. Measurements of Phaeocystis cell abundance and size using an image-analysis system showed distinct differences in cell size between colony cells and solitary cells, which provided further evidence of colony disruption independent of ingestion. The data indicate that changes in colony abundance are an inadequate methodological tool and that multiple techniques are required to assess the trophic importance of Phaeocystis in zooplankton diets. Moreover, the role of Phaeocystis in planktonic food webs is highly dependent upon a continual match between the size structure of Phaeocystis populations and the collection efficiency of co-occurring zooplankton.

Intermolt period (IMP) was derived from the molting rate method in order to estimate the DGRs. Mean IMP was 9.2 +/- 4.8 days (range: 2.9-18.7 d). Overall mean DGR was 0.03 +/- 0.13 mm d(-1). DGR showed a dome-shaped pattern, with a higher mean DGR when upwelling was moderate (0.06 +/- 0.04 mm d(-1)) than intense (0.01 +/- 0.00 mm d(-1)) or weak (0.01 +/- 0.01 mm d(-1)). This dome-shaped trend was observed in chlorophyll-a concentrations (Chla) at similar upwelling regimens. E. mucronata DGR variability was best explained by a generalized linear model which included the contribution of the Equatorial Subsurface Water, temperature, dissolved oxygen and Chla as predictor variables. Results suggest that E. mucronata is better adapted to grow under upwelling conditions when it can take advantage of high biological productivity, although the species growth is not limited when weak upwelling or even downwelling occurs. Analysis of the duration of the upwelling events suggest that E. mucronata growth is limited (shrinking) when upwellings last >10 days. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Acoustic survey for marine mammal occurrence and distribution off East Antarctica (30-80 degrees E) in January-February 2006	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY												A large scale, systematic, acoustic survey for whales and seals in eastern Antarctic waters was conducted in January-February 2006. During the BROKE-West survey of Southern Ocean waters between 30 and 80 degrees E longitude, an acoustic survey was conducted to complement a traditional visual survey for marine mammal occurrence and distribution. As part of the survey, 145 DIFAR sonobuoys were deployed every 30' of latitude on north-south transects, and prior to CTD stations on the initial east-west transect. Underwater sound was analyzed for 70 minute samples from each sonobuoy. Blue whales were the most commonly recorded species, identified at 55 of the sonobuoy deployment sites. Other species recorded include: sperm (46 sites), fin (14), humpback (2), and sei (3) whales, and leopard (11) and Ross (17) seals. Large numbers of blue and sperm whales, and all Ross seals were detected on the westernmost two transects, which were the only transects of the survey with relatively extensive sea ice remaining off the continental shelf. Large numbers of blue whales were also detected in the more eastern waters of the survey off the Prydz Bay region, while two detections of pygmy blue whales represent the farthest south these whales have been recorded. Of the relatively few fin whale detections, most occurred in more northerly waters. Fin whale vocalizations from this region were distinctly different than those recorded elsewhere around Antarctica suggesting acoustic recordings may be useful to delineate regional or stock boundaries of this species. Previously undescribed sounds were attributed to Ross seals. Acoustic detections of these and leopard seal sounds indicate these animals venture further from their traditionally described distributions, with vocalizing leopard seals occurring much further north than might be expected. Overall, the results of the sonobuoy survey provide a measure of each species' relative spatial distribution over the survey area based on acoustic detections, and when combined with the results of the visual survey, will provide a comprehensive view of marine mammal distribution throughout the region during the BROKE-West survey.

Echoes from krill were identified using the theoretical difference in echo intensity at 300 and 125 kHz and scaled to krill density using target strengths appropriate for krill in the region: krill size was determined from diet samples from furseals and penguins foraging near the moorings. A method using water flow past the moorings was developed to convert time-based acoustic observations of krill to area-based abundance estimates. Flow past the stationary moorings was treated analogously to motion along-track of a research vessel through a nominally stationary body of water during a conventional survey. The moorings thus provide a Eulerian view of variation in krill abundance. This is ecologically instructive for South Georgia, where krill are generally passive drifters on currents and where temporal fluctuations in abundance have significant consequences for krill-dependent predators. Moorings were positioned on routine research vessel survey transects, and validity of the mooring method was assessed by comparison of mooring and vessel observations. Krill density estimates from the moorings were not statistically different from vessel estimates in adjacent time periods. A time series of krill density from a mooring revealed step-changes that were not seen during short-term vessel surveys. Moorings deliver data over time scales that cannot be achieved from research vessels and provide insight on environmental factors associated with variation in krill abundance at South Georgia. Mooring data may aid ecosystem-based management.

We examined the diet and foraging dynamics of breeding macaroni penguins Eudyptes chrysolophus from sub-Antarctic Heard Island and related these to prey distributions derived from active-acoustics and net-derived data in the foraging zone of the penguins. Consistent with previous findings, we found that penguin diets changed between the guard and creche stages of the breeding cycle and that this change in diet corresponded with a switch from short foraging trips in the guard stage to significantly longer, offshore foraging trips in the creche stage. We related these differences in diet and foraging to characteristics of the prey field-specifically, a relatively uniform distribution of krill over the shelf and in deeper, offshore waters, compared with an increasing abundance of fish further from shore. We developed a simple dynamic energy budget for macaroni penguins to explore whether targeting fish during the creche stage was an energetically favourable strategy. Finally, we extrapolated our energy budget to estimate prey consumption at the colony scale as previous work has suggested that depletion near breeding colonies could contribute to prey switching. We found that prey switching during the creche stage was energetically favourable and was most likely related to a reduction in foraging constraints, rather than prey depletion. This study shows the value of integrating data sets to address questions surrounding variation in diet and the use of alternative prey by marine predators.

During the breeding period, proximity to suitable feeding sites is essential for central place foragers, whereas during the non-breeding period their distribution is relatively unconstrained. We combined light-based geolocation and satellite tracking to investigate seasonal variation in foraging grounds and behaviour of white-chinned petrels from Kerguelen Island. Birds were associated with highly productive areas throughout the year. During breeding (summer), they performed long commuting trips from the colony to distant, productive Antarctic waters. Thereafter, birds migrated 5200 km westwards to the Benguela upwelling system off Namibia and South Africa to spend the winter. This seasonal shift of foraging grounds coincides with a change in activity patterns; much less time was spent in flight in winter than in summer. Individual variability in the locations of foraging zones and seasonal/daily activity patterns was low. Trip durations were shorter during chick-rearing than incubation, although birds often travelled as far or farther, tracking the gradual break up of pack ice. Habitat use models revealed an association with distance to sea-ice edge and chlorophyll a gradient during incubation, whereas sea surface temperature and chlorophyll a gradient best explained habitat use during chick rearing. White-chinned petrels are likely to overlap with other marine predators and fisheries throughout the year. Fishery bycatch constitutes the most significant direct threat to petrels at sea. Moreover, future climate-induced reductions in productivity could affect birds year-round.

Biochemical zonation	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART I-OCEANOGRAPHIC RESEARCH PAPERS												The composition, biomass, distribution and grazing impact of dominant components of the meso- and macrozooplankton community were investigated along a transect occupied in the Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean during the second cruise of the South African Antarctic Ecosystem Study conducted in late austral summer (Jan.-Feb.) 1993. Total zooplankton abundance along the transect ranged from 6 to 161 ind. m(-3), and biomass levels ranged from 4. 2 to 80.5 mg DWt m(-3). Elevated abundances and biomass were recorded at stations occupied in the vicinity of the Marginal Ice Zone (MIZ), the Antarctic Polar Front (APF) and Subantarctic Front (SAF). Throughout the investigation mesozooplankton, comprising mainly copepods, dominated numerically and by biomass accounting for > 80% of the total. South of the APF, the copepods Calanus propinquus, Calanoides acutus and Metridia gerlachei numerically dominated zooplankton counts, while north of the front the zooplankton community was dominated by the copepods Calanus simillimus, Rhincalanus gigas and Lucicutia ovalis. Grazing impact of the six most abundant zooplankton taxa, accounting for up to 90% of all zooplankton counted at each station, demonstrated large spatial variability ranging from 0.01 to 18% of the chlorophyll (chl-n) standing stock or up to 89% of the daily phytoplankton production (DPP). The highest grazing impact along the transect was recorded within the Polar Front Zone where zooplankton removed between 4 and 18% of the chl-a standing stock or between 53 and 89% of DPP daily. Outside this region, zooplankton grazing generally corresponded to < 5% of the integrated chl-a or < 20% of the daily DPP. The implications of the spatial differences in grazing impact on the efficiency of the biological pump are discussed. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

Primary production throughout austral fall, during a time of decreasing daylength in the western Antarctic Peninsula	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												Antarctic phytoplankton is characterized by a pronounced seasonality in abundance, driven mainly by changes in sunlight. We combined measurements and modeling to describe the influence of changing daylength on fall and winter phytoplankton production in coastal waters of the western Antarctic Peninsula (wAP) in 2001 and 2002. The model was parameterized with field observations from the Palmer Long-Term Ecological program in the wAP during summer and early fall and from the Southern Ocean Global Ecosystems Dynamics program fall and winter cruises to Marguerite Bay and shelf waters. Shorter daylength and a deepening of the mixed layer account for most of the decrease in primary production during March, April, and May. At this time, biomass decreases by an order of magnitude and remains low and constant until the end of August. An additional loss rate was added to the primary production model to fit output to observations. This loss rate, estimated at similar to 0.1 to 0.15 d(-1), is due to physical, chemical, and biological processes such as scavenging by sea ice, zooplankton grazing, cell lysis, and cell sedimentation, which are expected to be high at this time of year. Growth and loss rates of phytoplankton populations are similar on 1 March, with growth decreasing rapidly over time while the loss rates remain constant. By the beginning of winter (1 June), growth is low, with minimum rates in July and increasing towards September. During a period of diminishing food supply, preliminary estimates of grazing indicate that fall biomass could support existing macrozooplankton populations, but the timing and concentration of food supply is variable and expected to affect health of zooplankton as they enter the winter.

J	Sovik, SL; Rustad, T				Sovik, SL; Rustad, T			Effect of season and fishing ground on the activity of cathepsin B and collagenase in by-products from cod species	LWT-FOOD SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												Cathepsin B and collagenase are important enzymes in the quality-deteriorating processes of fish products. Fish by-products are the left-overs after preparation of the main product and are highly perishable fractions of the fish. They do, however, contain high-quality protein with a potential for utilization. This study characterizes the activity of cathepsins B and collagenase in by-products from five species of cod caught in different fishing grounds and in different seasons. Mean maximum cathepsin B activity was measured at 35 degrees C in the viscera and the liver, and 50 degrees C in cut off, while collagenase showed mean maximum activity at 20 degrees C in cut off, 35 degrees C in liver and 50 degrees C in viscera. Species, season and fishing ground significantly affected activity of cathepsin B and collagenase in cut off samples, while viscera samples were not significantly affected. Cathepsin B was more heat stable than collagenase in all three fractions. Both cathepsin B and collagenase from cut off were less heat stable than the corresponding enzymes from the other two fractions. (c) 2004 Swiss Society of Food Science and Technology.

J	Alonzo, SH; Switzer, PV; Mangel, M				Alonzo, SH; Switzer, PV; Mangel, M			An ecosystem-based approach to management: using individual behaviour to predict the indirect effects of Antarctic krill fisheries on penguin foraging	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY												1. Changes in species' abundance and distributions caused by human disturbances can have indirect effects on other species in a community. Although ecosystem approaches to management are becoming increasingly prevalent, they require a fuller understanding of how individual behaviour determines interactions within and between species. 2. Ecological interactions involving krill are of major importance to many species within the Antarctic. Despite extensive knowledge of the ecosystem that they occupy, there is still incomplete understanding of the links between species and the effect of environmental conditions on these interactions. In this study, we extended a behavioural model used previously to understand the interactions between penguins and krill to determine the indirect effect of krill fisheries on penguin foraging success and behaviour in adjacent breeding sites. 3. Increased fishing pressure offshore is predicted to reduce penguin food intake. Given the documented links between krill and penguins, this also leads to a prediction of decreased penguin survival and reproduction. Krill behaviour is predicted to cause stronger effects of krill fisheries than explained solely by the percentage of biomass removed. Environmental conditions that decrease krill growth rates or cause krill to spend time in deeper water are also predicted to increase the magnitude of the effect of fishing on penguin success. We show that changes in penguin foraging behaviour can be used to assess the impact of local fisheries on penguin reproductive success. 4. Synthesis and applications. These results demonstrate that an understanding of predator-prey interactions, indirect effects between species, and individual behaviour is imperative to our ability to manage populations. We describe a general method to use what is known about ecological and evolutionary processes with species-specific information to predict the response of organisms to novel situations. We further show how individual behaviour can be used to assess the impact of human disturbance on ecosystems.																	0021-8901					AUG	2003	40	4					692	702		10.1046/j.1365-2664.2003.00830.x							WOS:000184109200009						
J	Onsrud, MSR; Kaartvedt, S				Onsrud, MSR; Kaartvedt, S			Diel vertical migration of the krill Meganyctiphanes norvegica in relation to physical environment, food and predators	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												Acoustic scattering layers of Meganyctiphanes norvegica in the Oslofjord, Norway, typically stayed below similar to 70 m during the day. They remained below prevailing fish schools, though varying numbers of deep-living fish occurred among the krill. The estimated light intensity at the top of the krill layer varied between 4.6 x 10(-6) and 2.3 x 10(-4) mu mol m(-2) s(-1). M, norvegica followed isolumes during ascent at dusk, but upward migration was mainly arrested at similar to 10-30 m and the krill were scattered throughout the water column at night. The minimum depth was not related to seasonal light levels, chlorophyll concentration or the pycnocline. Fish schools dispersed at sunset, and fish invaded the krill layer at night. Nocturnal avoidance of the surface water may thus have been an antipredator response. Herbivorous feeding was strongly related to abundance of algae (chl a levels). Feeding on phytoplankton increased at night, but daytime stomach pigment content was high during spring, when sedimenting phytoplankton appeared to represent a deep food source. Feeding on copepods was evident both day and night, with no consistent relation between copepod remains in the stomachs and integrated abundance of copepods in the water column. M. norvegica carried out diel vertical migrations irrespective of fluctuations in distribution and abundance of food resources.																	0171-8630						1998	171						209	219		10.3354/meps171209							WOS:000076561600018

Autotrophic algal populations were composed almost entirely of diatoms followed by phytoflagellates such as autotrophic dinoflagellates and cryptophytes. Among the microbial community, heterotrophic biomass was dominated by heterotrophic dinoflagellates and naked ciliates and finally exceeded autotrophic biomass. Qualitative microscopic analysis revealed that heterotrophic dinoflagellates were ingesting large number of diatoms. Synchronizing fluctuation of naked ciliates with phytoflagellates suggested a predator-prey relationship between them. Our results suggest that the pelagic food webs under the extensive ice-covered areas in coastal Antarctic regions are not short but complex.																	0722-4060	1432-2056				SEP	2007	30	10					1285	1293		10.1007/s00300-007-0289-8							WOS:000248812800009

Distribution of Phaeocystis antarctica-dominated sea ice algal communities and their potential to seed phytoplankton across the western Antarctic Peninsula in spring	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												The western Antarctic Peninsula has experienced extreme changes in the timing of sea ice melt and freeze up, shortening the duration of the seasonal sea ice cycle. While previous research demonstrated connections between multiple pelagic trophic levels and the physics of the sea ice, few studies have assessed the sea ice ecosystem or its linkage to the ocean ecosystem in this region. Through a field survey and shipboard experiments, our study focused on characterizing the spring ice algal bloom and elucidating its role in seeding phytoplankton communities postice melt in high and low light conditions. Field data revealed that algal communities in slush layers, often formed from the flooding of seawater (infiltration layers), dominated biomass distributions in the sea ice throughout the region, and showed distinct photophysiological characteristics from interior or bottom ice communities. Sea ice algal biomass reached 120 mg chl a m(-2) and was often dominated by Phaeocystis antarctica. Shipboard growth experiments showed that prior light history (ice or water column), rather than community composition (phytoplankton and ice algae were composed of similar taxa), primarily drove physiological responses to high and low light. P. antarctica generally dominated the community in growth experiments at the end of the 6 d incubation period. Settling column experiments suggested that P. antarctica's higher sinking rates relative to other taxa may explain its minor contributions to the summer phytoplankton community in single-cell form and its absence in colonial form, observed in the long-term ecological record of this region.

Feeding behavior of the ctenophore Thalassocalyce inconstans: revision of anatomy of the order Thalassocalycida	MARINE BIOLOGY												Behavioral observations using a remotely operated vehicle (ROV) in the Gulf of California in March, 2003, provided insights into the vertical distribution, feeding and anatomy of the rare and delicate ctenophore Thalassocalyce inconstans. Additional archived ROV video records from the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute of 288 sightings of T. inconstans and 2,437 individual observations of euphausiids in the Gulf of California and Monterey Canyon between 1989 and 2005 were examined to determine ctenophore and euphausiid prey depth distributions with respect to temperature and dissolved oxygen concentration [dO]. In the Gulf of California most ctenophores (96.9%) were above 350 m, the top of the oxygen minimum layer. In Monterey Canyon the ctenophores were more widely distributed throughout the water column, including the hypoxic zone, to depths as great as 3,500 m. Computer-aided behavioral analysis of two video records of the capture of euphausiids by T. inconstans showed that the ctenophore contracted its bell almost instantly (0.5 s), transforming its flattened, hemispherical resting shape into a closed bi-lobed globe in which seawater and prey were engulfed. Euphausiids entrapped within the globe displayed a previously undescribed escape response for krill ('probing behavior'), in which they hovered and gently probed the inner surfaces of the globe with antennae without stimulating further contraction by the ctenophore. Such rapid bell contraction could be effected only by a peripheral sphincter muscle even though the presence of circumferential ring musculature was unknown for the Phylum Ctenophora. Thereafter, several live T. inconstans were collected by hand off Barbados and microscopic observations confirmed that assumption.																	0025-3162					APR	2009	156	5					1049	1056		10.1007/s00227-009-1149-6							WOS:000263829900020

Roy			Extreme anomalous atmospheric circulation in the West Antarctic Peninsula region in Austral Spring and Summer 2001/02, and its profound impact on sea ice and biota	JOURNAL OF CLIMATE												Exceptional sea ice conditions occurred in the West Antarctic Peninsula (WAP) region from September 2001 to February 2002, resulting from a strongly positive atmospheric pressure anomaly in the South Atlantic coupled with strong negative anomalies in the Bellingshausen - Amundsen and southwest Weddell Seas. This created a strong and persistent north-northwesterly flow of mild and moist air across the WAP. In situ, satellite, and NCEP - NCAR Reanalysis (NNR) data are used to examine the profound and complex impact on regional sea ice, oceanography, and biota. Extensive sea ice melt, leading to an ocean mixed layer freshening and widespread ice surface flooding, snow - ice formation, and phytoplankton growth, coincided with extreme ice deformation and dynamic thickening. Sea ice dynamics were crucial to the development of an unusually early and rapid ( short) retreat season ( negative ice extent anomaly). Strong winds with a dominant northerly component created an unusually compact marginal ice zone and a major increase in ice thickness by deformation and over-rafting. This led to the atypical persistence of highly compact coastal ice through summer. Ecological effects were both positive and negative, the latter including an impact on the growth rate of larval Antarctic krill and the largest recorded between-season breeding population decrease and lowest reproductive success in a 30-yr Adelie penguin demographic time series. The unusual sea ice and snow cover conditions also contributed to the formation of a major phytoplankton bloom. Unexpectedly, the initial bloom occurred within compact sea ice and could not be detected in Sea-Viewing Wide Field-of-View Sensor (SeaWiFS) ocean color data. This analysis demonstrates that sea ice extent alone is an inadequate descriptor of the regional sea ice state/conditions, from both a climatic and ecological perspective; further information is required on thickness and dynamics/deformation.

Chlorophyll a concentrations during the incubations ranged between 0.187 and 1.410 mu g l(-1) and were dominated by ice-associated chain-forming microphytoplankton (>20 mu m) of the genera Nitzschia and Chaetoceros. The microplankton assemblages were entirely dominated by protozoans comprised of ciliates and dinoflagellates. Densities of protozoans ranged from 1375 to 2690 cells l(-1) Based on previously published results, meso- and macrozooplankton species generally consumed >120% of their minimum daily ration, i.e. minimum carbon uptake (MCU), when offered microplankton. Exceptions were Euphausia crystallorophias and Vibilia antarctica for which microplankton carbon contributed 68 and 30% of MCU, respectively. Microplankton carbon contributed between 17 and 24% of the total carbon requirements for the 4 copepod species examined and between 21 and 73% for the macrozooplankton. The daily rations of juveniles were, however, twice those of the adults,suggesting that the relative importance of microzooplankton to the daily ration of macrozooplankton shifts with life stage. Carnivory by metazoan grazers may, therefore, potentially reduce the high grazing impact of microzooplankton on the local phytoplankton stock.

Interaction of warm acclimation, low salinity, and trophic fluoride on plasmatic constituents of the Antarctic fish Notothenia rossii Richardson, 1844	FISH PHYSIOLOGY AND BIOCHEMISTRY												The adaptive evolution of the Notothenia rossii occurred under the selective pressure of stable and low temperatures. It is an opportunistic feeder of Antarctic krill and the fluoride in the krill carapace is apparently not toxic. We investigated the interactive effect of fluoride, elevated temperatures, and low salinity on the plasmatic constituents of this Antarctic fish. The experiments were conducted at the Brazilian Antarctic Station Comandante Ferraz (EACF), located on King George Island. The Antarctic fish N. rossii was acclimatized to eight thermo-saline-trophic conditions, combining two temperatures (0 and 4 A degrees C), two salinities (35 and 20), and two trophic conditions (with/without fluoride) for an 11-day period. Trophic fluoride was not able to alter the plasmatic levels of glucose, cholesterol, plasmatic protein, Cl-, Mg2+, Ca2+, and inorganic phosphate, but induced an acute elevation of triglycerides at 0 A degrees C and salinity of 35. At low salinity, hyperglycemia, hypertriglyceridemia, and hypocalcemia were observed. The thermo-saline interaction at 4 A degrees C was able to minimize the effects of fluoride and low salinity on the plasmatic constituents levels.

Volume backscattering was measured in the Gulf of Maine at 43, 120, 200, and 420 kHz. Zooplankton composition and size were determined using net and video sampling techniques, and water properties were determined using conductivity, temperature, and depth sensors. Dominant scatterers have been identified using recently developed scattering models for zooplankton and microstructure. Microstructure generally did not contribute to the scattering. At certain locations, gas-bearing zooplankton, that account for a small fraction of the total abundance and biomass, dominated the scattering at all frequencies. At these locations, acoustically inferred size agreed well with size determined from the net samples. Significant differences between the acoustic, net, and video estimates of abundance for these zooplankton are most likely due to limitations of the net and video techniques. No other type of biological scatterer ever dominated the scattering at all frequencies. Copepods, fluid-like zooplankton that account for most of the abundance and biomass, dominated at select locations only at the highest frequencies. At these locations, acoustically inferred abundance agreed well with net and video estimates.

William			Developmental and spatial variations in the diet signatures of hyperbenthic shrimp Nauticaris marionis at the Prince Edward Islands based on stable isotope ratios and fatty acid profiles	CONTINENTAL SHELF RESEARCH												The caridean shrimp Nauticaris marionis is an ecologically important species in the benthic community around the sub-Antarctic Prince Edward Islands (PEI) as it represents a key prey item for a variety of top predators breeding on the islands. We hypothesized that the diet of N. marionis shifts during its development, and that spatial variability in food availability results in differentiation in the diet signatures of specimens collected from various locations of the shelf waters around the PEI. Specimens were collected from nine stations (depth range 70 to 240 m) around the PEI at inter-island shelf (from west to east: upstream, between and downstream) and nearshore regions during austral autumn 2009. Stable isotope and fatty acid data both revealed spatial and developmental variations in the shrimp diet. Nearshore shrimp were more C-13-enriched than those from the inter-island region, suggesting increased kelp detritus entered the food web in the nearshore regions. The shrimp showed increases in delta C-13 and delta N-15 signatures (and trophic position) with an increase in body size, resulting in distinctions between size classes that reflected shifts in their trophic niche through development. The fatty acid profiles similarly indicated distinctions in diet with increased shrimp size (in the deep regions), and spatial variability was evident in relation to region and depth. All shrimp contained large proportions of polyunsaturated and essential fatty acids, indicating that the quality of food consumed was similar between regions despite the diet variability. Our results provide new dietary information about a key species operating near the base of the food web at the highly productive PEI, and show that there were no areas of enhanced nutrition available to the shrimp. As such, there was no nutritional advantage to shrimp inhabiting any specific region around the PEI. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Garzio, LM; Steinberg, DK				Garzio, Lori M.; Steinberg, Deborah K.			Microzooplankton community composition along the Western Antarctic Peninsula	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART I-OCEANOGRAPHIC RESEARCH PAPERS												Microzooplankton are an integral part of aquatic food webs, yet compared to macrozooplankton, are understudied in the Southern Ocean. The region along the Western Antarctic Peninsula (WAP) is experiencing rapid climate warming, resulting in declines in sea ice extent and duration, and affecting the marine food web. Microzooplankton community structure along the WAP was analyzed in January 2010 and 2011 as part of the Palmer Antarctica Long-Term Ecological Research project. Whole seawater samples were collected within the top 100 m of the water column along both north-south and coastal-offshore gradients, and major taxa of microzooplankton were quantified using microscopy. Average chlorophyll-a concentrations and microzooplankton biomass were higher in 2011 compared to 2010. Athecate dinoflagellates and aloricate ciliates dominated microzooplankton biomass, and the biomass of most taxonomic groups was higher in the south compared to the north. Specifically, aloricate ciliate and tintinnid biomass increased with increasing latitude, and biomass peaked at several southern, inshore stations - including Marguerite Bay, which was an area of high biomass for some microzooplankton taxa. Biomass was higher in surface waters compared to 100 m, and variability in microzooplankton biomass between years and with distance from shore was most likely due to sea ice dynamics. Microzooplankton biomass was positively correlated with chlorophyll-a and particulate organic carbon.

The inclusion of krill meal increased the body weight and size and decreased the peri-visceral fat and visceral weight indices. The astaxanthin diet produced the highest accumulation of total carotenoids in the fillet compared to the krill meal diet: the difference was significant after 15 days of feeding (2.50 vs 2.10 mg/kg) till the end of the trial (5.00 vs 4.80 mg/kg). The same pattern was observed for astaxanthin concentration with the highest values in the fillets of fish fed the astaxanthin diet. Fillet lightness (L*) was not affected by trout diets whereas redness (a*) and yellowness (b*) were significantly higher in fish fed the astaxanthin diet until day 30 of the trial. Hue was not affected by feeding, whereas chroma was significantly higher in the fish fed astaxanthin throughout the trial except on day 45 of sampling. Trout fed the krill meal diet had a paler pink-red colour on the SalmoFan scale than those receiving the astaxanthin diet. No significant differences emerged in proximate composition and cholesterol content of trout in the two groups. The fatty acid profile of the fillets reflected the fatty acids of the diets administered to the trout: eicosapentaenoic, docosahexaenoic and docosapentaenoic acids and total n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids were significantly higher in the fish fed the krill meal.

Fatty acids of the three major lipid classes, polar lipids (PL), triacylglycerol (TAG), and wax esters (WE), were analyzed to highlight ontogenic changes in their diet and metabolism. The PL composition of T. libellula did not show any strong variations along their growth except during the first month where an important increase of 20:5(n-3) (EPA) and 22:6(n-3) (DHA) was observed. The TAG composition revealed a clear gradient corresponding to a diet shift from omnivorous juveniles toward carnivorous sub-adults and adults. Indeed, fatty acid trophic markers of diatoms were dominant in the juveniles, whereas 20:1(n-9) and 22:1(n-11), the Calanus sp. trophic markers, overwhelmed in the older stages. The WE composition highlighted the same general trend, however, differences were found with the TAG and are discussed as a result of differences in turnover rates and assimilation pathways between the two lipid classes.

In our study, after a 14-day acclimation period, 50 female Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly assigned to five groups, each of which was fed a different diet, for 28 days. We then evaluated the effect of krill protein complex (KPC), krill powder, and defatted krill powder on the nitrogen balance, growth, and antioxidant activity through analyses of MDA, CAT, GSH-Px, and T-SOD. An in vivo analysis suggested that the nitrogen retention rate, protein digestibility, and bioutilization of krill products were equal to those of casein. Moreover, the KPC diet resulted in the highest nitrogen intake and retention among the groups, and the biological value and net protein utilization obtained with KPC were higher than those obtained with defatted krill powder, which was consistent with the weight gains observed for these two groups. The hematological test also showed that KPC contributed to the production of functional proteins in the body. The antioxidant activity analysis indicated that higher GSH-Px and T-SOD activities were obtained with krill products and KPC, respectively, compared with casein. The results from this study suggested that krill proteins could promote growth and improve the antioxidant status of an organism. Although further studies on the safety of krill products for human consumption are needed, this work provides insights into the use of krill proteins as a potential substitute for other proteins and restructured foods.

J	MCCLATCHIE, S				MCCLATCHIE, S			TIME-SERIES MEASUREMENT OF GRAZING RATES OF ZOOPLANKTON AND BIVALVES	JOURNAL OF PLANKTON RESEARCH												The current state of the art in automated measurement of grazing rates of zooplankton and bivalves is evaluated. Limitations,to the development of automated methods are discussed with reference to theoretical considerations. Different approaches to time-series measurements are examined, and some inadequately investigated time scales for measurement of grazing rates are outlined. Levels of automation of existing experimental systems are described, and a recently developed grazing system based on in vivo fluorescence advanced. The new system is suited to use with zooplankton or bivalves, but depends on precise calibration of in vivo fluorescence. It facilitates rapid measurement of functional response to food concentration, estimation of time-series rates at constant food concentrations, and measurement of rates while simulating patchy food distribution. Results derived from experiments with krill (Nyctiphanes australis) and cockles (Chione stutchburyi) using this grazing system are presented, and some future directions for instrument development suggested.																	0142-7873					FEB	1992	14	2					183	200		10.1093/plankt/14.2.183							WOS:A1992HD36600001

Antarctic sea ice change and variability - Physical and ecological implications	POLAR SCIENCE												Although Antarctic sea ice is undergoing a slight increase in overall extent, major regional changes are occurring in its spatio-temporal characteristics (most notably in sea ice seasonality). Biologically significant aspects of Antarctic sea ice are evaluated, emphasising the importance of scale and thermodynamics versus dynamics. Changing sea ice coverage is having major direct and indirect though regionally-dependent effects on ecosystem structure and function, with the most dramatic known effects to date occurring in the West Antarctic Peninsula region. There is mounting evidence that loss of sea ice has affected multiple levels of the marine food web in a complex fashion and has triggered cascading effects. Impacts on primary production, Antarctic krill, fish, marine mammals and birds are assessed, and are both negative and positive. The review includes recent analysis of change/variability in polynyas and fast ice, and also highlights the significance of extreme events (which have paradoxical impacts). Possible future scenarios are investigated in the light of the predicted decline in sea ice by 2100 e.g. increased storminess/waviness, numbers of icebergs and snowfall. Our current lack of knowledge on many aspects of sea ice-related change and biological response is emphasised. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. and NIPR. All rights reserved.

J	Mori, M; Butterworth, DS				Mori, M.; Butterworth, D. S.			A first step towards modelling the krill-predator dynamics of the Antarctic ecosystem	CCAMLR SCIENCE												The history of human harvests of seals, whales, fish and krill in the Antarctic is summarised briefly, and the central role played by krill emphasised. The background to the hypothesis of a krill surplus in the mid-20th century is described, and the information on population and trend levels that has become available since the postulate was first advanced is discussed. The objective of the study is to determine whether predator-prey interactions alone can broadly explain observed population trends without the need for recourse to environmental change hypotheses. A model is developed including krill, four baleen whale (blue, fin, humpback and minke) and two seal (Antarctic fur and crabeater) species. The model commences in 1780 (the onset of fur seal harvests) and distinguishes the Atlantic/Indian and Pacific Ocean sectors of the Southern Ocean in view of the much larger past harvests in the former. A reference case and six sensitivities are fitted to available data on predator abundances and trends, and the plausibility of the results and the assumptions on which they are based is discussed, together with suggested further areas for investigation. Amongst the key inferences of the study are that: (i) species interaction effects alone can explain observed predator abundance trends, though not without some difficulty; (ii) it is necessary to consider other species, in addition to baleen whales and krill, to explain observed trends - crabeater seals seemingly play an important role and constitute a particular priority for improved abundance and trend information; (iii) the Atlantic/Indian Ocean sector shows major changes in species abundances, in contrast to the Pacific Ocean sector, which is much more stable; (iv) baleen whales have to be able to achieve relatively high growth rates to explain observed trends; and (v) Laws' (1977) estimate of some 150 million tonnes for the krill surplus may be appreciably too high as a result of his calculations omitting consideration of density-dependent effects in feeding rates.																	1023-4063						2006	13						217	277									WOS:000242336000012						
J	Chiba, S; Ishimaru, T; Hosie, GW; Fukuchi, M				Chiba, S; Ishimaru, T; Hosie, GW; Fukuchi, M			Spatio-temporal variability of zooplankton community structure off east Antarctica (90 to 160 degrees E)	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												Spatio-temporal variability of zooplankton community structure off east Antarctica (90 to 160 degrees E) was studied from 1988 to 1996 based on samples collected by the Japanese icebreaker 'Shirase', Three community groups with distinctive species compositions were obtained by cluster analysis. Group 1 was defined as the 'Subantarctic community' because it appeared exclusively north of the Polar Front, and indicator species of the group included Eucalanus longiceps and Limacina retroversa, which are typical subantarctic species. Groups 2a and 2b occurred in the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC), and are thus defined as the 'ACC communities'. All indicator species for Group 2b, including large copepods, Calanoides acutus, Calanus propinquus and Metridia gerlachei, were also common indicators for Group 2a. In Group 2a, smaller copepods (small calanoids, cyclopoids and poecilostomatoids) and non-copepod herbivores were also indicators. Total abundance was markedly high in Group 2a, and copepods numerically dominated all 3 groups (>70% in Group 1, >80 % in 2a, >90 % in 2b). The longitudinal distribution pattern of Groups 2a and 2b varied between years, although they occurred along the same latitude. Multiple-regression analysis on environmental variables and distribution of the groups demonstrated that Group 2a tended to occur in relatively warm water masses with high chlorophyll a and low silicate concentrations. While Group 2b occurred in colder areas with low chlorophyll a concentrations, the results of this study suggest that the occasional intrusion of northern water further south caused by meandering of the ACC might have been responsible for the observed distribution patterns of the zooplankton community.																	0171-8630						2001	216						95	108		10.3354/meps216095							WOS:000170395500008

The contribution of ice algae to the winter energy budget of juvenile Antarctic krill in years with contrasting sea ice conditions	ICES JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE												Krill overwintering strategies vary with ontogeny and year; understanding this variability is essential to predicting how the species will respond to climate change in the future. Overwintering studies have focused on larval and adult krill, but we know little about how juvenile krill overwinter. The late winter diet of juvenile krill is important because it will determine their growth and development rates and consequently their reproductive potential the following spring. A diet rich in ice algae would promote growth and reproductive development. The Bransfield Strait (northern Antarctic Peninsula, AP) is an important overwintering ground for krill; it has been proposed this region offers a food-rich winter environment. We examined the contribution of ice algae to the energy budget of overwintering juvenile krill during 2 years with contrasting sea ice conditions. Grazing on ice algae contributed approximate to 146% to their winter energy budget in 2015, even though ice concentrations were 50% and consisted of newly formed pancake ice. However, when sea ice advanced late in the Bransfield Strait (2016), ice algae contributed significantly less (approximate to 16%) to the winter energy budget of juvenile krill. Delayed sea ice advance may negatively affect growth and reproductive development of overwintering juvenile krill.

Annual primary production in Antarctic sea ice during 2005-2006 from a sea ice state estimate	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS												Using the data-bounded Sea Ice Ecosystem State (SIESTA) model, we estimate total Antarctic sea ice algal primary production to be 23.7 Tg C a(-1) for the period July 2005-June 2006, of which 80% occurred in the bottom 0.2 m of ice. Simulated sea ice primary production would constitute 12% of total annual primary production in the Antarctic sea ice zone, and similar to 1% of annual Southern Ocean primary production. Model sea ice algal growth was net nutrient limited, rather than light limited, for the vast majority of the sunlit season. The seasonal distribution of integrated ice algal biomass matches available observations. The vertical algal distribution was weighted toward the ice bottom compared to observations, indicating that interior ice algal communities may be under-predicted in the model, and that nutrient delivery via gravity-induced convection is not sufficient to sustain summertime algal biomass. Bottom ice algae were most productive in ice of 0.36 m thickness, whereas interior algal communities were most productive in ice of 1.10 m thickness. Sensitivity analyses that tested different atmospheric forcing inputs, sea ice parameterizations, and nutrient availability caused mean and regional shifts in sea ice state and ice algal production even when sea extent and motion was specified. The spatial heterogeneity of both ice state and algal production highlight the sensitivity of the sea ice ecosystem to physical perturbation, and demonstrate the importance of quality input data and appropriate parameterizations to models of sea ice and associated biology.																	2169-9275	2169-9291				JUN	2014	119	6					3645	3678		10.1002/2013JC009677							WOS:000340414800024

Chemical composition and tissue energy density of the cuttlefish (Sepia apama) and its assimilation efficiency by Diomedea albatrosses	JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE PHYSIOLOGY B-BIOCHEMICAL SYSTEMIC AND ENVIRONMENTAL PHYSIOLOGY												The cuttlefish Sepia apama Gray (Mollusca: Cephalopoda) is a seasonally abundant food resource exploited annually by moulting albatrosses throughout winter and early spring in the coastal waters of New South Wales, Australia. To assess its nutritional value as albatross forage, we analysed S. apama for water, lipid protein, ash contents, energy density and amino acid composition. Because albatrosses consistently consume S. apama parts preferentially in the order of head, viscera and mantle, we analysed these sections separately, but did not identify any nutritional basis for this selective feeding behaviour. The gross energy value of S. apama bodies was 20.9 kJ/g dry mass, but their high water content (> 83%; cf < 70% for fish) results in a relatively low energy density of 3.53 kJ/g. This may contribute to a need to take large meals, which subsequently degrade flight performance. Protein content was typically > 75% dry mass, whereas fat content was only about 1%. Albatrosses feed on many species of cephalopods and teleost fish, and we found the amino acid composition of S. apama to be comparable to a range of species within these taxa. We used S. apama exclusively in feeding trials to estimate the energy assimilation efficiency for Diomedea albatrosses. We estimated their nitrogen-corrected apparent energy assimilation efficiency for consuming this prey to be 81.82 +/- A 0.72% and nitrogen retention as 2.90 +/- A 0.11 g N kg(-1) d(-1). Although S. apama has a high water content and relatively low energy density, its protein composition is otherwise comparable to other albatross prey species. Consequently, the large size and seasonal abundance of this prey should ensure that albatrosses remain replete and adequately nourished on this forage while undergoing moult.

Thysanoessa macrura in the southern Kerguelen region: Population dynamics and biomass	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY												Thysanoessa macrura is well adapted to the strong seasonality of the Southern Ocean. A flexible diet, large lipid reserves and a winter reproductive period provide T. macrura with the ability to capitalise on the pulses of primary and secondary reproduction in spring and summer. The population dynamics of T. macrura were examined over the southern Kerguelen Plateau region as part of a large-scale ecosystem assessment. Larval stages were present in high abundances, exceeding 4000 Ind. 1000 m(-3), with a peak in early furcilia (FI - FIV) and lower abundances of calyptopis stages (CI - CIII) indicating the end of a prolonged spawning period. High abundances of T. macrura were recorded throughout the entire study region, although they tended to be highest over the southern extent of the Banzare Bank and Princess Elizabeth Trough. This maximum appeared to be driven by the presence of the copepod Calanoides acutus, a dominant prey source. The first biomass estimates of T. macrura were determined for the region using length-frequency and abundance distributions. A mean biomass of 1.66 mg m(-3) (wet weight) was calculated for the region, however localised biomass over the southern tip of the Banzare Bank exceeded 9 mg m(-3) in the upper 200 m of the water column. The high biomass of T. macrura highlights their significance as an energy-rich resource for larger predators, inferring they play a currently underappreciated role in pelagic food-webs of the Southern Ocean.

Five stations were occupied along a 700 km transect southeastwards towards the western tip of South Georgia. Three stations were located north of the Antarctic Polar Front (PF) with mean primary production of 0.41 g C m(-2) d(-1) compared to 0.54 g C m(-2) d(-1) for the stations south of the front. Three stations were in the shelf break and off-shelf region to the east of South Georgia where the lowest rates of primary production were recorded (mean 0.34 g C m(-2) d(-1)). At a further 4 stations northwest of the island, primary production was significantly greater: 0.8 to 2.5 g C m(-2) d(-1) (mean 1.5 g C m(-2) d(-1)). Photoinhibition was a marked feature of the production profiles, resulting in the underestimation of column production by 4 to 16%. An assessment is made of the primary production required to maintain a representative assemblage of metazooplankton around South Georgia composed of 30 g fresh mass (FM) m(-2) krill and 20 g FM m(-2) copepods. The total C requirement of both groups at maximum growth rate is estimated as 0.93 g C m(-2) d(-1), with 0.54 g C m(-2) d(-1) required to maintain basal metabolism (i.e. for zero growth). Local primary production rates are well in excess of the C demands for basal metabolism by the metazooplankton, and likewise the highest regional values exceed those for maximum metazooplankton growth. It is also estimated that the krill biomass required to sustain higher predators during their breeding season could be supported by local production at plausible maximum krill growth rate. In particular, high primary production found in this study to the northwest of South Georgia appears to be adequate to sustain maximum growth rate by krill when their biomass is 30 g FM m(-2), when krill production will exceed predator removal. It is already well known that advection from,higher latitudes is important in supplying energy to the South Georgia system. This study adds to the evidence that locally enhanced primary production is also important in supporting the local food web.																	0171-8630						2002	242						51	62		10.3354/meps242051							WOS:000179463800005						
J	Priddle, J; Whitehouse, MJ; Atkinson, A; Brierley, AS; Murphy, EJ				Priddle, J; Whitehouse, MJ; Atkinson, A; Brierley, AS; Murphy, EJ			Diurnal changes in near-surface ammonium concentration - interplay between zooplankton and phytoplankton	JOURNAL OF PLANKTON RESEARCH												Data from a cruise in 1996 in the Southern Ocean near the island of South Georgia indicate that ammonium concentrations in near-surface waters (top 30 m of the water column) varied diurnally by similar to 0.2--0.35 mmol m(-3)day(-1)(3 h mean values) in different regimes. Maximum values (up to 1.3 mmol m(-3)) occurred around local midnight and minimum values (down to 0.1 mmol m(-3)) close to noon. This cyclicity was not found in other nutrients analysed (silicate, nitrate, nitrite and phos- phate). The potential for mixing ammonium-rich water from the pycnocline into the surface mixed layer (SML) at night is examined. Budget calculations for both ammonium and temperature suggest that complete mixing of the pycnocline water into the SML would increase concentration to observed levels. However, it would also give rise to changes in pycnocline ammonium concentration and temperatures which do not agree with observations. Moreover, such a model will not account for daytime drawdown, which is likely to be due to biological processes. A simple biological model combining night time excretion of ammonium by zooplankton and daytime uptake by phytoplankton simulates the observed change, but only if (i) the daily-averaged phytoplankton growth rate was of the order of 0.5-1 day(-1), (ii) this growth was strongly dependent on ammonium for its nitrogen nutrition, (iii) zooplankton grazing was sufficient to keep phytoplankton biomass at a constant level and (iv) much of the ingested nitrogen was excreted. The implications of these conditions are explored in the context of other observations during the study, and on the basis of published data. It appears that the re supply of inorganic nitrogen through zooplankton grazing may have been important in sustaining primary production, indicating a very tight coupling between grazers and their food supply. This conclusion is supported by comparison with results from a similar cruise in 1994. Then there was a reduction in the biomass of Antarctic krill, a major component of the zooplankton, to 14% of that observed in 1996. Diurnal change in ammonium concentration could not be detected and phytoplankton growth rate had been slower (about 0.25 d(-1)), providing support for the suggestion that biological processes were more important than physical mixing in generating ammonium cyclicity. The potential consequences for the biological cycling of carbon in high-and low-krill abundance years are discussed.

Understanding the demographic response of free-living animal populations to different drivers is the first step towards reliable prediction of population trends. 2. Penguins have exhibited dramatic declines in population size, and many studies have linked this to bottom-up processes altering the abundance of prey species. The effects of individual traits have been considered to a lesser extent, and top-down regulation through predation has been largely overlooked due to the difficulties in empirically measuring this at sea where it usually occurs. 3. For 10 years (2003-2012), macaroni penguins (Eudyptes chrysolophus) were marked with subcutaneous electronic transponder tags and re-encountered using an automated gateway system fitted at the entrance to the colony. We used multistate mark-recapture modelling to identify the different drivers influencing survival rates and a sensitivity analysis to assess their relative importance across different life stages. 4. Survival rates were low and variable during the fledging year (mean = 0.33), increasing to much higher levels from age 1 onwards (mean = 0.89). We show that survival of macaroni penguins is driven by a combination of individual quality, top-down predation pressure and bottom-up environmental forces. The relative importance of these covariates was age specific. During the fledging year, survival rates were most sensitive to top-down predation pressure, followed by individual fledging mass, and finally bottom-up environmental effects. In contrast, birds older than 1 year showed a similar response to bottom-up environmental effects and top-down predation pressure. 5. We infer from our results that macaroni penguins will most likely be negatively impacted by an increase in the local population size of giant petrels. Furthermore, this population is, at least in the short term, likely to be positively influenced by local warming. More broadly, our results highlight the importance of considering multiple causal effects across different life stages when examining the survival rates of seabirds.

Endemic Nototheniinae is the dominant fish group found in Antarctic marine habitats. Through their intermediate position within the food web, Nototheniinae link lower to higher trophic levels and thereby also form an important component of parasite life cycles. The study was set out to gain insight into the parasite fauna of Nototheniops larseni, N. nudifrons and Lepidonotothen squamifrons (Nototheniinae) from Elephant Island (Antarctica). Methods Sampling was conducted at three locations around Elephant Island during the ANT-XXVIII/4 expedition of the research vessel Polarstern. The parasite fauna of three Nototheniine species was analysed, and findings were compared to previous parasitological and ecological research collated from a literature review. Results All host species shared the parasites Neolebouria antarctica (Digenea), Corynosoma bullosum (Acanthocephala) and Pseudoterranova decipiens E (Nematoda). Other parasite taxa were exclusive to one host species in this study. Nototheniops nudifrons was infected by Ascarophis nototheniae (Nematoda), occasional infections of N. larseni with Echinorhynchus petrotschenkoi (Acanthocephala) and L. squamifrons with Elytrophalloides oatesi (Digenea) and larval tetraphyllidean Cestoda were detected. Conclusion All examined fish species' parasites were predominantly euryxenous regarding their fish hosts. The infection of Lepidonotothen squamifrons with Lepidapedon garrardi (Digenea) and Nototheniops larseni with Echinorhynchus petrotschenkoi represent new host records. Despite the challenges and limited opportunities for fishing in remote areas, future studies should continue sampling on a more regular basis and include a larger number of fish species and sampling sites within different habitats.																	1230-2821	1896-1851															10.1007/s11686-021-00455-8		JUL 2021					WOS:000673804000002	34275092

Potential energy gain by whales outside of the Antarctic: prey preferences and consumption rates of migrating humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae)	POLAR BIOLOGY												The humpback whale (Megaptera novaeangliae) makes annual migrations from Antarctic feeding grounds to tropical breeding grounds. The extent to which it feeds during migration is unknown, but thought to be very low. Whether an animal feeds during migration is likely dependent on prey availability and on the ease with which it can capture the available prey. This study used digital tags (DTAGs) and concurrent prey sampling to measure how changes in the depth and type of prey influenced the lunge feeding rates and the amount of energy consumed by migrating humpback whales. Whales targeting krill lunged at significantly higher rates than whales targeting fish; however, the depth of the prey did not influence lunge rate. The observed lunge rates when feeding on krill, to the best of our knowledge, are higher than any previously reported rates of whales feeding. Estimates of the energetic content of the prey ingested revealed that whales may consume between 1.2 and 3.4 times their daily energy requirements per day while feeding on krill during migration, but less when feeding on fish. This suggests that whales may begin to restock energy supplies prior to reaching the Antarctic. Determining how often this high rate of energy intake occurs along the migratory route will assist with understanding the contribution of migratory energy intake to annual energy budgets.

The model is based upon extensive seasonal data from 1995 to 2001. Phytoplankton, represented by samples of particulate organic matter from open water (Pelagic-POM) and ice algae, represented by samples from the underside of the ice (Ice-POM), were isotopically different. Ice-POM was generally dominated by the typical ice diatoms Nitzschia frigida and Melosira arctica and was more enriched than Pelagic-POM in C-13 (delta C-13 = -20 parts per thousand vs. -24 parts per thousand), but less enriched in N-15 (delta N-15 = 1.8 parts per thousand vs. 4.0 parts per thousand). However, when dominated by pelagic algae, Ice-POM was enriched in C-13 and N-15 similarly to Pelagic-POM. The derived trophic enrichment factors for delta N-15 (Delta(N) = 3.4 parts per thousand) and delta C-13 (Delta(C) = 0.6 parts per thousand) were similar in both pelagic and sympagic (ice-associated) systems, although the Delta(C) for the sympagic system was variable. Trophic level (TL) range for zooplankton (TL = 1.8-3.8) was similar to that of ice fauna (TL = 1.9-3.7), but ice amphipods were generally less enriched in delta N-15 than zooplankton, reflecting lower delta N-15 in Ice-POM compared to Pelagic-POM. For bulk zooplankton, TLs and carbon sources changed little seasonally, but the proportion of herbivores was higher during May-September than in October and March. Overall, we found that the primary carbon source for zooplankton was Pelagic-POM (mean 74%), but depending on species, season and TL, substantial carbon (up to 50%) was supplied from the sympagic system. For bulk ice fauna, no major changes were found in TLs or carbon sources from summer to autumn. The primary carbon source for ice fauna was Ice-POM (mean 67%), although ice fauna with TL > 3 (adult Onisimus nanseni and juvenile polar cod) primarily utilized a pelagic food source.

Circadian signaling in the Northern krill Meganyctiphanes norvegica: In silico prediction of the protein components of a putative clock system using a publicly accessible transcriptome	MARINE GENOMICS												The Northern krill Meganyctiphanes norvegica is a significant component of the zooplankton community in many regions of the North Atlantic Ocean. In the areas it inhabits, M. norvegica is of great importance ecologically, as it is both a major consumer of phytoplankton/small zooplankton and is a primary food source for higher-level consumers. One behavior of significance for both feeding and predator avoidance in Meganyctiphanes is diel vertical migration (DVM), i.e., a rising from depth at dusk and a return to depth at dawn. In this and other euphausiids, an endogenous circadian pacemaker is thought, at least in part, to control DVM. Currently, there is no information concerning the identity of the genes/proteins that comprise the M. norvegica circadian system. In fact, there is little information concerning the molecular underpinnings of circadian rhythmicity in crustaceans generally. Here, a publicly accessible transcriptome was used to identify the molecular components of a putative Meganyctiphanes circadian system. A complete set of core clock proteins was deduced from the M. norvegica transcriptome (clock, cryptochrome 2, cycle, period and timeless), as was a large suite of proteins that likely function as modulators of the core clock (e.g., doubletime), or serves as inputs to it (cryptochrome 1) or outputs from it (pigment dispersing hormone). This is the first description of a "complete" (core clock through putative output pathway signals) euphausiid clock system, and as such, provides a foundation for initiating molecular investigations of circadian signaling in M. norvegica and other krill species, including how clock systems may regulate DVM and other behaviors.																	1874-7787	1876-7478				FEB	2018	37						97	113		10.1016/j.margen.2017.09.001							WOS:000428974700017	28964713

Krill demography and large-scale distribution in the Western Indian Ocean sector of the Southern Ocean (CCAMLR Division 58.4.2) in Austral summer of 2006	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY												Krill demography was studied during a large-scale survey of the South Western Indian sector of the Southern Ocean conducted in late January to late February 2006 (BROKE-West). The survey progressed from 30 degrees E in late January to 80 degrees E in late February and was bounded in the North by 62 degrees S. The average krill density calculated from the catches of the RMT 8 net for four geographical strata ranged from 0.84-68 individuals per 1000 m(-3), with overall mean of 6.7 individuals per 1000 m(-3). Krill distribution and its population structure were analysed using cluster and mixture analysis of the length frequency distribution, showing small sized krill (modal size of 25-30 mm) broadly distributed in the centre of the western area whereas middle and large sized krill (modal size of 35-45 mm and 45-55 mm, respectively) mainly distributed in the middle and eastern half of the survey area. These findings are discussed in the context of the observed geographic and oceanographic structures; the continental slope area, fronts, currents and gyres. Proportional recruitment indices ranged 0.089-0.226 for R1 (age 1+ recruitment) and 0.204-0.440 for R2 (age 2+ recruitment) in the four strata. Recruitment analysis revealed differences between western and eastern halves of the surveyed area, suggesting the possible existence of separate self-sustaining populations linked to the Weddell Gyre and Prydz Bay Gyre systems. Krill larvae were mainly observed along the shelf break, implying the early onset of spawning in mid-November. The series of coastal polynyas developing in the early spring may be one of the important habitats allowing use of early season phytoplankton growth for early maturation and spawning, and those larvae would be transported westwards by the coastal current along the shelf slope.
