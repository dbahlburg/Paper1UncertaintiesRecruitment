(3) what is the influence of food availability versus that of light regime? to answer these questions, adult krill were starved under laboratory conditions for 12 weeks with constant light regime (12:12; dark/light) and the impact on physiological functions was studied. initial experimental condition of krill resembled the condition of late spring krill in the field with fully active metabolism and low lipid reserves. metabolic activity and activities of enzymes catabolising lipids decreased after the onset of starvation and remained low throughout, whereas lipid reserves declined and lipid composition changed. mass and size of krill decreased while the inter-moult period increased. depletion of storage- and structural metabolites occurred in the order of depot lipids and glycogen reserves after onset of starvation until proteins were almost exclusively used after 6-7 weeks of starvation. results confirmed various proposed overwintering mechanisms such as metabolic slowdown, slow growth or shrinkage and use of lipid reserves. however, these changes were set in motion by food shortage only, i.e. without the trigger of a changing light regime.",jun,2015,10.1007/s00300-014-1638-z,

(2) krill density showed substantial differences between day and night for autumn and winter surveys. (3) a spatial gradient was observed for krill size groups, with larger sized (adult spawning) krill further south and medium-sized juveniles and immatures mainly between 60a degrees and 67a degrees s.
