Part I: Circulation and particle tracking simulations,model,months,,1992-1993,Scotia Sea,,,,,larvae,,NA,,,,"No specific parameters as such. Paper focussed on successful transport of krill larvae to South Georgia, so transport within a certain timeframe is 'recruitment' to the South Georgia population. Identifies source regions (and links these to spawning areas) whereby krill larvae can reach the South Georgia region within 10 months, specifically West Antarctic Paninsula and Bransfield Strait, and identifies SACCF as key driver of transport. Inferred 20 months transport from NW Weddell Sea referencing Fach, 2003. Identifies latitudinal variability in location of SACCF as key influence on successful transport.",,,-,-,

A model is developed to show how ascent rate can be derived from temperature and time spent swimming. The model indicates that carbon utilization during the descent-ascent cycle will decrease by 15% along thewestern Weddell Sea and about 10% in most of the Ross Sea. In these two regions hatching depth will shoalby 100–150 m and the krill development time will shorten by 10–15% (Figures 2a–2c,,,-,-,

It was assumed that i) patches are formed passively and composed of young krill released from the sea ice edge zone and ii) the positions of patches have shifted southward from one century ago as a result of a southward shift of the ice edge.

of the change in spatial pattern of the source for surface patches due to
the effects of a southward shift of sea ice",,,-,validation,

These krill were seen to be feeding based on their green guts. The authors were unable to quantify the densities/abundances of krill. Some krill sampled from the water column  had empty guts and no planktonic algae was observed witin the water column. Krill within ice covered waters were associated with sea ice and aggregated in areas of high ice algae abundance, particularly in pressure zones or where first year ice was melting, and hollows and crevices. In twilight more krill were found in the water column, suggesting movement between patches. Authors found krill starting form swarms in early spring suggesting a change to pelagic feeding. ",,,-,-,
